      " Last night I dreamt I was visiting a friends house on the beach. We were watching the waves and they were huge. I was excited to play in them. Then we were inside the house and I looked out and the waves were right at the window and started crashing against the house. All of a sudden the house just tilted. We had to lay against the wall as the house started rocking back and forth from the waves. I told her I didn't think this was okay and she said it happened all the time and that it was okay. The whole house was rocking and water was leaking in but I trusted the girl who was telling me that it was totally normal. I feel like the waves were rocking my foundation? But I'm not sure.\n",

      " So some background: I’ve been having really vivid dreams the past couple of weeks, but usually they’re just weird and random. I’ve had dreams where I’ve woken up right before I would die, but never where I actually died until this dream. This is one of the handful that I have actually woken up scared from. \n",

      "Last night, I had a dream where my family and I went to New York on vacation. We were on one of those open ferry boats looking at the Statue of Liberty. We were the only people on the boat besides the tour guide. There were huge waves rocking the boat, and I remember having fun at first while we were on the main body of water. It appeared to be coming from barges, but there were lots of other boats crowding the river. Well, when we were done with our tour, we went to go dock the ferry and get off. We entered this small channel and there were two barges creating a ton of waves. The waves kept getting bigger and bigger and I remember watching out the side at how huge the waves were. Up until this point, I was happy; it was a fun dream. There was one huge wave that knocked the boat over and I remember right before the wave hit the side of the boat, I looked at my parents and thought I should tell them I love them. Then the wave hit the boat and flung me from it. While I was in the air, I felt calm. I knew I was about to die, but I knew there was nothing I could do about it, so I let go. I watched as I headed straight towards the waves coming out of a barge and I felt the impact when I hit the water and was sucked under with the current. Then, I remember watching the light fade as I sunk deeper, and then I remember just relaxing and breathing the water in. That’s when everything went black for a couple of seconds. When a picture came back into focus, I’m now outside of my body watching my lifeless body float under the water in the river against the dock wall. Right before I woke up, there was an image of a computer screen making it look like this was a simulation or alternate universe. \n",
