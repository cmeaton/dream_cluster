Then we were inside the house and I looked out and the waves were right at the window and started crashing against the house. All of a sudden the house just tilted. We had to lay against the wall as the house started rocking back and forth from the waves. I told her I didn't think this was okay and she said it happened all the time and that it was okay. The whole house was rocking and water was leaking in but I trusted the girl who was telling me that it was totally normal. I feel like the waves were rocking my foundation? But I'm not sure.\""
