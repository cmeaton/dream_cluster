"I was in my home city and right by the water when tidal waves started crashing over the streets. I climbed to the top of a tree and held on as tight as I could but the waves continued crashing and I saw many people swalled up in the current. When there was a break in the waves, I jumped down and swam to shore, where I climbed up a bridge and ran away. Once I was safe, my vantage point zoomed out to space where I saw one big wave crash over the whole pacific coast and to my surprise, went over the cascades, across the rockies, great plains, appalachians, and eventually into the atlantic ocean. The whole country was submerged in water."
