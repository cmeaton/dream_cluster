There was a murder in the field and the murderer planted a bunch of fake evidence.

I finally picked a pair of leather loafers that felt loose and didnt fit me, but it fits my budget so I proceeded with it. I stood in line at the counter to pay for my shoes when I noticed a red digital clock that said 12:48 pm. Work started at 1:00 pm, I started freaking out over being late, and then I woke up.

2. This one occured today. I was with my coworkers and we were having a dumb dance competition. My shoes were missing, and i panicked, for i was the next performer. My shoes were missing, and i started thinking maybe i could ask one of my coworkers if they can lend me their shoes. It wasnt actually even a shoe, it was an ugly, knee high, rain boot that didnt looked like it'd fit me. I shrugged at the idea, and kept looking for my shoes.

We were playing basketball on a rooftop court in Brooklyn, playing 5v5 for about 1 hour.

Shaq was on my team, and I didn't recognize any of the other players. It was a fun game, good vibe all around.

I remember having some conversation with Shaq right after the game. I told him I obviously expected us to take a selfie, just so I had something to remember that day. After that, we took a walk downstairs and started talking about stuff like where I lived and what I did and things like that.

He asked some very insightful questions, and encouraged me to move to NYC. I told him how I once considered it for a while, but was out of my possibilities, and we just kept talking.

I saw him get on his car (Something similar to a Hummer, but slightly different), and knocked on his window to say goodbye and told him that if I went through with him I'd come by to this place and have a chat.

That seemed to make him super happy, so he got out of his car and walked with me to my car. He kept giving me advice on how to get to the point where I could actually move there, and other stuff.

I remember recognizing the view from the rooftop, the buildings around us, and it all just felt so familiar.

Of course I have never been in that rooftop, or anywhere similar, but it felt like home.

It had been years since I felt a dream so real and such a lasting sensation after waking up.

0.0,5ab15k,2.0,1.0,"It was the eve of Purim (a Jewish holiday). Me and a few friends, one of them I recognize as a childhood friend, Assaf, walk with a large crowd to the great hall of my home town, Hertzeliya. A religious performance is due, and the excitement is felt. Strangely, although I am surrounded by this great mass of people and friends, I feel alone, and I recall other friends who have long departed from our hometown. I miss them, and envy the courageous act of leaving Hertzeliya, to live a different life. 

As we enter the great hall, I meet another old friend, Lior, who greets me very distantly, with a pinch of disdain and scorn. I do not replay; I do not care much for his opinion of me. Surprisingly, Assaf, the friend who accompanied me to the great hall, leaves my side to joins Lior, and says his farewell in a contemptuous fashion as well. Unlike my reaction to Lior's contempt, I grow angry with Assaf. Just before I express my anger, I am distracted by the sigh of my family occupying the hall's first row of seats. I recognize my mother and father, and an aunt, and just a row behind them, I see my dying grandfather. I walk up to him, and ask for his well-being. He mumbles unintelligibly. I caress his dry crumpled and crumbling exposed feet for a while, and then I notice a Hispanic looking man, sitting right next to him. He is a stranger, and I do not understand his role and why he has accompanied my grandfather to the hall. He has a light brown skin, a round face, and a mustache decorates his upper lip. His intelligent eyes gaze upon me, observing, but not intrusively. I look back at him, calmly – staring right into his eyes. He says not a word. 

Due to the fact that it is her father that is dying, I approach my mother. I stand next to her, and ask for her well-being. She instantly begins to sob, and mumbles ""I am not well, I feel bad"". I caress her short blond hair for a while.

Anger and sorrow floods me, as I reflect on Assaf's desertion and my family's difficult time. I decide that I will go and give Assaf my piece of mind, and leave the great hall to mourn my sorrow. I walk up to him, and give him the finger, however I am astonished to discover that it is not Assaf, but someone who highly resembles him. I immediately withdraw my offence, and am thankful that the person did not notice and neither anyone of my family. I then see Assaf, Lior and a few other young men standing a few rows above, participating in what seems to be a meaningful conversation. I dissolve the urge to scold Assaf, and leave the great hall. 

It is early morning outside. I sit on the curbstone in front of the hall, and a group of young religious children move by. They are led by a young adolescent lithe girl. I start to argue with the group on matters of spirituality. The subject of the argument revolves my spiritual faculty. The group argues that it is weak while I argue otherwise. I use my sorrow to win the argument. The young girl accepts defeat, her face sombre but also warm and affectionate, as if she is suggesting that there was additional hidden reason for the argument that I do not understand, and missed completely. The group leaves. 

I am left alone in the desolate street, in front of the great hall. Nylon bags and dry leafs drift past me.

I'm usually outside, it's a rainy night, not raining, but the ground is certainly wet. There's street lights. They form a circle over a ""communal area"" like a group of benches/concrete ornaments outside - designed for people to sit and socialise.

Across the pathway, by a building made entirely of glass - sort of like an office block, there's a group of friends whom I used to meet for a sunday club for kids. I ran the group, so identify with the adults. There's a white transit van with two men. Both wearing blue coveralls.

One gets out to the left, and drops his Nokia 3310 and as I pick it up to hand it back, I get stabbed with a piece of white plastic. Odd in shape, sort of resembling a cuttlefish but pure white, and somewhat two-dimensional.

This is where I wake up

The lifts/elevators were all voice controlled by staff, and could access a floor based on the person whom you visited. E.g. if my partner Shannon, was staying on the sixth floor, but I didn't know, I'd be able to get to her room by asking for Shannon.

I was talking to a friend about gay rights, and how even though I'm straight, I'm all for it. It's completely irrelevant whether or not someone likes penis.

I was using the toilet, and the staff very violently interrupted me mid-pee to throw me out. It was their policy to be against gay people and therefore not allow homosexual guests or those who support them. 

I was then not allowed to go to my partners room, and was forced into a lounge area where a senior staff member explained this to me. Whilst very out of character for me, I got irate, and punched him. I then said something along the lines of;

*""If you want to continue acting the way you are, there's one thing you never want to do. Anger, me!""*

Very movie-script esque, dramatic. I then look up to my rear/offside and there's this bodybuilder thug type, covered in tattoos, has muscles - punches his clenched fist into his hand.

I can't remember what happens to link to the next ""scene"" but I spot Louis Spence behind the bar, telling how he hates gay people, to promote the bar - but then gives me this ""knowing"" look of how he's really there as some form of covert operative.

For those who don't know, Louis Spence, is a very camp dancer here in the UK, and is widely known for being gay, and feminine.

Last night I dreamt I was house/pet sitting for someone in my childhood home. Their snake was about three feet long and thick like this: http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Snakes111.jpg and this snake's name was Elaphia which is what my favorite 6th grade teacher named her tiny white albino snake.
I was holding Elaphia and feeling uncomfortable, snakes feel weird, and I put her down when my brother asked me a question. I couldn't find the snake after that. Looked everywhere. Found a tiny playful white kitten but no snake. I ended up having to tell this person I lost her snake and I felt terrible. She was angry at first but forgave me and hugged me. She had pink/purple glitter lips like no other lip product I've ever seen. No idea who she was.
The last time I saw a snake in my dreams there were a few of them in some trees, they were green and small and could fly. Super weird. 

At some point I jumped into a pool intending to touch the bottom and then shoot up to the surface. I kept going deeper and deeper and but I hadn't reached the bottom yet and the water was getting dark around/above me. I could feel the pressure of the water and my ears kind of popping and got scared so swam up as quick as I could to get air. I noticed as I got closer to the surface I could breathe slowly underwater. I've never had a dream with a pool that deep/dark before. 

Also there was an older woman, like a teacher, and she and I had the same name. I pointed it out twice while talking with her.

I also have reoccurring dreams of being on or near a beach and giant tidal waves are seen. They never touch me or the people I'm with but we all realize we need to gtfo of the area. Sometimes the waves rise up and then just kind of sprinkle down on top of your head no biggie. Sometimes the waves reach all the way up to the window/street just a few feet away from you. 

TLDR - Lost a mystery woman's pet snake, found a white kitten while searching for the snake. Dove into a deep pool that went so deep I couldn't touch the bottom. Reoccurring dreams of giant tsunami waves that never actually touch me.

So last night I began dreaming of travelling down a highway, going the wrong way at some point, but then correcting myself.  The next thing I remember was being parked at my great uncle's house in my wife's car with her there by my side.  We got out and walked around, only to find that my uncle had a pet tiger.  Now this tiger had this look about her that you could just tell she was wild and untamed, despite the fact that she had never hurt anybody.  I faced the tiger head on, locking eyes with the beast while my wife found the safety of the car once again.  I kept my eyes locked onto the tiger long enough, then began backing my way toward the car again.  

Once in the car, I realized that my wife and I had gotten in the WRONG car and I told her I would distract the tiger while she got in her car and drove away.  Why we didn't BOTH get in her car, I don't know.  Well eventually she had gotten away safely and I was left with the tiger.  

Skip to the next thing I remember, my uncle inviting me to stay the night.  I was in the spare bedroom of his house and was using the shower and such, but I kept wondering how I was going to sleep soundly knowing that there was a tiger in the house.  I knew that if I could shut the bedroom door and keep the tiger out of my room I would be able to sleep soundly, but the bedroom door was made of some weak, slatted wood, like you see some closet doors made of.  Several times, while there, I was forced to face off with the tiger again, making no sudden movements so as not to cause her to attack.  There was even one time where she put her nose up against me to kind of test me out, and I just stayed still.  

The animal was not violent or even angry in appearance, but I was just so nervous about whether or not it would go feral and attack me.

I could feel it building in my body, a very intense energy that made my legs feel like I was being shocked by a taser and the rest of my body tingled like some ambient electric energy was making my hair stand up.

When we were inside going to our table I saw my Grandma and Grandpa standing there at the age they were when I was younger. I was wow'd to see my Grandpa because he passed away years ago. He just smiled and gave me a big hug. I remember it so vividly like it actually happened.

Why would I have this dream? What does it mean? I have not thought about him in so long. It was random but really nice. It almost felt like he was telling me I was doing ok. ",new,Saw my dead Grandpa in my dream.,1.0

""All dreams are healthy, says Morgan, because they reveal our emotions and show us issues that need to be dealt with in our lives. She doesn't suggest avoiding bad dreams altogether but facing them head-on by writing them down and thinking about them. However, if you're having an unpleasant dream that you want to stop, there is a three-step plan she recommends for dealing with the situation.""",new,A 3-Step Guide for Getting Rid of Bad Dreams,2.0

I'd sit there and remove the needles with my other hand only for some of them to embed in the fingers removing them. It seemed like and endless cycle of which I would wake up-- look at my hands and then try and grasp the reality that it was just a dream then go back to sleep.

This cycle went on for at least 3 times of waking up/going back to sleep. When I finally decided to get out of bed my fingers still tingled from the pain in the dream.  It was never an intense pain, but more of an annoyance and frustration of trying to remove them all.

This is my first time posting here, but I've had lucid dreams before, but it's been awhile. I'm curious if anyone has some idea to the meaning or that have experienced the same?

tl;dr: repetitive dream of barbed needles from plant that I couldn't get out of my fingertips. woke several times just to go back to same dream.",hot,Needles in fingertips,1.0
