0.0,asazbm,0.0,1.0,"So I had a dream about a week ago where me and a close friend wanted to have sex with each other. Bit of context, my friend is very attractive but I would never pursue anything like a hook up or a relationship with them in real life as they're like my little sister and their boyfriend is one of my best mates. 

So back to the dream... We were in bed in a room with other people and right as the dream gets to the intercourse we're not actually banging and it's like there's force fields around me and her so it's just not happening. We're both ready to get down and dirty there's like an invisible force stopping us from ***fornicating,*** as this is happening someone in the room wakes up and I tell my friend to be quiet and she screams out ""I don't care, we're dating now!"" at the top of her lungs. I then travelled to another part of the dream seemingly unrelated to that situation in the dream.

When I woke up I was just like what the fuck just happened? And even now like a week later I'm still thinking the same thing.

Just wondering if someone can help me figure out what it means? Anything to add besides the fact that I kind of answered my own question by saying I'd never pursue them in that way in real life would be much appreciated.",new,Sex But Not Really... What Does it Mean?,1.0

1. I was invited to dinner at my departed Grandfather's house;

2. When I arrived all of my family were dead but seated, so I became de facto host;

3. The guests were Nosferatu and his friends;

4. I couldn't find the food or drinks that had been promised because it wasn't my house. Everything I found was rotten;

5. My guest Nosferatu had brought a goats head that he wanted served raw, hair and all;

6. Everyone wanted different, specific drinks that I couldn't provide (with an overtone of menace);

7. The animal frescoes on the walls and ceilings came to life and threatened me for failing my guests while Nosferatu crawled up my leg from beneath the table while chanting in a language I couldn't understand.

0.0,asavcq,2.0,1.0,"I’ve had some interesting very deep dreams last night but I kinda mixed them up together and I don’t remember them quite well. So first off I had a dream in a dream, but actually two of them. Two different dreams in one single dream. Also all of them included buses somehow, and picking off the bus from the wrong side (so it goes in the opposite direction), a funny mistake I occasionally did in real life. 

So I remember in one of them I took a bus next to the local shop (where there isn’t even a bus stop irl) and realized I took it on the wrong side after getting in it and I was so… idk, done with it? That careless + tired feeling, that I just thought “fuck it, might as well go on the wrong side and wait for it to turn around”. 

In another one, not sure if the same one or the other dream (out of the 2, inside the big dream) I took a bus on the wrong side but thought that “since it’s already over half of route I’ll just go with it and wait for it to turn around at the end”, even tho irl this wouldn’t make sense and wouldn’t be time efficient at all. 

Another scene I remember is being with Leo (classmate I get along with very well) at a light red church/monastery/religious building which seemed very familiar. After thinking a bit irl, I actually had a dream about this church before! It’s really interesting to have recurring locations inside your dream world. Anyway, getting past it was an university (campus) with a lot of students and we wanted to find a bus station or a destination or something so we asked the students around how to get there and they said it’s over the wall, but we had no idea how to get past that wall??

And the most epic one was where I got off a bus at night, in some random location, which also was red (buildings, walls, etc.) that I didn’t know of and I didn’t know how to get home, but knew the direction, and at this point I became sort of half-lucid and thought that I have to concentrate hard and try to get home, and even though it was prolly a few km to my house, my view sort of ripped in half and I got in a few seconds in my neighborhood and eventually inside my apartment building, divine light shined the way to my apartment somehow. Once I opened the door to my apartment I see a clone of me surrounded by divine light around his head (like saints in religious icons) and even around his bodies, I tell it “I love you” and I wake up (in another dream). 

And I dreamed a ton of other shit I don’t remember as well. What was weird about these dreams was that they didn’t feel like those “important” dreams, they weren’t vivid, emotional, they were easily forgettable, etc. but if you actually think about their content they seem deep as shit. 

Analysis: The only things I know now is that what I said in the 3nd paragraph probably means something I did irl that I started the wrong way but considering it’s half-finished might as well finish the process. And the wall in the 4th paragraph probably means “Once I get past this obstacle I’ll get to my destination”. The dreambible.com entry for “church” also seems legit: *“To dream of a church represents your need for answers to a life problem that is bothering you. You need insight, a solution, or some kind of guidance about what direction to take, or why something is happening to you. You may have reached a crossroads. You may be asking yourself ""What am supposed do with this situation?"" or ""What am supposed to do my life now?”* “.

In my dreams I can feel pleasure, love, I can express myself, and I'm very much in tune with my full potential and capabilities as a human. All my senses work great! But in reality everything is pretty dull and lackluster. I don't feel much physical or emotional pleasure (not sexual, not romantic, no enthusiasm). But the twist to all this is that it used to be the other way around for sure. I used to feel pleasure in real life and everything was vivid and normal, just like my dreams are now. Something in my brain changed around 3 years ago for me. I'm 25 now.

I'm not on medication and I don't feel depressed, depersonalized, or anything. I am content with life and have come to a place of acceptance about most things. I live life with no regrets and I feel truly blessed to have the life I have. I'm fairly stable except for bad PMS every month. I'm also in a stable relationship with a very sweet and caring man.

It's just so frustrating to wake up into monotony and only be able to feel things in my dreams! Everything from excitement to genuine laughter and happiness. (The real worst for me is that sexual feelings and sensations are only felt in my dreams!). Definitely screws with relationships when you can only orgasm in your dreams, and in real life you're basically numb. Every day is such a dichotomy due to this. Medically, I'm told I'm fine, so no clue what the deal is. 

Anyway, just wanted to get this off my chest since it's super annoying and has been happening for a few years now. I feel like I'm living a double life! But at least I get to feel something, if only in my dreams?

See?"" because there were water beads on the ceiling and water filling up the glass lamp shade on the ceiling fixture. I took it down and there was about 2 inches of water in it and said to my grandma, ""You could keep a goldfish in here!"" She laughed and replied, ""I could at that!"" 

We went upstairs and other family members were there, packing up the house. The house had always been very clean and austere. It was the type of place with bookends and plastic fruit on the coffee table. I looked around and thought ""how severe."" 

There were many locked doors and dark staircases, much more than in the original house from real life. There was a bit of a creepy feeling and it was painted the kind of green that looks like Frankenstein's monster'skin.

She was pleased to see this diary and opened it and started reading aloud, she had been writing about how she learned about aerodynamics and thermal drafts.

So it's a few dreams and sometimes they're interconnected. I'll give you some background on me, and what the dream means to me and what I think it kind of means at the end of each description. I'm not looking for anything super specific I know that's hard to do, unless ya'lls got time I'm all ears, but I'm really looking for direction and overall themes of what the dreams could mean, why they're connected, and an idea of what my mind is trying to tell me.

Me: 22 y/o female, suffering a mental illness that jacked up my life. Functional Neurological disorder/Conversion disorder, I was going to art school and the illness messed up my arms so I couldn't draw anymore and had to drop out and am awaiting treatment. Traumatic and abusive childhood (that's what the disorder stems from). I'm a logical and factual type of person but also intuitive, creative, objective. (INTJ if ya'll know MBTI)  Strong believer in Jesus Christ. If you need more info let me know. I lived in a one bedroom scrapheap for 7 years of my life with 2 other people  and just recently moved to a nicer apartment. Idk maybe this will help anyone help me if they know a little of what I'm going through right now.

&#x200B;

Dream #1: I've been temporarily placed into a fixer upper home, while waiting for my new apartment to be ready to move into. Something bad always happens there, it's a big mansion but kind of jacked up. Even though it is a nicer place then where I came from. In multiple renditions of this dream there was a shootout, in another one people broke into my window to attack me, in another one the neighbor had a bear and a lion that tried to break into the home and chase me. Nothing ever goes right in that house even though it's big and spacious and I think it's nice. I always ask my mom why can't we go to our new apartment but she says we have to wait. This dream comes and goes and repeats itself in different situations but it's always the same kind of house and something bad always happens.

 (I don't know what this is about I thought it was fear of moving or something, but I moved and still have the same dream) 

Dream #2: I am staying at my moms old friends house, that I used to live with irl. We are staying there until we find a new apartment and to get food. But some how my ex-best friends mom is living there too. Sometimes the house has multiple rooms with different random people in it sleeping or partying in different renditions of the dream. My ex friend also comes in an out during different points in different dreams being crazy and rude to me. In real life she did something terrible that made me break up with her and in the dream when I see her I remind her of this and she is mean and not remorseful at all. I get very angry about it and its up in a dramatic fight then I wake up. 

Another part of the dream is during our stay at that house, every Thursday at 8 pm there is a gang shootout 'sport' where cannibals shoot through the neighborhood and house. After they're done with their game they have a feast and eat the people they killed. I always have to hide under something laying real flat while people in the home get shot and it's scary. In different renditions of this dream, my grandma was with me, and my mom and brother. I had to protect them and warn them what would happen at 8.

So in real life I moved into a new apartment and the dream shifted. Same situation but my mom and brother are with me in the dreams. I'm always begging them to go home to our new place and asking why we have to stay there since we have somewhere to live. I try to get them to leave before 8 and sometimes we do and go to our 'new home', sometimes we don't and have to deal with the gang. This dream mixes and matches on different days but the themes and situations always revolve around these things. 

(So I'm confused about my friend being in this dream, we broke up yes, but I don't have bad feelings towards her she just wasn't a good friend to me and I accept that...does it mean I need to reconnect with her to get closure or something. I don't know? Irl she's very remorseful for what she's done but somehow my dream keeps showing me that. As far as the house and gang thing, I have nooo idea.)

&#x200B;

Dream #3: We move in to our new home and we love it, but we see another one that is cheaper so we move again. It's a weird ever changing house. I always have to look for my rabbit in there as she is always escaping. In the 'cheaper' home it's in a bad area next to where my first house in real life was. There are weird crazy people and drug addicts all around. I go down the street to the liquor store and someone is always shot there or something dangerous happens and I end up having to run to my very old house. There is an old man that I talk to on the way to the old house and he gives me a trinket of a rose. This dream comes and goes in different ways sometimes it's just the first part, or just the 2nd part. Sometimes this dream fuses with the others. 

(A lot of this dream has to do with my rabbit escaping and it evokes feelings of being scared and anxious and deprived. I don't know why we move into the weird cheaper house, but it has weird changing and upsidedown infrastructure) 

&#x200B;

Dream #4: I'm at my old high school and somehow during the day there is a massive flood that goes higher and higher. The students and I end up trapped in a tall building or a secluded cave. We have to jump off a cliff and land directly into the rescue boats to be saved but sometimes in other renditions of the dreams the boats don't show up and I just wake up. 

(I don't know there is a flood but no one drowns)

0.0,as8lpz,9.0,5.0,"I had a dream that essentially revolved around speeding to the end of some kind of ancient Aztec tunnel. The tunnel was surrounded by a black void and it looped in a sideways 'U' shape. At the end, a floating brown tablet appeared and began displaying text like an autonomous command prompt. To be specific, a line of multicoloured, cartoon infant creatures wearing afraid/devastated faces were on display in-front of me and the floating tablet was contemplating through its changing text what their purpose was/what I should do with them.

After a few moments, the tablet decided that we could simply 'erase' the infants. At that moment the creatures started dissipating into thin air, the tablet then read the aforementioned sentence 'Cia la puro purgo houka lid' on its body. At the time the 'la' made me wonder if the tablet was speaking French but I woke up before anything else happened.

This has of course left me wondering if the sentence has any meaning or a connection to purging multicoloured juveniles.",new,Does the sentence 'Cia la puro purgo houka lid' have any meaning?,5.0

My dad and I were going to a beauty contest that I was entered in. We were driving there, but 

we first passed a huge cemetery with many statues with abstract looks and faces. I explained to 

my dad that these statues were a way to house spirits so they wouldn’t haunt others. Something 

for the ghosts to possess. We arrive at the building where the contest is being held, and the host 

comes out to greet us. He states that the building is “super haunted” but that we shouldn’t have 

to worry about it. He leads us down some hallways which goes to the dressing area. I am 

supplied with make-up and the sort, as he explains I’ll be next shortly. I quickly put the make-up 

on that had pink glitter. I thought it looked good, so I went with it. I threw on a pink and white 

gown, and proceeded to the entrance of the stage. The host runs out onto the stage. “Ladies 

and gentlemen! Let me introduce you to our new contestant, Trisha Sowash!” I walk out onto the 

stage, and the crowd is so quiet, I could hear my own footsteps. I continue down the walkway 

not phased by the silence. I stop at the end of the walkway and stare off into the crowd, the 

deafening silence rings in my ears, as I then turn around and exit the stage. As I leave I see the 

woman that was after me walk onto the walkway, and all I could hear was about half or so of the 

crowd cheering for her. All I thought was “Tough crowd”. I enter the lobby of the building, it’s 

packed with people examining the beauties, dresses and all. Two men were talking a ways 

away. “If you want to keep your job, you should coach Trisha, the new one. She’s pretty much 

your only option”, the man sitting responded with “But nobody cheered for her! I can’t accept 

someone who nobody likes!” I turn away, saddened by the truth that nobody liked my 

performance. After a little more wandering around the lobby, I started coughing, catching a scent 

coming off me that was really killing my throat. People around me start asking if I’m okay, all I do 

is cough, then my neck, arms, and hands burned so hot, my skin was bleeding and blistering. I 

was having an allergic reaction to the make-up I was wearing. I started screaming from the pain, 

and I was hurried to a sink to wash off the make-up as fast as possible. I washed my neck, with 

slowly warming water, which then turned hot, burning my arms and hands greatly. I couldn’t stop 

crying from the stinging pain. I quickly switched it to cold water, which soothed the pain slightly. 

My dad was watching all of this happening, as I cried and begged for the pain to stop. My mom 

was rushing to get help. I finally woke up in a hospital, my burns were mostly gone, but I could 

tell they were still raw. As my parents were checking me out of the hospital, I waited in a dreary 

medically green room, like a corporal green waiting room. A small child walked up to me and 

said hello, I looked at her, the top of her head was completely flat, as if her skull wasn’t but half 

developed, I gladly played with her, and she really appreciated it. “Thank you for playing with 

me! Nobody really wants to play with me because of the way I look..” I respond “Well I think 

you’re a very swell kiddo” she beams at me “Thank you!” Her mom returns from the checking 

her out of hospice, and she sees me and the child playing. “Thank you for playing with her, not 

many people play with her due to her condition” I respond “It’s no problem, she’s a very sweet 

kid” They say goodbye, and leave. Sometime later, I wander around the town, it looked to be by 

the coast, brick roads and old fashioned lamps to brighten the way. It was foggy, but there was 

sun here and there. I find a friend of mine that I also met in the hospital, I believe it was the 

sister of the child with the deformity. She asked me to follow her, and so I did. We rushed 

through the town, bridges, and seabirds on the way down. I spot a few doctors checking on the 

small child with the deformity. I sit to the side and observe her. She was asleep in her mother’s 

arms. The doctor pointed to the small child’s head, small crown like points were forming around 

the once flat area of the top of her head. “She is making good progress” the doctor spoke. “How 

is it good progress?” I asked, as it seemed to look off from good. “It’s better than flat” I nodded in 

understanding, and the doctors packed up and left. I wave goodbye to the mother and sister as 

they left. I make my way back to the hotel that I and my parents were staying in. I make it up to 

the floor which had the sink I washed off the make-up in. I enter the hallway of the room. My dad 

asks if I would like burgers or hotdogs. I choose hotdogs. “Can you go get the ----- out of the 

car?” I don’t remember what he asked me to get. I walked out of our room and proceeded to the 

car, but first, I walked up to the sink I washed off at, looking in the mirror. I got something on my 

hand from the sink, something that felt like soap. I paid it no mind, it was just soap after all. I go 

around the corner, and smell the scent of the make-up. It wasn’t soap. I rushed to the sink 

terrified, and my hand burned as I was washing it off. 

… I wake up in my bed, in real life, with my neck, arms, and hands burning.

We head up the escalator but for some reason I was hanging off the side of it. Then I was teleported again to inside a game. Nioh specifically. And then I battled my good friend(we'll call her T) in the game. I almost killed her too. Then I was teleported again to a rubiks cube world. I was with T and we were rubiks cubes. On the floor were white and grey tiles and we had to bounce on the white tiles or we'd die. Then, while this whole rubiks cube thing was still going on,  T and I were transported to an audience of sorts. There was a projector screen showing us as rubiks cubes in the rubiks cube world. After a while, T and I were failing to bounce on the rubiks cubes in the screen. Then in-audience me thought ""T's gonna die, isn't she?"" and I was getting really worried about her. Then, outta nowhere, Jammy Nutron and his family showed up at the place where T and I were.

0.0,as7rtf,1.0,3.0,"I have a lot of recurring characters in my dreams, and I wonder if they mean anything. Here are some examples: 

Monty Burns from the simpsons- always acts as a role model or mentor in my dreams. His first appearance was in 7th grade where he taught me that washing your face hid your scent from the mannequins (long story)

Balloon parents- a red balloon and a green or blue balloon that act as parental figures. Their first appearance was in the 2nd grade in a dream where I was adopted by balloons. For 4 years there were dreams here and there that told a story of me rejecting them, learning to love them, and then mourning their deaths. Last appearance was in the 6th grade in a dream where they promised to take me minigolfing, but got leaks and couldn't take me and died. It was very sad and still gives me a nostalgic sadness thinking about it today.

My deceased grandma- always acts as a useless side character. First appearance was in an alien invasion dream shortly after she started staying at my house in the 2nd grade. Is worth noting that my dads treatment of her drove away most of my friends until her expiry in the fourth grade. Stopped showing up in freshman year of high school.

My aunt - my favorite aunt, dies of terminal illness in all of the dreams she is in, sad every time. It is worth noting that she is perfectly healthy.

My brother-acts as a character to be saved from everything from car accidents to witch attacks

My actual parents- only exist in dreams where they disappear putting my brother and I in a predicament  or act as a deus ex machina.

Mannequins- faceless hordes that act as bystanders or antagonists. Likely just a placeholder.

Unspeakable horror- puppeteer, final boss, factory, evil witch, it takes many forms but is the same entity. Main antagonist of all of my dreams. 

Penguins of Madagascar- a recurring gag in which the penguins of Madagascar blow up the moon.

0.0,as72cv,2.0,1.0,"This is getting out of hand. Last night in my dreams I was this white woman who found herself in the middle of a terrorist attack inside a mall. I said the cheesiest one-liner and then pulled out an AK-47 and a grenade launcher out of a bystander's ear. Next I turned to face the terrorists, all 4 of whom are exactly identical black women (I know what you are thinking and the answer's no). I killed the first with the AK, and ran out of ammunition after like 4 shots. The second woman attacked me and trapped me inside a room, so I whipped out the grenade launcher. Turns out it shot out smoke grenades, not actual grenades. My adversary prepared to shoot me so I shot a smoke grenade at her throat. That killed her. The last two hid inside a Raising Cane's and detonated a bomb. I was on the second floor of the mall so I jumped off the railing as the fiery blast sped towards me. A disembodied voice proclaimed the physics fact of the day: explosions can't travel downwards. True or not I ended up breaking all the bones in my body. My last memory of the dream was watching my avatar in third person being wheeled out by an ER team while flashing a thumbs-up sign.

This dream wasn't the first of its kind. A couple months back I was this catgirl fascist ninja-wizard overseeing a hostage exchange. Said catgirl fascist ninja-wizard was this ridiculous OC from my middle school days that somehow resurfaced in this dream. She wore a green beret, white muscle shirt, and green pants with metal boots for kicking and a machete for shivving. Her special ability is that she converts the kinetic energy from her physical attacks into explosions. This will be important later on. During the dream, I was one of the two bodyguards overseeing a hostage exchange. The other bodyguard was, you guessed it, another shitty OC - a kitsune that shoots out explosions. The hostage exchange (which took place at a supermarket in plain sight of all places) went sour so I pushed a shopping cart into the other party. Then my kitsune recommended we do ""the thing"", so we both transformed into balls of light and zipped around the supermarket, accomplishing jack shit. A guy from the other party then shot the kitsune, so I fucking dropkicked him and caused an explosion big enough to kill all of us. All the while I was keenly aware that I was my cringy, goosestepping OC who measures the skulls of her love interests, and I loved every moment of it.

0.0,as6wcw,0.0,1.0,"I've had a handful of lucid dreams after this particular one (or instances where I almost became lucid), but I wanted to share my first ever lucid dream since it was probably the most vivid one I've ever had! I had it about 2-3 years ago but I can't ever forget it.

The dream began with me and my sister in a dark, shallow grotto with a ton of blue, fluorescent flowers and fungi (think like Avatar, but much smaller and at night). We were both floating on a pond belly-up when a small dogfish/shark began to approach us. Somehow, when the shark lightly grazed my back, I was able to tell myself that I was dreaming (I used to have dreams of giant sharks often as a kid; I'm not scared of them irl but for some reason in the dream world they always induced some fear/anxiety in me).

Immediately once I realized I was dreaming, I became the most lucid I've ever been. I was transported from the grotto into my bedroom. It was cloudy outside so my room was dimly lit. My room was normal for the most part, except for the fact there were little quirky objects on my desk/dresser/various surfaces that I was able to examine in vivid detail. One particular object I remember was a palm-sized Mario mushroom that lightly bobbed back-and-forth. I also saw a few fluorescent mushrooms from the grotto I had been in earlier. When I looked out my bedroom window, I realized that it was not only cloudy, but there was a tiny storm that only manifested in my backyard. The storm-cloud had lighting shooting from it, and directly below there was an amalgamation of working traffic lights whose cables had become all tangled up into a giant mass. I spent a good portion of my dream turning my head away from the window and looking back, as every time I did so, the configuration of the traffic lights in the mass would reassemble into a different configuration.

Finally, once I got bored with this, I ventured into my closet where I was transported into a forest (looking very similar to the grotto from earlier). This time, I was watching myself from the third person and, instead of being myself, I had become my rogue elf character from World of Warcraft.

This demon thing kept popping up and scaring the shit out of me, my entire dream consisted of constant jump scares lol. BUT this thing would kill me every time and I would just come back in a different part of the building.

I woke up from a nap and when I came out of my bedroom I was so sleepy that I was having trouble opening my eyes and waking up. 

When I turned around to look at the kitchen everything in the apartment wasnt right. It was a long hallway that had rooms lined down it. Gypsy (my cat) was in the kitchen with me and I picked her up to bring her back to the room. She isnt allowed into the rest of the apartment. 

When I had turned around my room had disappeared. I started looking around and saying over and over ""Something isn't right, this is a dream and I need to wake up"" I felt the panic and anxiety as I looked around. 

I looked down the hallway and this man kept peeking around the doors and looking at me. Every time I blinked he was a room closer. Once he got to the last room I blinked again and he was in the room with me crawling closer to me and saying over and over ""I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to do it!"" I wanted to run away but I couldn't. He ended up on me and in my face yelling it. His face showed so much pain and anguish as he repeated himself. 

I kept telling myself to wake up but I couldn't. So I ran down stairs of the apartments where I saw my neighbors downstairs trying to sneak 3 black and white billy goats into their apartment.

That's where it ended from the phone call I received from my mother. I'm not really sure if I should be happy she called since I couldn't wake myself up but I am very intrigued of where it would have went from the 3 Billy Goats. I also don't know if the goats should be kind of comical after such intense things happened in the apartment or if it has a deeper meaning.

I was on Christmas break from college and at home. I woke up from an extremely vivid dream of a classmate and I listing different survival-like items in order. This seemed so strange to me because 1.) I am in an education program at my university in which the majority of our classes take place in the same room. i have never seen the room before. 2.) The classmate I was working with was not one that I usually work on classwork/projects with or even really speak to. 3.) We were in no way doing work related to my field of study and it was a quite odd assignment anyway. I brushed the dream off and thought it was probably just me still stressing over the past semester and having a hard time relaxing on break. Well, the current semester started in January. I have a class that takes place in a classroom that my class has never been in. We were handed a worksheet and it is about a person who is stranded on the moon. The task is to list his 15 items in order of importance. There were quite a few people missing today so I was paired with the girl from the dream. I had not thought of my dream at this point. We start the assignment and suddenly there is about a minute of conversation and action and even seating in the room in which I was immediately transported back to my dream! It was the exact same list of items and the exact same classmate with the conversation being the same! Throughout the minute I felt distant and out-of-body. I almost felt a little sick. I know that dreaming of events and then the occurrence of the event happening is nothing new but this one seemed so odd as it didn't really serve a purpose. I have heard of many others have dreams which prevent deaths or car crashes. But, this one was not an event that needed to be stopped or warned about. I'm just wondering if anyone else has had some ""pointless"" premonitions. Also, is there any theories for this? Even crazy ones would help lol.

In my dream, I was at a gas station close to my home. Out of nowhere, one of my bosses from work comes along. This is unusual because 1. my home and work are relatively far apart (about 30 minutes), and 2. she ""outranks"" me by two ranks and doesn't work directly with me.

I had just finished filling up my car and was about to get into it, but this woman somehow opened up the car's driver side door and sat in the driver's seat. Not wanting to let her just take off with my car, I sat in the rear seat on the right. Even within my dream, I thought it was strange how she somehow had a key to start my car.

She began to drive to an unknown destination. I'm on good terms with her, but I didn't appreciate my car being stolen. I began threatening to call the police and saying that she would also be charged with kidnapping a minor. For some reason, my sister (whom I rarely see) was seated in the rear left of the car.

Well, in this one, I dreamed that I was on my way to some kind of high-risk gynecologist. It wasn’t for pregnancy, but some kind of operation. I know it was important because my whole family came. My fiancé and I was in one car, and my (divorced) parents were in another car, along with my sister. 

I remember this place was in a big city. When we got in there, it was EXTREMELY fancy. Glass elevators, two massive wooden spiral staircases. It resembled a really nice hotel. In fact, the only part that resembled anything medical at all was the actual operating rooms. 

So, I go and get whatever operation done, and they dismiss me and tell me to go back to the waiting room. On my way out, I hear what sounds like a male screaming a couple rooms down. 

I go to investigate, and find an empty room. In the corner, there’s a couple shreds of skin tied up in a hair band. Not sure what that meant, but for some reason, Dream Me didn’t think it was very notable. 

When I go to return to the waiting room, I notice that it’s now dark outside and I can’t find any other people at all. This place was booming with life before my operation, so I remember being very confused. 

Anyway, I then notice that police are SURROUNDING the building. They were yelling for me. I didn’t know what they wanted with me, but I was scared anyway, so I hid from them.

Turns out the witch is also a very wealthy business tycoon. She owns this human toy network/building  where every floor is different type of channel. Cooking with toys, styling with toys, dancing with toys... you get the idea. 

So I sneak into my old building, into the witch’s house. Trying to find some sort of spell or item that will change me back.

I confront her and begin to attack her. She fights back then captures 3 people ties them to a giant float eh has rented for the party. and I have rescue them. She flees. The float begins to fly away with the people attached. 

Remember I’m just a yellow teddy bear. I weigh nothing. I can’t help these people. But I try! I’m failing until finally the crowd from the party helps. We rescue everyone. We save the day. My love interest finds me and kisses me. All is well except...

I don’t exactly recall what yelled at her but I do know I ran out of the house and ended up near the road to get to my school.

I know the way from the School to my house, I know which path to take but I do not know the names of the roads. So as I was walking I made eye contact with a lady, she had tanned skin, black hair, wearing a knitted jacket, and was wearing a red beanie. Since we made eye contact I said hi, she decide not to stop at that simple “Hi” and walk to me to continue the conversation. I know I am short and have a slight baby fat so I pretended to be a child because I noticed she had a car. When I said I was walking home, she looked behind me and ran back to her car. I turned around.

A guy with a colourful knitted hat, a black jacket, looked around his mid-20s and I think he had red hair with stubble on his face. (From the beginning of the conversation I had with the lady it was night) He gave me a creepy smile and started walking towards me, I turned back and saw the lady was nowhere near me. The Creep was now to walking closer and I saw another man behind the Creep. I screamed “ PEDO! IT'S-A DAMN PEDO! ‘ELLP!” the man looks at me then the Creep a fled as if *his* life depended on it. Creep is now trying to trap me but I was struggling because my life did depend on it. 

I got out of his grasp and ran, I turned around Creep was still chasing me. I was frightened. I ran and ran but he never gave up, he kept chasing me. He wouldn’t stop. I was now near the road that leads downtown, I look back one more time. He was still there, giving me a smile that was telling me I could never escape him, that he would evenly get me. I took a gamble and ran out on the road to get on the divider they have between the roads. I took one last look behind me he wasn’t chasing me but standing there, smiling creepily. I ran to the next divider and spotted that parts of the divider were very tall and I could climb up to them with the Pylons. I climbed up and saw another person there, he was my classmate. (Let’s call him RUU) RUU was sitting there and I yell “ YO RUU WHAT’s UP? I’M CURRENTLY SCARED SHITLESS!” I then laughed. He responded he just ran away from his house.

Soon, I saw a bunch of other kids coming to the same location as us. We chatted a bit but from the corner of my eye, I saw 2 Adults. One a female, she also was tanned but with longer hair tied into a ponytail. The other a male who was very tall, I didn’t see his face but he was wearing a black dress shirt. The female said she would help us and said we didn’t need to use the point system, I didn’t understand. 

We were then taken to a room with 5 doors, one was purple with the letter DL or something. We opened the door and I woke up under my blanket. I was slightly scared of the Pedo part of the dream. And *HOLY*  this is long.",new,I kinda weird dream I had,1.0

So the thing about my dreams is that they pretty much flow together and even if it’s a different dream, I somehow make them connected. But I can’t remember much about what came before or after, I can remember the “feeling” of them, if that makes sense. Bare with me please! 

So the part that I can’t stop thinking about is when I was just laying down on this thing (don’t think it was a bed) with my friend. This guy comes in and I know he’s my boyfriend (mind you I’m lonely af and do not have a boyfriend). So he walks over and my friend goes “where have you been, your girl is super in the mood right now” and I’m like yes hello, love me! He said “are you sure?” And my friend says “yes, feel how wet she is”. I just happened to be wearing a skirt so he goes to feel my underwear and he was like “damn, you are really wet”. And I knewww I was wet, like a girl was drenched, a whole ass ocean. Anyway so obviously he gets in the mood too and my friend was like I’ll leave you guys alone, and leaves the room but the thing is that there wasn’t a door really, it was this piece of wall that wouldn’t close all the way so it was open a good foot. My mother was showering in the next room and someone was outside the room we were in so we couldn’t be loud. So we start making out and at first I was scared our kisses were being loud (call me paranoid) but then I started relaxing and he was rubbing my kitty, ya girl was livinnnn. But literally that was it. We just made out and he was pleasuring me. And then we magically end up at a concert, but that’s for another time. 

Now I know it prolly isn’t the most exciting to y’all, but how it felt was a different story. I felt love and romance and all those goodie feelings one must get when they are in a relationship. I feel like this dream reflected my desire to be in a relationship because I do, really badly.

It all started when I was standing in the main part of the church during a normal mass with my dad. There weren’t that many people there, and I didn’t recognize anyone except for my dad who was standing next to me. The church was also dimly lit  and seemed smaller than I remember it being. I saw the priest talk, although I couldn’t hear what he was saying. As I am trying to figure out what he is saying, he walks off he altar and stands there staring at us. Then, he starts walking and everyone starts following him down to the basement. The basement was really different from how I remembered it in real life.
 (I should also mention that I did not have any sense of fear or worry in this part of the church). As we walk down the stairs to the basement, a sense of fear comes over me, as though something was watching me. My dad was walking beside me, but he was silent. As I get closer to the basement floor, everyone disappears out of nowhere and it is just me and my dad down there. I see that all the carpet and the walls are mouldy , there are cracks in the walls and all the rooms had their doors open. The rooms were dark, and looked abandoned and run down. The basement was really dimly litany I felt like someone was watching me and was about to attack me. As I am about to go into one of the rooms, I hear my dad’s voice say “Quit”. I stood between the doorway for a few seconds, and my heart starts beating rapidly, with this fear getting stronger and stronger. Then I jolted awake.

So I just had this dream where these aliens invaded and there were these bug type creatures that were everywhere that would kill you and basically I don’t know why but you couldn’t leave your house or you’d die, and you couldn’t help other people aside from who’s in your house. I remember my best friends dying, and I was devastated. At some point I remember dying?? And going to heaven?? And I saw my friend there. I also remember talking to what I think was an angel and we were I think arguing? And I think he was saying something along the lines of “why’d you wanna leave? It’s heaven”. And to which I replied “no one who’s dead WANTS to be dead. It doesn’t matter if you’re in heaven, you would still wish you were alive. I don’t want to be dead right now, I want to live the rest of my life and die when I’m like 80” And so the angel let me go back down to earth to see my mom, and then going back to heaven. After the third time of doing this the angel said “you can only do this one more time, if you do it again you won’t be able to return to heaven, you’ll have to go to hell instead.” And I remember I didn’t listen, so when I was done visiting earth this demon showed up and was like “alright let’s go” so I cooperated. I also remember the demon being surprisingly gentle with me, like he wasn’t being mean or anything. So when I got to hell I remember it being like I was in school, and I had to complete a test with infinite questions. Which would be a perfect description of hell for me, except my friend??? Was there??? I don’t know why, I think she did the same thing I did where she visited earth too many times. So when we were there I don’t remember if there were other people in the classroom or if it was just us, but I remember us knowing that we were being watched but still talking to each other in whispers and trying to make each other laugh. I remember very clearly she passed me a note that said “hit or miss” and I erupted in a fit of giggles, and a demon- one different from the one that took me to hell- showed up and took the paper and said “what is this? ‘Hit or miss’?” And I remember smiling widely and saying “I guess they never miss huh” and me and my friend both burst out laughing. That was when I woke up. Honestly the vibe that I got was “hell wouldn’t be too bad with my friend here” although I probably shouldn’t have. Thoughts?

And I've been watching and reading a lot of advice for lucid dreams, but last night my mind took a very very interesting tactic at extending my lucid dreams. Here's what happened:

I was having some very action packed lucid dreams, and then I'd quickly go into a non-lucid dream, realize I was dreaming and keep the cycle going. So my mind somehow knew that I'd quickly lose the fresh lucidity, put me in a different non-lucid dream and then become lucid again.

And even though dreams are subconscious, it was like I was subconsciously aware that I had to keep this cycle going to experience fresh lucidity everything. This is how I know I was subconsciously doing this, and it's insane. After one of my moments of lucidity, I was transported into another non-lucid dream where I was in a group therapy session for lucid dreamers. The leader of the group was talking about how in our lucid dreams, we must convince ourselves that we are not in a dream to keep the realism of the dream landscape fresh. Which is exactly what my mind was doing. And then we chanted, ""Dreams [that are non-lucid] are what keep our reality grounded! Dreams are what keep our reality grounded!""
And it's so INSANE to me that I didn't know I was dreaming in the group session, but somehow my sub-subconscious knew that I was. And it was true, the fact that I was dreaming [non-lucid] was what kept the dreamscape ""reality"" grounded. The fact that I was chanting this in a dream is what blows my mind.

No matter how much I went, my bladder was never satisfied (luckily I didn't pee in real life lol). Because everyone took too long, we got attacked by the bad guys. At first, it was only some innocent-looking boys from our team attacking and fighting with some girls from out team (because apparently the girls and boys shared the bathroom). But soon after the ""bathroom bar brawl"" had started, the door slammed open, and I realized we were in big trouble.

Some bad guys who looked like spy movie henchmen burst into the room. I had a gun, and started shooting at them as I ran. They lost track of me in favor of other people. I found a tiny dog, who trusted me. The bad guys came after me again. I shot at them. Despite the fact that they were shooting me, none of their bullets were hurting me. I ran, and found the dog again. I picked it up, and when a gem on it's forehead was revealed, I realized it was a robotic decoy -whose actions I could flawlessly control with my mind. ""This could be useful,"" I thought. I stuffed the decoy into my bag, and soon found the real dog.

Anyway, we all managed to escape, dog included. We looked at the electronic map, which consisted of mountains to the east, a big forest to the west and a field northwest of both. (We were in the mountains.) We were trying to figure out where to go next to reach the field, when I spotted the picture for Sebastian from Stardew Valley at a train station that was occupied by the enemy.

I remember Joey playfully punching the other in the gut as they talked about something vague, I can't remember the specifics but it sure was funny. 

Next thing, I'm in this strangely large diner, I'm sitting in the inner part of the booth, the table takes up most of the room, the bench is one of those long wall benches that have a ninety degree angle at the corner. Across from me in the stools, sits Joey and the guy but they are just drinking coffee. To my right, is the Blonde Girl I've been seeing and even being in my dreams, this is the third time I seen here, I know it's her because she doesn't ever look at me, she doesn't talk, she is also my age, if not younger by a year. I see her and think, ""Why is she here? Why am I in my shoes this time?"" Last time, I dreamt in her shoes, was strangled in her shoes, I felt her body as my own and it was absolutely disturbing ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/alf8y3/craziest\_dream\_ive\_had\_in\_my\_life\_im\_perplexed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/alf8y3/craziest_dream_ive_had_in_my_life_im_perplexed/)) And the other time I dreamt in her shoes, she was in some Space Station ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/aj0ft2/dream\_of\_being\_a\_girl\_in\_some\_weird\_ssp\_type/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/aj0ft2/dream_of_being_a_girl_in_some_weird_ssp_type/)) these are the only dreams I've been in this girl's shoes, I know it's her because she has straight blonde hair, kinda long, she's a little shorter than me, not a large chest, not as skinny as me either (I lost 70lbs in the passed year, I'm dangerously underweight.) 

Anyway, I'm looking at her as she's writing down things in some pad of paper, she says she's going to do something but I hear nothing, all I hear really is quiet diner music, light chatter, and footsteps. She walks away and another blonde girl comes and sits down, she is visibly different and not someone I recognize, she's older and a bit wider, what's weird is I think I wasn't even sitting in this booth in the dream, like my sight as just from this position like an invisible camera. As we all know about Diners, the bench seat is always unnecessarily close to the table, she does the shimmy walk in between the bench and table right past me, like I wasn't even sitting there. Weird thing is, I didn't pay any attention to her or anything, I just kept looking in the direction outside the booth, she sits down and the Dream Girl comes back, sits down, and next thing I know the other girl starts bullying Dream Girl verbally, I don't remember specifics again but I know that Dream Girl seemed a bit insulted and looks in my direction (at the other girl) and I see her blue eyes, crisp and clear as the Maldives, I really do think she's beautiful of course, but here's what's weird. People that dream of individuals sometimes feel this emotion of unconditional love, or something along those lines. I'm not feeling that, I'm feeling nothing, because I am just a witness and not actually dreaming of sitting in the booth. I am solely visualizing all this. What's weird about this, is the fact that in my other dreams, I was HER and not ME, in the Space Dream I saw her from a camera-style view before entering her shoes, that's how I know what she looks like.

Is this girl real or just some strange reoccurring anomaly in my dreams? Should I seek her out or just consider it another dream amongst dreams? The reason I'm on the fence is because reoccurring dream characters are USUALLY people I know in my life, friends, acquaintances, bullies, family, and even celebrities, but I don't know who this blonde girl is and this is my third time dreaming of her.

0.0,arwb3u,1.0,2.0,"I remember quite vaguely now but it was kind of really clear during it. It took me until I came back in my body just before waking up before I was convinced that I just had more than a semi-awaken dream. It lasted around 2 hours from 3 am to 5 am

It began as I knew that I would have trouble falling asleep because I felt my mind active. Then I felt like a mild numbing in my body, giving me the impression I was leaving it. But my thoughts were just wandering around I wasn't focusing on anything. I was just like lol imagine I'm about to leave my body to go to the astral realm. But I think it definitely happened but differently than what I would have expected an astral trip would feel like. I didn't have like clear vision of my surroundings as I was going through dimensions and vivid sensations from where my spirit was. In fact, I was still very aware of my real body but I felt it was sleeping even if my consciousness was living another experience than sleep. Idk how or why but I knew that if I tried to move abruptly or quickly get up to check my bedroom or go to the bathroom, I wouldn't feel well at all and something bad would probably happen.

So after that numbing/vibrating sensation, I felt that I was pulled and lifted. Then began scary thoughts to emerge. I was imagining demons and creatures that I knew from my childhood and even early past (because yeah I'm still at least impressed and shook by monsters at my twenties) that scared me in movies and images or badtrips/psychosic episodes I had on drugs. I kind of felt their presence in my bedrooms and around me and my body. Heavy shivering were going down my body at some point but I felt confident that nothing could harm me and that trust in my safety remained the entirety of the experience.

After a moment of being surrounded by creatures I think I met a sort of fear master like Lucifer or Death itself and I started communicating with him (I remember a masculine energy). He growled powerfully like a death metal beast and I found it interesting. Something he was repeating for a while stuck with me : ""The path to the stars and Sun"". I had some mild visions that illustrated this as I was just imagining the stuff.

And at some point, after lots of psychedelic imagery came through my thoughts, I met my biological mother, who I don't get to see often. It was like a natural encounter, unplanned but lucid, as if we kind of knew where we were, enjoying the opportunity.  We began a short but profound and significant conversation about out relationship and life in general during which I recalled a dream I had some months ago with her again and the same ""mindset"" we had at that moment — it's funny because when I told her about that old dream (irl) she said that maybe we were  close astral friends. I dropped a couple tears.

After that, there's not much I remember but I can tell that I came back the opposite way I left. I had that numbing sensation as I felt I was re-entering my body and creatures and malicious entities were all around the place. They were exactly like those we see in sacry movies like the circle and ""rage meurtrière"" in French. But there was no fear. It was like it tempted it's way in but there was just cautious respect and curiosity. Once I felt like there was a childish being that wanted to play running across and around my bed. And then, I woke up, fully there with the same impression as I just came out of a regular dream. I was a bit anxious of course because I'm a bit of a pussy but I wasn't the only one. I went to my living room trying not to let my imagination shape in the dark those creatures I just saw and there was Paneton, one my two cats, scared as  f u c k. I've never seen a cat's tail that fucking big. But he's ok now. The other seemed really chill. She's older.

So yeah it's been an hour and a half since I woke up. I'm gonna head back to bed and try to get more complete sleep.

If there is anyone experienced with astral travel, has any knowledge on the subject or could interprete and/or explain what happenned, I'd be really interested in what you think about it.

0.0,arw4tz,2.0,1.0,"I had a really strange and emotional dream last night. Apparently, I joined the Yakuza.

It started out when I was in a room, visibly worried. Something broke and I couldn't afford to repair or replace it. I don't know what it was anymore.

A thin man in a white suit came to me. ""If you join the Yakuza they will pay to fix all your problems..."", the man said.

""What's the catch?"" I asked. ""You will be asked to do something in return in the future"".  ""Ok let's do it!"".

Next day, whatever it was, it was repaired. I had a paid invoice in my hands. I was sitting on the couch in the living room together with my mother once the bell rang. I opened the door and there stood a more fat looking Japanese guy who greeted me like I was some close family. ""Hey Peter how you're doing my friend?!"". ""Uhm, fine I guess?!"".

Then he just walked in my house, helped himself to coffee and snacks as he sat down on the couch, a little too close to me. He almost sat on my lap and my mother was like looking at him like wtf. The man said: ""Listen you gotta do something for me,"", while he was handing me a brown envelope with a case file in it. ""Make sure you're ready.""

He then went outside again. ""Who the hell was that?"" my mother asked. ""Oh just a new business partner,"" I said.

I went upstairs, scared as hell, opened the envelope and inside was a picture of an Asian looking guy along with a description:

""This man is a big threat to the Yakuza, he has killed many of our men and threatens our families. Kill him as soon as you can"".

""WOW,"" I thought. ""Killing a man goes way too far! Besides, how do I even get to this guy"". Yet, for some reason, I felt angry while reading the text on the case file.

2 nights passed (in the dream) and I barely slept. I was paranoid as hell from the fact that people just showed up at my house. That night it was a hit again. I heard a weird vehicle stop in front of my house. It was a horse and carriage. A man stepped out and knocked on my door in the middle of the night. I opened up and he said are you done with the murder yet. I said no it's not as easy as it looks because it's on the other side of the planet. Then he offered me to pay for the plane ticket. I said how am I even going to do this without getting caught. He only said: Don't keep us waiting.

I then went back to my room and start to think about how to kill someone without getting caught. I then figured I could best make a robot do it for me. My mother woke up and asked me if everything was alright.

""Yes, everything is fine"".

""You know, there are other ways of making money without joining a gang, you know that right?"" my mother asked.

For some reason, I felt emotional for her saying that. I said: ""Ok, let's say, hypothetically, that I may be involved in a gang, how would you get out?"".

I don't know her answer anymore, but it was something really cool, almost poetic. If I remember again I'll add it here.

0.0,arvszk,0.0,3.0,"So I never really have dreams I remember. As in per year I have less than 5 dreams I even slightly recall. And the majority were sexual until I started NoFap and desexualized everything in my life. But I just woke up sweating and in pain from the most intense dream ever. For context, my (now ex) girlfriend just dumped me Friday night (3rd night since then). It was peaceful and I have nothing bad to say and hold out hope we actually can be friends, but the fact I miss her is on my mind. I just finished packing her things I will leave on her porch with a closure note in it, something I poured a lot into right before falling asleep. 

Anyway here is the dream: so I am at a hospital in the outskirts of LA. I live in NJ and have never been close to California. I don't know what prompts it, but I visit an area and am asked if I want ""human dinner."" And I oblige and say yes. So I'm in a cubicle where you can see through the bottom, but there are 4 walls. So I can see feet, and hear things, and that is when my ""waiter"" comes up. It turns out to be one of my bosses. Really cool guy, kind of unexpected, but I know him. I didn't see his face just his feet and a menu. 

The menu consisted of an appetizer, main meat and dessert. All presumably made from human. The main meat if I am remember correctly, they asked me who and I think I was shy and answered whatever. Then a strange thing happens: my dream goes out of sequence. Never in my life of remembering the few dreams has that ever happened. 

My mind went to 3 memories from within this dream: the first that the meat tasted really good and a certain way they had it cooked and I even recall bringing leftovers home. That is when it hit me: that memory felt real, because I dreamed about this same dinner before. I remember eating and bringing home this meat. Tasted great. 

And the 2nd thought, which was new: this place would be where you could do a program where they inject you with some sort of freezing agent and kill you. Within minutes. And then serve you as the meat. Again, this is familiar with this dream I must have had about this stuff years ago. That feeling was too real.

The 3rd memory is not related to any dream I had; it is that my ex is there. She says her mental health is so bad (she actually is recovering from a mental illness currently irl, best of luck to her) and she is ready to die in this program I was not expecting her to be at this hospital. I wish her luck and say I hope I get to eat you, in the most genuine and proud of her-way possible. Like legit I am in my boyfriend supportive mode and thinking she is doing something best for her. As sick as it sounds that feeling was a similar feeling I'm having right now of moving on and closure, and seeing her do what is best for herself, and it is apparently that in this demented dream. 

So I snap back to the main dream (again, so odd since I have never had a memory or gone out if order in a dream. Sidetracked yes but never a full on train of thought to fill in blanks and then return to the dream). This is where it gets intense. It hits me then omg, we are eating people. Yeah my ex is one. This is messed up. So I quickly open my wallet and see 4 $100 bills (the most unrealistic thing in this dream). I throw one or two on the ground hoping that my meal i ordered is at least partially paid for, in the hope they don't pursue me, as I escape. I bust through one of the walls on my cubicle and find a nearby door and just start running. I keep looking back to see if I am being pursued. 

I might be but don't see anyone. But since I am a runner irl, in this dream I run. Through yards, windy roads, woods, etc. All unfamiliar territory that looks more like a generic windows background than any experience of mine. But I went at a really good pace and zig zagged enough they never found me. 

Then I tried calling the LAPD. I was put on hold for 20 minutes, and started having to run and fight off generic people from this place as I was on a phone. Not many details in that part of the dream. Then I see my family who is just so nonchalant. I beg my Dad to try calling the LAPD too and try to get through. He is and I'm escorting and protecting him as he does. He doesn't get through either. So I desperately plead with my mother to call the California Attorney General. No wait, even better, the New Mexico state police (I showed interest in being a trooper there at one point that's why that is in my mind). She is stubborn and eventually does and they pick up and go to the place, arrest people involved (no one i recognized), and all is well.

Until I get two feelings: one of guilt since I worry they may ask me if I ever ate human before and I did in an older dream. I feel so much guilt and worry about jail for life I decide to hold onto that secret and that hurts to do. The other is...idk. happiness because my ex comes up and hugs me and tells me she escaped.

It ends there with me not having a phone charging and being hailed as a hero so someone fetches me a phone charger. 

**So here are my thoughts and analysis. Probably junk so you can put your own in the comments**

Firstly I have no desire to eat human ever. It is just perplexing i had 2 dreams about this now. I also would never wish death upon my ex. She ended it nice and is a good person. No bad feelings towards her, so why my mind went here I have no clue. 

So overall I think the dream being extremely detailed yet jumping through different times is because of how my mind is right now. Trying to reconcile why she broke up with me, and trying to make insane detailed plans about the future and worrying about everything.

The only other things I can pick out are the parents not caring. My parents love and care so much irl. They are just ignorant to mental health (I have no issues, my ex had many). Desoite their best efforts, they just didn't get it and did not know what to say and how to process what she is dealing with. So maybe that was imagery to that. 

Otherwise I really don't know what anything in this dream means, if there is symbolism. All I know is that I miss my ex big time as I process this break up. So my mind is racing. Hopefully this is the last horrifying dream i have with her in it. Not helping me move on brain 🙄",new,Cannibalism and my ex,3.0

At first I was in what I assume was an apartment  complex parking lot on a bike.(live in a few apartments growing up) I straddled the bike & had my feet on the ground as I was backing up. Then I bump into her & we said ohh hey!

all of a sudden I’m in a school gym watching a talent show about 3 acts. One in particular was a little black kid who was singing & it sounded PHENOMENAL. I went up to congratulate & compliment him. Him & I walked to the side & on a couch was my crush. She was laying on it & had crutches. I said something to her & she said we had broken up & she said that I told her I wanted to be friends. I was confused so I just put one arm around her & held her hand with the other.

Then we were at a high school walking to class & she still had the crutches. Which I was confused about but never questioned. I had never seen her with crutches at any point in real life.

Anyways earlier tonight with a friend I told him about this dream. He had told me that there was a young black kid who sang & won a talent show at his college campus. It tripped us both out lol.

If it is a universal sign then maybe her crutches means shes hurt emotionally maybe? Like sad/depressed & when I was with her in the dream she was very happy the whole time.

Onto the dream.

&#x200B;

I am usually a good driver IRL. However in this dream I was not. I was behind this tow-truck at a light that just turned red. I seen it turn red but the truck ahead of me made a left turn anyways and despite this, I followed. The other guy went through the red light fine but I didn't. I was lightly tapped by another car, another car slowed and got hit another car was in the wrong place and got hit, etc. I caused a huge traffic jam but apparently the jam kept going and the more cars that came onto the road the bigger the jam was. I remember it all being light taps but enough to have a lot of damage to the cars with no injuries.

When we finally stopped I frantically call my mom. I remember trying to remember her phone number to call instead of going into my contacts. Finally she picked up and came. My Dad somehow found out and came as well. A few people huddled in a ditch (Way less people than were actually hit) and we started talking. For some reason my dad came with a pet chicken. (???). They all started talking about who was the person at fault and came up with their own clues. When a police officer came by he asked what we all found out. I was in this crowd but I didn't say a word. The Officer started listing different things for people it could NOT be. For some reason the first one said was ""Doesn't own a chicken."" The police officer looked around and the group laughed. My Dad in his real nature had a smile on his face and went to pick up his chicken and pet it, the group laughed some more.

Then things started pointing towards me being at fault. That's when my dad pretended to go crazy. He started to call the police officer names and even though me around. I remember mouthing ""more more"" because there was thousands of dollars of damage up the road he didn't know about and he mouthed ""There is more"" he continued to throw me around and make sure I wasn't getting hurt to look like the bad guy so he could take the fall.

I know it was a somewhat reoccurring dream but now that I remember it I feel like I haven't had it again.

So in this dream I'm on a cruise, yet my ""cabin"" within the cruise is something like a trailer/modular home outside but still somehow within the ship. All of a sudden I notice an infestation of bees or wasps in the ceiling of this trailer that is my cabin so I go to some sort of help desk to complain. How I transition from this seemingly outdoor trailer ""cabin"" into the public part of the ship isn't clear.

Somehow that part of the dream ends and the next thing I know I'm over at my dad's buddy's place for dinner with my dad and someone else I didn't recognize, and perhaps there are a few other people there. I also don't recognize the place but feel like, at least in the context of the dream, it belonged to his friend. This friend of my dad's is quite particular about certain things so some things obviously set him off. One thing that I think would do just that is exactly what I did in the dream; he came in with some grocery bags and for some reasons I started to go through them! As I'm doing this my dad's buddy is laughing with my dad and my dad getting upset with me. I ask him why he's getting mad even though I know why. In reality I would have never gone through this guy's grocery bags, let alone likely have an opportunity to go to his place for dinner.

In this dream I'm upset that I left my phone on the cruise (apparently the places tied in even though transitioning is unclear, or I just told this part to my friend for a laugh but I don't think so) as I was expecting the reply text of the friend whose actual text in reality ended up waking me.

Despite the fact that I'm legally blind and that my dreams usually reflect this, these apocalyptic dreams have always been very vivid, with sharp images and clear colors (my vision used to be better, which is why I can judge this).

I'd like to tell you guys about a few of them that I remember.

- The first one I can remember: My wife and I sit in an apartment (presumably our home) in Seoul. In real life she actually comes from South Korea but we don't live there. In the dream we have a child, which we don't actually have in real life. My wife and I are extremely worried about our child, which is very sick. We should probably go to the doctor but for some reason we really don't want to go outside. In the dream I don't understand why we are so terrified of the outside but somehow it seems to make sense to us. Eventually we can't watch our child suffer any longer and we decide to go to the big hospital (Yonsei University Hospital). We choose to leave our child at home and get some medicine. As we walk through the streets, everything is completely silent and empty. No cars, no pedestrians... nothing. We get more scared. Finally, we reach the hospital. To our confusion, there are lots of people lining up in front of it. However, they all seem very sick. Some are lying on the ground. My wife and I walk past the line. A young woman passes by with a cute baby in her arms. She looks very worried. I want to pet the baby because it looks so cute but as I reach out my hand, the mother looks me directly in the eyes and says in a very firm tone: ""DON'T"". Then she quickly walks off. For a moment I get sulky because I think she didn't trust me to be sweet to her baby... until I realize it might have been a warning. My wife and I then go inside the hospital. There's tons of stuff lying around on the floor; everything looks very chaotic. The lights flicker or don't work at all. We turn into a long hallway. Suddenly we hear people run after us and my wife whispers in my ear: ""RUN!"" Then I wake up.

- I am living in some sort of hippie community and things are pretty okay. Then, one day, we get attacked by a huge gang. They are all heavily armed and pretty much shooting up the village. I hide behind a corner and see women and children being massacred in the streets. A friend leads me to a hidden basement. The room is filled with all kinds of weapons and tons of ammo. In real life, I've never held a gun, so I'm rather shocked. I ask him what the hell this is. He ominously replies: ""You know what it is. The time has come. We need to defend ourselves... our brothers and sisters around the world are doing the same."" The dream then goes on for a bit but that's not so important.

- The next one I remember is very short. I am sitting up on a deer stand, at the edge of a forest. Next to me sits a boy. I don't know this boy in real life but in the dream we seem to be friends (or maybe he's my son?) It is raining but we are protected by a wooden roof. For some reason, I am absolutely terrified of the rain. I don't know if it's the rain itself that is dangerous or something that is being done because of it (maybe a flood) or perhaps creatures that are being attracted by the rain... all I know is that I am so so scared. The boy asks me if we'll be able to go home and I simply tell him no. Then I wake up.

- Just a few days ago I dreamt about global, nuclear war. It starts with me desperately running through the neighborhood of an unknown town trying to find my wife. I know that only a few minutes remain until atomic bombs will drop on our city. There are lots of other people running around too. Finally I find her and we run to a secret bunker together. Just split seconds after we manage to close the heavy door, the nuclear bombs explode outside. There is a window and we can see everything happen. There are a few other people in the bunker and somehow we know that we are literally the only survivors... possibly in the whole world. Then we realize that even though we are protected from the bombs and the nuclear fallout, we will probably die because we don't have enough food and water to survive for very long.

- Finally, just last night I had probably the most disturbing of all of these dreams. In the dream, I was at a beach with a bunch of other guys. They seemed to be my friends. It was very hot and the sun was shining down from a cloudless, deep-blue sky. For a while we were doing just regular vacation stuff... talking, looking after the girls, fooling around etc. After a while my friends tell me that they want to go surfing and ask me whether I want to join them. I feel lazy and so I reply that I'd rather stay back and take a nap. They cheerfully run off while I get comfortable on our beach chair, next to the cooling box with the beer and under the parasol. I quickly fall asleep. Then, suddenly, I am awoken to people yelling my name. I open my eyes and see my friends run towards me from the sea (about 50 yards away). They aren't cheerful anymore though. They seem very scared. I notice that the air has suddenly become MUCH colder. I look around more and notice that the entire beach is completely empty. Everyone has left. A significant wind has picked up. I get up and walk towards my friends. As they reach me, they all talk over each other. Everyone is saying ""let's go!!!"" and ""c'mon!!"". I ask one of them what the hell is going on. Instead of giving me an answer, he simply points to the sky. I look up and I see a gigantic storm building up. But it's not just any storm... it's a truly apocalyptic storm. The sky has discolored to a strange, unnatural fire-red. Mixed into this are black clouds. The wind now becomes very strong and I am freezing. The other guys have already ran to the car. I want to grab our stuff but then I decide against it because I'm worried they will leave me behind. I run to the car too we drive off in a panic. I am sitting in the back and so I have time to look outside during the ride. I can see how trees are being broken by the storm like matches. Then I woke up.

So... this was pretty long but I wonder if anyone else has had dreams like this.

0.0,art5zr,1.0,1.0,"I had an extraordinarily vivid dream of encountering great white sharks in a dream last night. 

I was standing in a small town harbor/marina on a floating dock. The space had the odd quality of feeling staged, kind of like an exhibit in a zoo, with the walls painted with a mountainous landscape and the water under the dock constituting a pool. The ‘room’ of the exhibit was big, however, so big that it only vaguely felt enclosed. The waves of the pool lapped against the sides of the walls and bounced back and forth across the surface, which gave away the enclosure. The pool, however, was deep, perhaps bottomless. The water was black. 

A small fishing boat docked near me. The boat was maybe 25 feet long. There were fisherman in the boat but they weren’t in focus, they were only shadows. Tied up next to the boat was a huge great white shark with black eyes and a bloodied mouth. The shark was as large as the boat. It was tied up along side the boat like the fish in “The Old Man and the Sea” but the shark was still alive, albeit exhausted. In the shark was a giant hook the size of a butcher’s meat hook. The fishermen then moved to haul the shark onto the dock but the shark, seemingly in one last stand, gave out a surprising burst of energy and dragged the fishermen into the pool. The dark pool churned into swirls of red and black water as the waves exponentially increased in height. I remember trying to move up and down with the float dock as it bobbed like a buoy in a hurricane. I soon dropped on the deck to a prone position trying to hold onto the sides with my arms outstretched, my fingers hugging the dock boards. The dock the started to roll with the waves. Soon, the dock started to flip over vertically, and I tried to use my body as a counterweight, but eventually it proved to be too much and so I climbed to sit on top of the edge of the floating dock as it sat 90 degrees in the water. Looking down I could see the grey outline of the shark in the black water, circling, nudging, bumping the dock. I gripping my feet as I tried to stay precariously balanced on that dock. I awoke overcome with the peculiar and particular feeling of being hunted. I know that feeling from playing tag games as a kid, games like ‘lava monster’ on a playground. But this was so intense. It was instilled with awe and terror. The awe was gripping, like the way a thunderstorm grips you in an inspiring way. It was awakening. The shark was truly *awesome.* The terror was horrifying but thrilling as well. I was swept up in a strange and dark intimacy between predator and prey, between fate and chance. There was, all the while, again this feeling that is was all staged. It felt like a dance.

I always loved our family pet, Beau, a golden Labrador retriever. Beau was the friendliest dog, never hurt a soul and never barked. So when he passed, it felt like part of me was gone. But eventually, after about a year, I was able to move on. 

So a few months after Beau passed away, I heard some unfortunate news about my uncle’s chocolate lab, Riley, who had a few cancerous tumors. But that’s pretty much all we heard for months. Nothing about Riley being on her final days, which brings me to the dream

For some background, Beau was always an adventurous dog. At my grandparents’ house, where we would take him often, Beau would sprint through the large lawn and into the wooded pathways of their land. He often would not come back for quite awhile, to the panic of my family. It’s not a surprise that my dream of him took place there. 

Finally, to the dream. I was sitting on a rocking chair on the deck of my grandparents’ house, feeling homesick and dull overall. As I was looking out towards the forest on their land, I saw a figure, like a fox. I heard a sound like clattering keys, which seemed familiar for some reason. Soon, I realized it was Beau. I ran out, tears starting to flow down my face, giving him a huge hug. Finally, I’ve been reunited with my incredible dog after so long. 

Unfortunately the dream didn’t last long, like most good things in life. I woke up and just bawled my eyes out for like a half hour. I checked my phone, and it was a text in the little group chat our family has. It was my uncle. He wrote about how Riley had passed away peacefully in their home. Naturally, I freaked the hell out. I *never* dreamed about my dog before then. Ever. And it was a while after Beau’s passing when the dream occurred, and like I said, I had already moved on from his death. To make it even odder, I put the news about my uncle’s dog having cancer behind me, because it was a while ago and it just didn’t affect me much personally because i’ve barely even seen their dog.

They look completely normal, but something about them assures that they are merely a carcass. The only hope for humanity is us 2, to carry on the species, and somehow I know that at the intersection we will meet. I get there, nervous, and spot a person which I know is human.

The problem is: *We're both guys*(and yes I am a guy IRL) 

At this point every shimmer of hope fades from me. We talk, I can't remember the actual conversation but he says he will just live out the rest of his life normally with everyone else. I think I'll do the same, but first I just wanna think. So I start walking aimlessly, just to clear my head. I spot a parking building with a big hole in it, and look inside. A giant room has been made, from the top floor to the bottom. There are hundreds of cocoons hanging from the ceiling, and somehow I knew that there was a human being inside each one.

This part is very vague and I don't remember anything except me getting angry but having to hide it because the guard would probably arrest/ shoot me. It came to a point where we were both inside a small room, and he has his back turned. I realize the most logical action is to shoot him, and so I do exactly that, thinking that the other guard I would kill as soon as he entered the room. Turns out, even in dreams I don't have good aim with guns and it takes about 3 shots to kill him.

I know that there will be more people entering, so I take a guard as a meat shield, and right as I do so (this part is surely the strangest) I kid you not Samuel L. Jackson himself jumps in dual wielding pistols, shooting at me.

The guard absorbs most of the bullets, but eventually I fall over and I start to feel the bullet impacts. It doesnt hurt, I just feel weakened and my body feels like it is burning.

0.0,arstwj,0.0,1.0,"I had this only a few minutes ago and I am very tense.

What's weird is that this whole thing was observed by me on a laptop in the dream, though the borders would often vanish.

I was out with someone I didn't even know, though he looked a lot like me. We walked for a while and talked about girls, until we reached a lake with rafts.

Reluctantly, I stepped on one, and then two other guys showed up, went in front of the raft and it started to move forward. The raft seperated in two, so I jumped to the one that was closer to the coast.

That didn't help me.

The guy I was out with started to paddle with his legs unnaturally fast. I kept saying ""Hey stop! Slow down!"", but he just laughed and continued.

Then, the raft tilted because of the large force and flipped us in the dark water. The guys were all laughing, but I was terrified, because I can't swim. So I scream: ""Wait! I can't swim!""

The one I hung out with said ""You'll learn from experience"". He said so in visible happiness. Almost as if this was exactly what he wanted.

I tried to swim to the raft, but the guys all pulled it away from me.

Then the real horrors began.

It was like gravity was working sideways. I was being dragged across the surface of the lake until I fell in a hole in the cliffside. It looked like a dungeon (brick walls, chains, dripping water). Part of me was glad to just be out of the water, but I had no idea what was in store for me.

I heard a noise.

My heart started to pound. I told myself to calm down, that my mind was messing with me again, but no it wasn't.

Red symbols flashed in my eyes as another noise struck the halls of the dungeon.

Out of the corner of the hall came a pale blue-skinned man with red eyes, sharp teeth and long white hair and beard, that slowly came towards me.

My heart was out of control. It sounded like a machine gun about to blast a hole in my chest.

I stood for a moment, breathing heavily and shaking. I was waiting for him to dissapear and prove that none of this was real, but dissapear he did not.

He kept getting closer.

I had no other choice. I ran to the exit, but it was like the same force from before was dragging me back.

I found a gun laying on the ground, and a red barrel in the hallway. Video game logic set in and I shot the barrel, resulting in a massive explosion.

I woke up, but Immediatelly fell back asleep which blurred my lines of reality even more.

This dream was about studying people with mental ilnesses through playing board games. All the while it sounded like the doctor was talking about me.

I kept getting up, but falling back into sleep.

The doctor kept mentioning some book called ""Symptoms"". For some reason, whenever they mentioned that word, it scared me more.

I could no longer take it. After I woke up again, I reached for the light, banishing the darkness from the room and my mind.

I was free.

&#x200B;

I have a job as a security guard, and as you may be able to guess, it's pretty damn boring. I worked a lot of mornings and nights, so when I'd go in to work, I'd be the only one there for at least eight hours at a time. Since I was the only one there and rarely anyone showed up to cause trouble, I'd try to catch some z's as much as I could to help pass the time. 

It was always pretty uncomfortable to sleep down there, number one because I could lose my job if I was caught, and number two we only had one chair that was decent enough to sit in, let alone try to sleep in it. This, I believe, always helped put me in that state of mind where the beginning stages of sleep paralysis would go into effect, and I became quite good at knowing when I would actually go under. 

So it was the regular morning shift, right around 7:30 AM, and after having my breakfast, I shut my eyes and tried to make myself as comfortable as possible, and shortly after, it began. I felt myself slip away, and I couldn't move a muscle in my body. This was normal considering I had done it so many times, but I started to notice that it was getting a little weird. I could hear a dog barking outside of the wall of the room, and I know that there aren't any dogs around the area that can get loose. I waited for a few seconds, and then it was like I could feel it outside of the wall, and it was growling. I could feel the anger seeping through the wall of the room, and I started to panic because I had never had that happen to me before. I tried to move, and obviously couldn't, so I had to sit there in fear of what was happening. After trying to mumble and move to break out of it, I felt it come through the wall and it was in the room with me. I closed my eyes and could hear the growling getting closer and closer, and there was nothing I could do about it but sit there and panic. Finally, I broke out of it and got enough strength to get move my arms and legs, and it was gone. 

In past experiences, I've always felt like something was there, but never like this.

**Details about my dreams:**

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had amazing, vivid dreams almost every night without fail. I’ve always been interested in fantasy/sci-fi/apocalyptic adventure and action series, and I’m pretty sure that transferred over to my dreams as a child. I have no dream control whatsoever though, but as the title states, I have the fortune of being able to decide generally what I’m going to dream about beforehand, and if it will be a continuation of a previous dream or not.

My dreams usually take place in areas of the world I’ve seen, been to, or am familiar with, like my hometown for instance, though not always. But in the dreams, these areas are usually quite different and typically larger than in real life. For example, in my dreams, the small local municipal airport near my town is a gigantic aerospace facility I can see from my house, and the town is a city about the size of Dallas, but extending upward more. The nearby lake in my area is arguably the size of a small sea at times in some dreams, though it isn’t small in real life either.

And while aspects of my dreams change from dream to dream, surprisingly it mostly stays consistent. I’ve probably had hundreds of dreams now involving that same city and aerospace facility. Same goes for the lake, or any other dream area I usually visit. My dreams often feel connected because of this, or like continuations of previous dreams. Many times they *are* continuations or sequels to previous dreams, especially when I want one.

All my dreams have reoccurring themes, the basest being that they’re all awesome, adventure style dreams and seem to tell a story. More specifically, I dream about space (both near and deep), space travel, extreme weather like thunderstorms and tornadoes, giant killer robots chasing me through my town, FPS games (been playing Battlefield 3 a lot lately), elements and settings from Skyrim which I have also been playing a lot lately, plane crashes (both in them and seeing them from the ground), train crashes, car crashes, aliens and UFO sightings, etc. 

My dream recall is pretty good, I’d say I usually remember around half of each dream I have in good detail. The other halves are abstract and jumbled, so I can’t put them to words or call them to mind, but they’re still in there somewhere, I can still “feel” them if that makes any sense. My dreams also feel quite long when I’m in them, sometimes weeks or months seem to transpire in them, but once I wake up I can tell it was just hours. The time doesn’t suddenly change, I actually experience the full subjective time within the dream like it’s happening, until I wake up.

Also, important to note that I consider my “nightmares” the same as any other dream, because I strangely enjoy having them. So I lump all my dreams/nightmares into the same category of just being dreams.

Often, my dream characters will be people I haven’t seen in a while, or ones I don’t even know. There are also family members and others I do know, but mostly not. Other times they’ll be characters from video games, movies, shows, or books rarely. And communication in my dreams is typically abstract and non-verbal. I’d like to say it’s telepathic but that also doesn’t describe it much better. It’s like we “speak” in concepts in my dreams, rather than a verbal language.

My dream concepts are also often abstract, which is another reason I find it so difficult to put them to words. And with a heavy emphasis on “feelings”, feelings without actual names, that you get from being in a place or doing something you can’t describe. The kind of stuff you could only draw/paint, and even that might not do it justice. Though, I may try drawing/painting some scenes from my dreams if requested, I’d love to convey what I experience visually and emotionally in the dreams.

I think that mostly covers the major details about the kinds of dreams I have, let me know if you have any further questions about how I dream!

**My actual dreams, I will do my best to describe some from the beginning to the end of where I remember, in as much detail as I can:**

Last night is a great place to start, I had one of my favorite dreams in a while and it was a unique one, rather than a repeat.

The setting is heavily influenced by Skyrim, I was on a snowy, glacier-esque island thing. I was fighting a camp of what were likely bandits with my followers (this part is quite fuzzy). As the fight progressed, with me slashing and blocking and my followers using the bow, it transitioned over to be slightly different. 

I was on the same island, still in the same exact dream, but above us were [Reapers](https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Reaper) from Mass Effect, beginning the process of attacking. The legs of the reaper coming down around us as we’re fighting, and I’m running from the giant laser and slashing at the huge legs with my sword. I could feel the noise the reaper makes in my core, shaking the whole island around me. I was taking damage but not much honestly.

This is when elements from Marvel came into the dream for some reason. I vaguely remember Iron Man helping fight the reapers, but mainly it was Thanos. Thanos crashed down in front of me as I’m fighting one of the reapers, wearing full infinity gauntlet. He gives a grin and a single chuckle, and shoots the reaper with a beam from his gauntlet. He then, from under the burning, broken reaper, lifts it up back into space way above us. It doesn’t explode or fall back or anything, just stays above us not doing anything, but has obvious severe damage. The reaper is dead. There are two others.

But, we leave those to Thanos and whoever else could take them on (probably Thor). My followers and I go off to do something else, and the dream fades back to fuzzy again. I know there’s more to that part, but I can’t recall much of it right now. I wasn’t me in the dream, I was a character from Skyrim (the Dragonborn), having traveled for weeks to get there and traveling off for weeks more on some quest. I could feel the time, I just didn’t experience it in detail.

**The next part** of the dream that I can remember, probably technically a different dream in my sleep cycle, is me getting on a bus/train. Often in my dreams, distinctions about things like that aren’t made, and so it could have literally been both at once. But I took this train through my large dream city, by the huge lake, to the aerospace facility, which also still functions as an airport in the dream too. There I boarded a plane, and cue my reoccurring “on a plane in a thunderstorm” dream. 

The cabin of the plane was roomy, like the whole thing was a first class lounge. Beautiful red carpet and upholstery, soft yellow-white lighting, grey-tan walls. It had an upstairs and downstairs. I was in the downstairs, in the back left. To the front right was a bar-ish area, probably exactly what it was. Hilariously I also remember a floor-to-ceiling pole in that area. Nobody dancing on it, and I didn’t really pay specific attention to any people over there.

I had some acquaintances on the plane, and we were going up and down stairs, doing something, with some kind of objective in mind. Trying to find someone or something maybe, or do something for someone. The bathrooms in the plane were like in a fancy restaurant, large with multiple stalls and porcelain toilets and sinks. Mostly white tiled floors and walls. Bathrooms in my dreams always have public showers for some reason, probably has something to do with me loving showers.

Anyway, next part of the same dream isn’t very fuzzy. I’m back downstairs and the lights flicker a bit and then stay off, save for like maybe one. Something I should mention is that there are often many Chinese people on the flight, and the flight I’m on is usually headed to China. In fact, in my large dream city, many people are Chinese and speak the language. This makes me think my dreams are set decades in the future, my subconscious estimating what it will be like then. 

Back to the plane, the lights go mostly out, and the turbulence really starts. Lightning flashing through the windows, you can feel the thunder vibrating the plane, it nosedives and rolls, heading downward to the ocean. People are screaming, a lot in Chinese, and people are being thrown about the cabin by the turbulence. Myself included, I felt myself bouncing around the inside of the plane before it crashed. Though, in my dreams I don’t typically react to pain. I can’t say I don’t feel it, I do, but it isn’t painful if that makes any sense. I can feel whatever happens but it doesn’t hurt me, whether it’s falling from the sky or getting shot in the head.

**The next dream** in my dream cycle, I launched from the local aerospace facility in a rocket. The initial launch itself is fuzzy, but I remember part of the ascent. Then I’m inside the command capsule, looking out at the earth. I can see the blue and green and brown speckled and striped with white clouds and storm systems. 

Thanks to also playing Kerbal Space Program, I visualize my orbit like I’m in the map of the game, but in my dream. At the nearest point to earth in my orbit, I fire my engine and I’m leaving near earth orbit. 

The dream starts to get fuzzy again, though I remember part of it taking place in deep space, possibly outside the solar system. I also vaguely remember the moon. I may have visited the moon before going off to deep space, but the rest of my dream(s) for that night are fuzzy and vague, though still there.

Thank you for taking the time to read this! Feel free to ask any questions, I’ll try to reply to any I can. I would also love to write about many of my other dreams, those were all just from last night. Though since this is so long, I’ll likely do that in the comments.

0.0,ars0wb,1.0,1.0,"So you guys, I’m kind of worried and would love to get your opinions on this. 

For the last few weeks, I’ve been having an increasing amount of dreams. Before, I’d rarely ever dream, but now, it seems every time I wake up, I can remember another dream. Most of them are negative, although usually not totally terrifying - some make me feel sad, others unsettle me, but I’m never downright scared, like I sometimes used to be with nightmares. I’m always very aware that it wasn’t real, even the moment I woke up.

Which brings me here: for a few days or so, I feel like I‘ve been aware of the fact that I am dreaming while I am within my dream. I believe this is called lucid dreaming? So, not too weird in general, although I don’t have much experience with it. This makes my negative dreams even more uncomfortable, because I spend a lot of time trying to solve the issue or get myself out of the situation. but I always get the „bad ending“ regardless.

-

Now that I’ve set the scene, let me tell you about the dream I just woke up from, before I forget the details:

I‘m at some villa with a man who appears to be my significant other, although we obviously do not know each other very well yet. Perhaps I’m over for the first time. He seems to be in a bad mood for some reason and soon takes a sleeping pill, claiming that this is something he does every day, something he cannot sleep without. It’s the last one in his package.
The pill doesn’t seem to do it for him, so we hike up the driveway, where there is some sort of 24/7 pharmacy. We enter, there’s a few people in there, he grabs a new package of sleeping pills, I get some advice on what lubricant to buy (I think I wanted to take his mind off his bad mood? Not sure). The cashier doesn‘t have any change in the register, so he pays with a 20$ bill and tells her that it’s fine before leaving the store in a rush, me trailing closely behind.

This is where the weird feeling set in. A feeling of... dread, I would say? Starting here, I was aware that something in this dream was going to go terribly wrong.

He hurries down the pitch-black driveway, me following him carefully, afraid that I might trip and snap my neck or something. When I arrive in the living room, he’s on the couch, looking zoned out. I ask how many pills he took. He says 2. So, I begin to freak out, because two pills in addition to the one he took before seems like a lot to me. I tell him that I will force him to throw up now, that there must be other ways to put him to sleep. He begins to assure me that it’s fine, he always does this, but throws up 4 pills immediately - so he must have taken 3 more. All of them are still completely intact, and he reaches out and swallows one again! I freak out on him, he pukes once more, and I quickly pick up all of the pills and take the package with me, as well.

I tell him I need to go to the bathroom to get some wet towels for him, but while I’m in there, I flush the pills and hide the container. I think I was trying to somehow avoid the „bad ending“.

When I get back into the living room, he’s on the couch, trying to strangle himself with his own hands. This made me incredibly angry for some reason - here I was, trying to somehow twist the story in a way that would avoid his certain death, and he’s not the least bit grateful for my attempts.

Now, the next few things happened very quickly, and this part confuses me the most, which is why I took this issue to Reddit in the first place:

I begin what seems to be flashbacks to my other dreams, of people calling me/people being called „fake bot“. At the moment, it seems right to scream it at him. „Fake bot! You don’t even want me to succeed, do you? I don’t want to do this anymore“ or something of the sort.

Suddenly, I’m in a new location, deep inside the woods. I see a blinding light, can feel something lifting me off the ground. At this point, I’m so fed up, I don’t even want to see where the dream is gonna go - I wake up. And at first, I believe that I made myself wake up, like many times before. But then, I sorta question: maybe this was me being „lifted“ out of my dream? It sure felt like something wanted me... out of there?


This all sounds very confusing and all over the place, sorry guys.

TL;DR: some of my dreams have been getting quite unsettling to me and I would love to know how I can stop dreaming so much / stop lucid dreaming. It feels like my dreams wanna plant a freaking conspiracy in my mind and I would prefer for that to stop lmao

&#x200B;

Deep underground, hidden beyond miles and miles of seemingly endless subway tunnels and the utility tunnels off of those, illuminated by sickly green lights a la the subway tunnels in Fallout 3 (though it's been months since I last played it), hides a prison-like cafeteria, in which resides the souls of the dead, but I was not. I was living, but I wandered into this place completely on accident. One character stood out to me, though I didn't and still don't know why. I somehow knew his name to be Rick, he was a Japanese man with thick black wavy hair, shoulder length but shaved on the sides, and he sported a short goatee. While I was transfixed on the appearance of this person, I was told by some Virgil-esque unseen guide that there was a rule in this place: you may leave once, but the second time you enter, you stay forever. As this rule was made known, I watched as Rick pulled out a revolver and shot himself in the chin, killing his soul form and returning to the living world. 

&#x200B;

Weeks later (just last night in fact), I had a very similar dream, despite being almost blow-for-blow ripped from *Atlantis: The Lost Empire* in the beginning. It later, though, became something different. It was sort of like a drug store, but underwater, and the other ""shoppers"" seemed human enough, but wore glass bowls over their heads as they went about as if to hold oxygen, but I didn't have one either.

I end up on this mountainside where a huge village stretches up the mountain for about a mile. Almost steampunky and full of red and black banners. Suddenly a music video starts up. It's supposed to be telling the history of this place through hip-hop I guess. It features 3 black guys in some kind of tribal armor and their place within the chiefdom.

This dream happened on the 10th of April 2018. The dream took place in the 1500's, or at least it looked like it did. I dreamt that I was with Her and we were kind of friends but not really at the same time. We were in this building kind of like in the painting provided. We were being chased by the government to be killed, so she decided that it would be better if one of us lived instead of both of us dying. She told the people that we would fight to the death. I loved her, so I didn't want to hurt her, so I didn't take it seriously. She however did take it seriously. We were both using swords, the closest kind would probably be a Katana. She was doing the standard stance with the blade out in front of her with both hands on the hilt. I was playing around so I had one hand on the hilt and the other on the scabbard. We started making our way upstairs and found ourselves in the bathroom. She asked me why I wasn't taking this seriously, and I told her it was because I didn't want to hurt her. She yelled and told me to take it seriously, so I did. She went for an overhead swing but as she was going to bring the sword down I put up the scabbard in my left hand to make it so she didn't have room to swing. I moved the scabbard and swung downward with my sword while jumping back to give myself some space in case she went for the swing. I look up and see her in her original stance. I had cut her all her fingers along the middle phalanx and she was bleeding. She started to cry but was trying to hold it back. My heart started racing and I dropped my sword and scabbard and ran over to her. I started apologizing over and over again. She dropped her weapon and started to cry. I got bandages and a towel to clean the wound. When I finished the dream ended.

This is where it gets kinda dark..one of my aunts comes in calm as can be and tells everyone that her daughter was just abducted. As she tells us this she is serving some type of dessert. I cant remember how, but immediately after that I was on a quad bike driving in a empty highway with some cousins and my aunt. they all had quads too. Somehow I cut off my aunt while making a left hand turn, and them she swerved into some random guys lane and they all stop. I do a quick turn to go back and apologize and some random guy is already one her face yelling and scream at her. I try to go defuse the situation but as i do that my cousin, her son, sucker punches the guy and knocks him out cold. He keeps beating and beating him. I stop him and i cant tell if the guy he fucked up is dead or not. I tell him that we need to leave and a bunch of other people in quads show up. At this point I assume that this dream world is ran by quad bike gangs or something. but anyways. we get on out quads and go into a tunnel. I feel like I need protection so once i hit the darkness of the tunnel, I end up in a pawn shop looking for guns. i find the exit door after looking and immediately its another pawn shop, then another. and another one. I give up on finding a gun. and once i did, i ended up in the rear stocking are of a store. and find someone there. I can only assume its my cousin or something like that because i didnt even attempt to look at him. so we run to the exit sign. which ends up being a fucked up looking elevator that looks dark with a dim flickering red light inside. I said fuck that and took a door next to it and went inside. I was a library. there was one library lady. And older slim woman with gray hair pointing people into different exits. She said to me something like. ""you got a 72 on violence and.....you're getting the ....ending."" for whatever reason I tell her that i dont want that ending I already had it. She looks at me annoyed. ""So you've already been here before huh? she changes some pages and gives it a look. ""ok here, you get bad ending 1."" I go ""wait, What?!"" So I end up back in the Apex type scenerio. im at the top of a huge waterfall. and there is a purple shield just as the force field gets close. I jump off. Since there is no damage fall damage in game, i land and keep going. Now dreams always blend for some reason. i find a random person who i feel like i have a connection to. I can feel why he is fighting. He is fighting to save someone in the real(but in my dream)world. He has a huge shield but i can tell he cant take another hit. His opponent was some huge jacked up dude who looks like every bad guy from the late 80s movies. this is taking place in a large dry field. I run towards the big guy and tell the other one to run. while i do this a fucking fire lion comes out of both the bad guy and my chest and they start fighting like crazy burning everything including us. As everything starts to go dark, i see what the guy who I told to run away sees. Im now him. The darkness turns to smoke, I get up. it wet and dark. people are unconsious on the ground. There is women attempting to help children who are on the ground. I get up and hear a little girl yell. I turn around and see that I am outside of a kids schools of some sort in the middle of a town. I run and break open a door to get in. Once inside everything looked burned, but sturdy. like only the surface burned. I hear something to my right and turn to look. There are some stairs that lead to a basement. I rush down. Once I got downstairs hit the corner of the stairway, I saw a decapitated body hanging from a hook. I stop fast almost falling back. ""holy shit"" I hear myself say. right after I said that,ai hear the most spine chilling laugh that have hear. I slowly turn around and see a shadow ghost upside down hanging similar to spiderman. My vision starts to shake from fear which turns to anger. I lunge at it. To my surprise I didn't miss, and felt something physical. but it wasn't the ghost. as I went to grab it the ghost did that same laugh. I looked up at the ghost then looked to see what I was actually holding on to. It was the torso of a woman. No head, legs, arms. Just the torso. I let go but it just floated in mid air. I hear a laugh again. Her bra falls off and two bombs fall out. Everything from her on goes in slow motion. I try to run up the steps but it takes forever. I start to see fire surrounding me. my body starts to feel weightless. then nothing. Credits start rolling. It was only for about one second but so it was a blur.

S1 started joking around with this idea, and the guy next to him interrupted and said “we already talked about it, now stop discussing it”. So S1 said one last thing, he said that drugs has caused my old friends to do stuff that are quite odd: they did not feel pain or fear.

The guy next to S1 was holding a mini machete, and slit a small portion of the left side of finger and stared at me. I ran to the study kiosk in the back library, in fear that he would have some bad ideas in mind. As presumed, he slowly walked down the back library with his knife and trapped me in the back. He further slit the right side of his finger and started to bleed more. Then in one quick action, he got the knife right underneath his eyes and cut a huge portion of his cheeks.

I was trapped in the back wall, with no other option but to out run him. I ran to the left, but that was not quick enough. So I ran to the right and that was somehow countered by him. There he was, eyeing me down with these vivid hazel eyes and a five’o clock shadow.

The dream starts with me in high school. In the high school, the most popular girl was a girl named Emerald. She was like a typical rich girl. Her hair was dyed green, green contact lens, and green lipstick.

The least popular girl was a girl named Beryl. Brown hair, brown eyes. She had really low self esteem, and very introverted. She's twin sisters with Emerald.

Emerald was not nice to Beryl. She'd constantly belittle her about everything. Not even Beryl's parents like Beryl. It's safe to say that Beryl's life sucked.

&#x200B;

The date is Feburary 14th. I was in class. My class was all boys except for  Emerald and Beryl. Every boy gave Valentine's cards to Emerald (she was not grateful for any one of them). But I gave my Valentine's card to Beryl, which shocked everyone in the room.

Then the dream had a montage of me and Beryl spending time together as a couple. I don't know if you've ever been in a montage, but it's pretty disorientating. One moment, I'm at a picnic, the next moment, I'm watching a movie. Anyways, the montage ends with me and Beryl about to watch the fireworks. Emerald was there in the background, still scoffing at the fact that anyone would ever date Beryl.

&#x200B;

The fireworks were about to go off, but then I woke up.

&#x200B;

I gotta say, I was really sad that Beryl wasn't real.

Later on, I tried analysing the dream. I figured, since Beryl is not a real person, she must've come from somewhere. And that somewhere has to be my brain, meaning Beryl is a part of me. She's a manifestation of my insecurities, and me being her girlfriend represents how deep down, I just needed a shoulder to cry on.

The furnishings are mostly pretty junky- dirty curtains, some of that fake wood pattern paneling in certain places, the counter space in the kitchen looks like it's out of a diner from the 90s.

Suddenly I hear my window open, and I can hear the sound of the curtains moving around, so I get up and immediately yell at the guy ""what the fuck are you doing?"" He was creepy and old, and looked like he was having none of the current interaction, because he threw his hands in the air and left. I noticed there were other people there too, one of which was a younger black woman who stayed, doing something to my window. I figured they must be doing maintenance, so I asked. Instead of interacting with me, she just ignored me and kept doing what she was doing. That made me really pissed, so I naturally hauled ass outside.

Only, when I opened the door, there was no balcony, steps or floor. I was four stories up and had no way of leaving without falling to my death. I almost fell, but the door handle was large and strong enough to support my weight. After helplessly swinging for a few seconds, I got back inside. I poked my head out once again. ""Are you doing maintenance?"" And she said ""yeah, we did the floor below you last week"".

I woke up in real life and went back to bed

This time, I found myself talking to a gray haired man in a room where mostly everything looked like stainless steel. I was hooked up to a bunch of strange machinery and there were a crap-ton of wires coming out of something on my head. Based on the questions he was asking me, I deduced that I'm a part of a sleep study experiment that is trying to prove that past life experiences are real. He was specifically interested in the dream I had last (narrow apartment dream). I told him all about it. He said some weird stuff about particles and neurons and then told me it was, in fact, a past life dream, and that I'm a very rare and important subject. 

However one thing struck me as odd: the alarm clock in the apartment was incredibly futuristic looking. It was holographic, and looked out of place considering the rest of the furnishings. It was at this moment when it dawned on me that this dream could be the future. So I told him about the alarm clock and the fact that it couldn't be a past life because of how advanced the technology is. I remember being very concerned about the fact that I've seen my future, and could possibly change it. He looked shocked, and suddenly, a number of men rushed into the lab and drug me away. 

I think the first dream with the narrow apartment was my future as a detainee of some sort, and the reason why I ended up there is because of my interaction with the scientist in my second dream.

I thought these two dreams were pretty interesting because the premise is kind of paradoxical- my future in the narrow apartment was cemented in time as soon as I realized it could happen, and the science guys made sure I was detained there.

Anyhoo, eventually my dad came to find me and took me into some kind of museum-style thing. I wandered over to the gift shop which seemed to be vaguely Harry Potter-themed for some reason.

On each of the three walls in the alcove were really tall wooden shelves, and they had various books and models of the magical beasts from Harry Potter. Irl, I study mythological entities and creatures throughout world cultures, and so I remember in the dream being mildly annoyed as to the inaccuracy of the information being presented in the books. 

Now onto the bit where I actually remember reading. I was looking through an encyclopaedia-like guide to the creatures of the Harry Potter universe - and I can explicitly remember reading recognisable text, and I remember sections of this text: 

'La Llorona are often seen around water, where they were supposedly born' 

(The book depicted La Llorona as a merfolk-like creature instead of a ghost, which annoyed me. I remember another bit of the text about it which said something about them not being able to study it until they had a proper classification, but apparently the writer had faith that Harry could provide this for them)

'There are ever-increasing sightings of hairy bigfoot-like creatures in Iowa. There are actually two species, one of which is a human-primate hybrid related to the Yolandi, and another is a vicious and predatory monster' 

And yes I know that Yolandi is the name of one of the singers in Die Antwoord as opposed to actually being a mythical creature. I think my brain was trying to say Yeren, which is a hairy humanoid creature. 

Anyhoo - yes so I remember reading this book. I wasn't in the gift shop anymore, and was instead lying on my side in my bed.

0.0,arittb,0.0,2.0,"This dream began with me having a first-person experience as a minuscule person inside of some kind of extremely claustrophobic machine. There was a jumping pad of some description made from a spring and a round leather end located in the centre of the machine, directly above it in the ceiling was a closed-off escape route which I kept attempting to bounce through using the jumping pad. This was to no avail, however, as I could only leap up a limited distance using it and even if I did reach the escape route it was defended by a pair of closed shutters.

I was somewhat tempted to scream by how tight the confines of the machine were, but before I could, I noticed a small door open in the wall ahead of me. The microscopic room was filled with outside light as I recognised the eyes of Mr Tweedy staring at the insides of the machine I was residing. The farmer looked about without speaking any words or noticing me at any point before closing the door and leaving me in the dark once again.

After multiple moments of silence, the machine around me began to physically transform. The walls turned a luxurious-looking crimson colour before the bottom halves of each wall became made out of large six-sided dices. The dices protruded out of the walls with square sections of different, dully-saturated colours (red, orange and green were most memorable). I could feel the 'machine' becoming slightly larger in interior size and turning into something that reminded me of an exotic hotel, although it was still extremely tight and claustrophobic.

During this transformation, I became a third-person observer in the dream: I lost my 'physical' presence that I had used when I was bouncing in-order to escape. I myself had became a static pair of eyes during the shift, an unseen observer if you will.

Through my new perspective, I noticed that the aforementioned door that Mr Tweedy had glared through had become that of a rectangular wooden door with a handle. The door was opened by a gigantic Wallace of the reputable Wallace and Gromit, who smiled, stuck his huge hand in and probed about before declaring that there was 'plenty of space'.

After this, Wallace and Gromit entered through the open door: either they had shrunk in-order to gain access or the 'machine' had increased in size, as they were the right size to enter and explore despite Wallace having been a giant a few seconds earlier. At this point, I notice that some of the red dices inside the wall appeared to be deteriorating and crumbling towards the floor. These dices were paler in appearance, and one of the most reddish-white dices had broken clean off onto the floor itself.

The duo stopped in the middle of the machine turned dice hotel's interior. I could now see clearly out of the open door: the environment outside was, at-least at the moment I saw it, a kind of sunny beach paradise. It contrasted starkly against the murky dark of the dice hotel.

Wallace and Gromit began to exchange with each-other, strangely enough Gromit had acquired a voice. Their conversation was initially fairly amiable although the subject transitioned to Gromit's mathematics GCSE. Gromit seemed to be avoiding the details of something in conversation, which triggered Wallace to begin pressuring him and asking him how much time he had spent gambling when he was supposed to be studying. As it turned out Gromit had failed his mathematics exam multiple times, and as Wallace asked him resignedly if he was going to have to re-sit it again, Gromit trotted off in shame.

It ended with Gromit sadly picking up the white-red dice which had broken off of the wall at the strange, pale crumbling site developing on it.",new,"I have experienced a pattern of Aardman-themed dreams, this time it was Gromit's Gambling Addiction",2.0

Sometimes dreams can have meanings that are related to ones life, or some dreams are premonitions. I can make links between what i see in a dream, and what will happen in the real world. I'm usually accurate for the most part, because the consistency of the dreams that i have.

Ever since the new year, i  been having recurring dreams of a possible contact with a flying saucer. The dreams usually start off normal,  i look at the sky, and see something and say hmmmmm is that a ufo, oh shit let me hide, it gets closer and closer, and i always run away from it and i usually **feel a sense of fear.**

Last night takes the cake, which prompts this post.

As mentioned above, the dream starts off as me doing something, and then suddenly becoming aware that their is a unidentified flying object. It always appeared distant.  This time i wasn't so nervous or anxious. I remember trying to hide from it, only their was no where to hide. It came closer to lower altitudes, the lower it got the more i felt this IMMENSE TERROR/ASTONISHMENT. It was nothing that i never seen before.

We were in traffic, and we all stopped to get out of our cars to take a look at this gigantic white saucer shaped ufo, we were froze in terror, and in shock not knowing what could happen.

I remember, a friend calling me telling me he sees a ufo as well. The last thing i can remember, is seeing this bright white light and im being sucked in to this ufo. Thats all i can remember.

Idk what to make of this.

Then another kid comes to mug me, while I was talking with the other kid. I don't remember the details but the 3rd kid died. I somehow got my money back from the kid I talked with, who I actually started to like. So after the 2nd kid got off the tram, another kid came to mug me. After I gave him money, I got off the tram and went somewhere (I don't really remember). I was walking down the street, and I saw the kid who mugged me last, and I managed to get him arrested. I got on a tram and I was getting mugged by 3 people, who wanted all of my money for themselves, because they actually don't know each other.

0.0,arict6,0.0,1.0,"Had a nap. Woke up right after things somewhat improved between 'me' and the yandere while I was held hostage by the yandere love interest (a quarter of my face was sliced off by him) - okay so to the beginning of this story or from what I can remember...

Basically, was in an accomodation of sorts that mixed in with an office building and this yandere love interest who was in the beginning a pretty normal and nice guy who 'I' was crushing pretty hard and seemed like it was mutual, we lived together as housemates. Thing is- he had to be gone for a few business days. Okay, that's happened a fair bit. 

My dad came to visit and suddenly the elevator with us both in it fell off and I woke up injured in a hospital- turns out it was his replacement/apprentice at the building for having messed around with the yandere's magic force field or something just so they could use their laptop. Apparently the after effects were so strong the apprentice ended up being rendered immobile and the people in the building felt a tremor. The elevator malfunctioned and since my dad and I were in it, we both apparently had concussions after knocking our heads during the elevator's malfunctioned fall caused by the tremor and woke up in the hospital. 

For some reason soon after that, 'I' ended up reflecting on the past of the yandere's relationship with 'me' and somehow managed to snoop around their work place, met some old acquaintances and somehow some things clicked in place - that there was something nasty in his past and you were right. 

Turns out his job isn't a simple office worker like the building would suggest - it was just a front for the rather illegal things they do of going around carrying out assassination jobs to appear like an accident- pay was lucrative and then 'I' had dreams (lol dreams within a dream) of some sort of abstract monster thing that sliced off another abstract abomination that was running away from it 

Fast forward a few days when yandere's back and that I found out about his actual job from conversing with his apprentice and other old memories of curious things, and I can't remember exactly what I said to him or did but that dream I had of seeing an abstract thing be sliced off by another abstract thing apparently- was me. 

Oh it just came to me. I was in a massage parlor of sorts where both me and yandere had went to in the past as a fun outing and I was investigating some of the hints / things the apprentice has informed me (can't remember what exactly) with one of the staff that dealt with us then and yandere found me there in the middle of my investigation and something must have snapped in him because he killed the staff I was talking too messily with a knife and rhen- the dream happened. 

He sliced me next. But he let me live. It actually hurt, I remember being in the moment of this and it hurt a lot but the dream continued anyway. It went right above my eyebrows, the knife I mean, and then he made sure it was embedded deeply before bringing it to a downwards curve and removing that side of my face permanently. He started acting caring then, saying he didn't want to do it but I made him do it because I was investigating him and for breaking his trust and for no longer being the same like I was (?) - and nursed me back, bandaging the side of my face he hurt. 

From then on- things were frosty and he dropped his nice cute selfless persona for a ruthless and apathetic selfish one. I remember being fearful and afraid of everything- he locked me inside with him not being able to go out, but right before I woke up from this entire thing- I remember being on the sofa next to him and watching television and some channels I changed to either enraged him or was boring. I somehow managed to I suppose revert back to before this happened acting like things were the same some time during the switched channels making a couple of jokes (using comedy to deal with the trauma I suppose) and then just as I was allowed to take a bath- I woke up. It was pretty disgusting. I was treated like a pet metaphorically chained with fear. I think he ended up killing his apprentice too for running his mouth off

So, last night, I dreamt that I went out to a mall in my town. Initially, I was with my mom, but we got separated. Somewhat worried, I walked around, before sitting on the floor and waiting. My mother never came.

Eventually, however, this nice Asian man did. He offered to take me back to his place for supper. Not being one to turn down and offer, and maybe(?) knowing that it was a dream, I accepted his offer. We drove to his house. I learned that his name was Mr. Li at some point.

When we arrived, he introduced me to his wife and children, who were all very warm and welcoming. Because supper wasn't quite done, I went downstairs to play pinball with his kids (4-5 younger than me, 2 older than me). I got on my cell, and called my mom, but she didn't want anything to do with me. She effectively disowned me and evicted me from home. IIRC it had something to do with my transition (MtF). 

Needless to say, I was kinda bummed.

I went back up to the dining room, where they had a giant feast laid out. I vividly remember some orange chicken being there. We dug in. But during dinner, Mr. Li noticed something was wrong with me. He asked what was up, and I told him everything. 

Mr. Li and his wife said I could stay at their place until I got sorted out. I accepted their offer, and finished up dinner. Then I got to play some video games, before going to bed in dream. When I woke up the next in-dream day, after having a nice helping of waffles, Mr. Li offered me something else:

He offered to adopt me.

Excitedly, I accepted his offer, crying. He and my new family hugged me. I was happy beyond words. Immediately, I began greeting my siblings (in Chinese for some reason). My older brother and sister offered to take me out shopping.

We went to the mall, and bought some rare coins at a coin store and some clothes. We returned home, and I helped my little siblings with homework. I was actually excited to do homework (cue X-Files theme).

The next day, I went back to high school (even though IRL I've already graduated). It was massive! Some old teachers from my old high school were there. I was going through High School as a girl this time, and was really giddy about it.

We made it to work and she stayed on my back and oddly enough i was in a room with several other coworkers of mine who all had their dogs.

My boss was in the middle of the room and chastised the girls mother saying “new rule, watch your children around the dogs it’s not their fault they bite” and I was really pissed off by that, because the dog was aggressive and the girl wasn’t instigating.

I was on my bed thinking about sleeping after ""waking up"" from a dream but then my feeling of touching was weakened so I automatically went:""oh shit this a dream again"" (Plus my eyes were tunnel visioned) so when ever I get self aware about a dream being a dream a monster that crawls on the floor pops up under my bed or outside, so I just yelled:""Ok I know this is a dream so come out""  so a guy that walked like Quasimodo he was like the height of 80 meters because of that. He just comes into my room asking for something then I hand over something that was crawling outside of my room so then he asks:"" can you come with me"" then I answer:"" But I already gave you my thing"" then he says:"" She is waiting for you"" so I said:"" Nah imma go this way"" but then he answers back:"" she dares you"" so I think I could get something in return so I go with it and I see my second arch nemesis in my dreams, a creature that is smarter than me, it is a she has greenish skin, and I can't describe the face but it is not human, so she was in the living room so I go near middle table where the sofa is also near, then she says if you read this book I will go away, then I said:""if i read this book you and all of your friends will go away and I will control my dreams in the future"" then she says ok and the dream ends like that, then i go to sleep.

For some background: this is about a very close family member of mine, my favorite person in the world, who dealt with suicidal thoughts and tendencies and and many failed attempts about 1-2 years ago. Those couple of years were very hard for her, and the memories of those times still haunt the both of us. I’m also currently having similar thoughts, but not nearly to the extent that she did. This is going to be a long post, so just bear with me.

The first part of the dream is pretty foggy, but from what I know, we were sitting in my bedroom; I was on the edge of my bed (which is very low to the floor), and she was sitting on the floor. Everything about my surroundings was exactly the way it is in the real world. 

We made a suicide pact, and decided to end our lives together by swallowing pills. She got up and left the room. I sat there with an overwhelming sad and ominous feeling. Not about my own death, but about hers. She came back with two little containers with pills in them for each of us. I stared at them and back at her, and said “I don’t want to do this”. This visibly upset her because she knew I was going to try and stop her from going through with it on her end. She tried to take the pills and I knocked them out of her hands. I explained to her how I can’t lose her, how important she is and how she needs to live. I looked at her and told her what a blessing she is to this earth. I have no idea what exactly I had said in the dream, but I remember exactly how it felt when I was talking to her, and it felt like that was what I had said.

I pulled her into a hug, and this was by far the most real part of any dream I’ve ever had. We began to both uncontrollably sob our hearts out. I felt a lump in my throat from the pain of it all. Absolutely every emotion about her that I’ve kept bottled up - both in dream and the real world - poured out of me and my heart ached the worst that it’s ever done. Every single feeling of love that I felt for her was pouring out of my heart for her to see in full display. I remember absolutely every aspect how I felt in that moment. The most real feeling of raw emotion that I’ve ever felt in my life happened in a dream...

I can’t remember anything happening after that.

I was fighting off these zombies on what was similar to the Great Wall of China in this frozen land, and I was with a couple friends. The zombies were going to take over the world, and we had to stop them. But we realized that it was impossible, and my friends started to die. Eventually, I died too.

Now, after I died, I became aware that I was in a simulated reality video game. Only, instead of waking up when I died, as I was suppose to, I woke back up in the same “map” or area. Only, this time nobody was with my anymore. It was just snow and darkness and me. 

I started wandering around, and quickly realized that I could possibly be here for eternity. After all, time moves much slower in this simulations that real life. Years in the game could be seconds in real life. A feeling of dread took over me, and I began to panic.

Suddenly, an option popped up on the “screen.” Join room by calling xxx-xxxx. I knew that this was not normal as I had played the game a thousand times. I also knew that simulation terrorism was on the rise, and I could be led to an absolute hell when people are tortured for eternity. All my friends were gone, so I instantly realized that they were in the same predicament. 

1) stay alone forever in the snowy darkness... or at least until you cave and choose option 2.
2) call the phone number and join other people, but most likely be in hell. Yet, there’s still a chance that you won’t. Hey, maybe you’ll even get out. But you have heard the stories... in the back of your mind, you don’t think this is good...

At this point I woke up in absolute terror.

On my way to my destination, I passed the wife of my boss from about 2012-2014. She was pushing a cart with their son (I frequently saw both his wife and his son while working there IRL — it was without a doubt them). I stopped to do the typical girly catch up chatter of “Hey, omg, how are you?! How’s [Boss’ first name]? Man, [Son] is so big now!” When I last saw [son] he was about four but he had aged to about 9 or 10 in my dream, which is how old he would be now.

As I was talking to her we were passed by a very overweight man in leather pants and a flamboyantly poofy shirt. I instantly recognized him as a man who was in my opera/choir programs at college. In school he was what I now know as a serious neckbeard, including the neck full of skin tags, 3 wolf moon shirts, and obsession with anime women. He had a really nice tenor voice though so he got cast in everything we did. My boss’ wife (who I’m 99% positive would never have met this guy IRL), turns and calls the opera singer over. She tells him he looks good (it’s true — in my dream he has lost quite a bit of weight, although he is still well past the obese threshold), and she asks him if he is still singing. Then she urges him to audition for the opera program run by the college in my current city of residence.

That’s when my husband woke me up.

A few months later, I had a dream where I was following the same river while playing my fiddle, but this time I was walking in the river rather than next to it, and I had to keep playing even though my fiddle was getting wet.

Last night, I had that same dream again, but the river was made of blood and full of hellish-looking bugs, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't keep my blood-stained fiddle in tune long enough to play well.

So this is all an experience from me reading a book and it's in first person from the guys point of view. So these two people, a man and a woman, wake up on an ice floe in a very thin river, then a wolf sized fox and a bear climb onto said ice floe. Now at this point I have a minecraft hot bar and all that was in it was a sharpened version of the stick that said ""toothpick,"" keep in mind this wasn't really a goofy situation.

Anyway theres a bit of a gap then we appear in this super dark apartment with some other guys that are merely cowarding black figures, now outside it looks like hell, massive towering buildings and mountains on fire, a river of lava and a highway that stretches out of view covered in armored vehicles shooting at a mountain. Suddenly there's a road right outside the window with a flaming tank at a steep 45° angle to the right, hundreds of soldiers come up a ramp on the other side of the tank. They're all dressed in post apocalyptic armor with mainly black and red in all sorts of clothing and configurations. This one guy who appears to be their leader wearing a mask with three glowing dots and a raggedy trench coat covered in various leather straps  (Within like a second of the mass apperance of soldiers) poured a rectangual jerry can of gas on a flaming hatch on the tank and it exploded as the world went black. Then the words ""american soldiers!"" were shouted. The world was still black.

We then appeared in what apperaed to be a mix of an office and a creepy basement with the board supports and randomly ranging in lighting but mainly looked like a night mode screen without the yellow tint. This time it was me, the female, and a copy of me (not myself irl, just a guy with simultaneously black and brown curly hair down to his shoulders and quite handsome that I've been seeing from this whole time) that I didn't think anything of. So this is like that one scp that's the infinite ikea and it just goes on forever. Now this place is full of these humans with (idk how else to describe it) fucked up faces and proportions. They range from being proportioned wrong and being generally uncomfortable to look at to being demonic swirls of flesh with bodies contorted and twisted in ways that shouldn't be thought about. So I'm instantly seperated from the others with just my 'toothpick'. So I just run around mainly avoiding these godforsaken creatures and end up stabbing two in the neck like a video game animation as they disappear into dust and melt into liquid at the same time then completely disappear. The toothpick disappears and that's the only time I actually felt scared in this dream for some reason. So I'm just running around and somehow find another 'toothpick' and that one disappears after killing only one creature. The environment changes from cluttered office to creepy basement and everything in-between. So I stumble across this room that looks like an ikea show room, very nice looking but just a bit too artificial. And in it is an exact copy of me and the woman smiling inhumanely but that's the only fucked up thing about them unlike all the others.

 It seemed like an eternity as I yelled at them thinking it was my copy and the woman while moving my head like a curious puppy. Then I somehow knew these were the leaders and I ran. I got cornered in an abnormally long cubicle. But I got a pistol and the minecraft hotbar turned into a pubg weapon hotbar. So I shoot like 3 of those twisted creatures in the head and jump over the cubicle wall. After running around a bit I get 3 pistols all being operated by their own arm that never missed. So I eventually find my clone and the woman and we're just about to be overrun by those godamn things swarming from all directions when a perfectly square hatch opens. This hatch was at a 45° angle at a 90° corner of a wall somehow. So after going through the hatch theres a faint bit of someone familiars voice talking about ""civil unrest""and "" you learn why later"" and me yelling ""don't spoil it!"" then the movie adaptation starts. So theirs a baby doing like whatever that old timey dance with spinning is overlayed with classical music split with brief flashes of riots that range in quality from oldest black and white to 4k. Finally its me (my character) and the woman driving in an old looking red classic american car along a river in a snowy forest and crashing. The man is on the ice floe with a bear and a wolf sized fox and the woman is on the bank. All I remember is thinking ""wtf, that's not how it happened!"" before being woke up by my dad while drenched in sweat.

Note: The 'toothpick' was just a pointy stick and not small like a toothpick. The woman had longish brown hair that looked cracked and dry and had a face that looked old but was smooth like a young person.

TL:DR get teleported from all sorts of locations from an icy river to hell and have to eventually fight off a bunch of messed up humanoids in an office/creepy basement. Then I get to see the beginning of a movie adaptation of the whole thing. I'm not good at TL:DRs so sorry.

I was sitting in work that day and around 4pm, I got a snapchat request, it was him, adding me on snapchat.

I tucked it into my bag as I couldn't wear it during the game. I go inside, I change into my uniform, and I play the game, no big deal. 

After the game, I'm changing back into my street clothes and I put the necklace on. I turn around and this big burly guy starts complimenting the necklace. He's saying how pretty it is and how he would love to have it. I thank him and tell him I just got it from my boyfriend so there's no parting with it. He starts getting angry and yelling that he wants it. He says its worth 15 thousand dollars and he won't take no for an answer. I weave around him and run to my car and race home. I run inside and turn off all the lights to make it seem like I'm not there. I have my phone in my hand to call the police just in case he shows up. I look out the window and I see his black truck pulling up the driveway. I start calling 911 and I tell the operator that this big man is coming to my house to steal my necklace and they should send the police. I hang up the phone and run up to my attic where there's a safe room. I hear the man rummaging in my house looking for me and then things fade to black.

My dream shifts to the third person with my parents and my boyfriend at my house. There's police everywhere. My parents are in my room crying and the police are saying my body is basically mutilated in the attic. My boyfriend went up there to look and he was upset that I didn't have my necklace on. 

There was more to the dream but I felt this was long enough so I'll just stop it here. I have super weird dreams and I just felt like sharing it somewhere to look back on. ",new,I had a dream an angry trucker wanted my necklace.,6.0

Myself a 23 year old man who's never been in a relationship had this extensive dream of a man, his wife and his daughter going through their usual morning. I had no sense of self during this dream, I wasn't any of the people in this dream either, it was like being left with the memory of a movie or something. 

It started with a morning where they made breakfast for their daughter before school and the whole time had this hateful tension between them. They didn't seem to love each other anymore and every little thing would set them off on a passive aggressive argument like ""you're going to burn her pancakes, you're such a bad cook"" or ""you should be more of a man"" or saying sarcastically ""well at least I have a wife who loves me"" etc. It ended on that last line and there was a long pause where nobody said anything and that was it.

After moving through 2 outposts which were really just any common place Id go through during a normal week such as schools and stores and my house..  We learn in a mall that the robots are allergic to nickel and graphite. They would melt if they touched it. We end up in a fancy hotel. 2 men in the hotel know about the robots weakness and offer us a full bag of pencil graphite sticks which we take. I also had a mechanical pencil. The robots seemed to know that they are allergic to graphite but the didn’t try to stop us from obtaining it. Once we had graphite the robots just kinda surrendered and became docile around us. If we touched them they would melt. We pushed them back like this. The dream ended before any of us had a decisive victory. Although a robot apocalypse will never happen, just remember that graphite is your best weapon. Grab a pencil and start stabbing if you need to. The pen(cil) is mightier than the sword.

0.0,ar8ki5,0.0,1.0,"so, in advance, I apologize as i might have forgotten some of the information thanks to my PC which decided to fuck me off by being super slow today, knowing i was in a rush. anyway, with my sob story out of the way, i've been repeating my dream over and over again, so it shouldn't be too much of a problem if i forget a few things.

so anyway, i'd first like to establish the scenery of this so called ""Cloud City"" beforehand.

first, using my very professional picture editing skills, take a look at this image. the image was also taken on google earth, so pretend the images aren't wavy and distorted: https://imgur.com/a/9K32X5W

now, imagine that with a bunch of snow on it, and you're good to go.

so now, in terms of the ""storyline"", i remember when i first got into the dream we were walking up some stairs until eventually, we reached the top. i don't know whether or not it was just my friends, my classroom, hell even the entire school. i ""remembered"" that my friend made a snapchat story about this same place, but in the story there wasn't any snow in the neighborhood. the house on the far left, when you go inside, was just a giant basketball arena. the other house looked more like an indoor amusement park, though i don't remember much about that house.

however, there was also a third house not shown in this image. it could have either been that it didn't show up in my dream at all, or  that i just forgot what it looked like. however, i do remember the inside. first, imagine a modern prison. now remove all the cells and rooms so that all you're left with is just a metal-like floor and cement walls. in the center was a GIANT square hole (i'm talking HUGE, but not so that it took up most of the floor). since i'm a little squeemish about heights irl and in the dream, but while also being curious, i took a look down at the hole making sure i wouldn't accidently fall down it. basically, it was a place where you'd fall down to the actual world. now, the main attraction is when you go to the right. here, you'll see some room without a door. when you look ""inside the room"", you'll see some area on earth. as i found out later in my dream, when you walk inside the room you are VERY SUBTLY teleported, and the place where you exited cloud city would just be replaced with a mirror. however, people in cloud city can still see you.

for the first time around, it was looking at some sort of bathroom. not any bathroom however. imagine a large football stadium, and now compress it so it is the size of a middle school gymnasium, and is indoors. place a toilet and possibly a sink (forgot what the other object was) and there you go. we were looking at it for a while until we see some guy come up from the bottom, as if you were to drag a picture up in some photo editing software. the guy was basically a blend between Kanye West and Will Smith. we eventually didn't go inside the room.

so, after a bunch of shit happens which i forgot, we come to this room again and are greeted with kids play. basically one of those elementary school things where you're forced into singing or going on a play. in my dream it was some sort of play, but once i awoke i realized it was just a fucking closet on the inside. eventually i went inside the room against the advice of the people next to me. as i said before, the exit was replaced by a mirror, so i couldn't go back.

last thing i remember was in class. we were using chromebooks and my friend gave me some sort of schedule relating to cloud city. i looked at the time and realized it matched the first step in the schedule, but it was too late as he already left without me. instead of getting off my ass and fucking leaving to cloud city too, i give up and just wake up.",new,"Cloud City (or, well, cloud neighborhood)",1.0
0.0,ar8986,0.0,1.0,"I was a boy who grew up on the edge of a fault. Our house was made of stone, on the top of a cliff. Overlooking a large flooded canyon. It could be seen that there were roads and bridges that led into the canyon. There were giant falls pushing more water into the canyon, making the old roads into fast rivers. The planet we were on was collapsing. Mass flooding and fissures. 

My family; mother, father, me, older sister, and my dog. Were to be on one of the first few ships out. Because my father was a famous novelist and my mom a robotics engineer.
A ship moving towards a new planet. 
It was massive. The size of a large town. Living quarters, a mall, any restaurant imaginable through ordering panels on walls. Any tv show/movie/station through panels as well. 

I was a chubby boy. It would take years to get to the next planet. I quickly made a group of friends, a girl with blonde hair, an Asian boy, a lanky goth boy, a quiter girl with red hair who wasn't always with us, and a large stocky brown hair boy a lil older than the rest and not always nice. The blonde girl was the daughter of the ships main captain. He had designed the ship and piloted it, his wife had died in a flooding shortly before boarding she had been a research scientist. It was fun being friends with her because she knew all about the ship and the fun extras. Like the abandoned quarters that were meant to hold others incase  the population soared. 

We grew up together into our teens. I became less chubby, taller, and leanly muscled because I wandered so much. But as the years went by there were increasingly strange incidences on the ship. People changing attitudes, getting cabin fever everyone would say. Sometimes violence came out. Police bots would stop it. Mom was almost never home. My father became cruel, would hit me my dog, scream at me, be creepy towards my sister. My sister was increasingly absent as she had taken up with a member of the ships crew and couldn't stand my father. Most nights I would sleep in the abandoned sector because I didn't want to go home. Sometimes the blonde or stocky boy would join. But the stocky boy would only join if blonde was staying. 

We were in a gaming hall one day. When these two affluent old ladies got into a bad fight. Screaming, grabbing for each other, I got the one I knew somewhat away. She had been laughing hysterically on and off while she fought trying to dig her nails into the other. I knew she was very looks oriented and cheap even though she was rich so I told her if she came with me I'd use my credit to buy her a spa treatment. She agreed. But as we walked there she became increasingly delusional.  Talking of things not real or so far in the past they made no sense. I got her into the shop and put my credit into the wall and told her to pick what she wanted, that I would be back. 

I went to check on my friends. But the gaming hall had turned odd. There were fights breaking out. Shouting matches. Strange groupings of people kissing, and devolving into orgy like behavior. I saw my stocky friend in one of those, I went up to him to drag him away. He was kissing another male, while two older men and one women were pulling his pants down. When I walked up his eyes looked manic, he asked me to join. I asked him to leave with me. He punched me, laughed and called me a name. I left quickly after that. When I got back to my older lady she had corn rows on half her head, and dread locks in the back, and her normal coiffed hair on the other side. I approached her and asked if she was okay. She was talking to herself in the mirror ignoring me. I went back out to call my friend, the halls were getting busier, the people being increasingly odd. My blonde friend answered reported the lady she was with had taken her hair pins out and repeatedly stabbed herself in the neck, they were busy with the police. We would get together later. I checked on my old lady but she had gotten a razor and had begun shaving all of her head while screaming. I tried to stop her but she was surprisingly strong. 

My phone/watch started beeping. It was an alert. That all citizens receiving this transmission were to follow the map being sent and block off all doors that were marked. It was said the ship had been compromised that there were intruders with chemical weapons infecting the ship causing hysteria. violence, and debauchery. 

I ran toward these sectors. Using back halls that maintenance mostly used. I blocked each door I could with random items, we were mostly in the section that held schoold. The University and high school. I ran into some other frantic people, but they were all doing as I did. Later when an okay had been broadcasted some of us had come together in the cafeteria of the high school. Our watches could not broadcast out at this point. We all talked and theorized. Almost no one slept. None of my friends were there. 

At about 3am we were awoken to a mass broadcast on the ships panels. We were under attack by deep space creatures called imps. Red tiny creatures with long limbs, who could crawl down the throats of individuals, feeding off them sickening them and taking them over. You could tell an infected person by their pink protruding veins on their arms and necks. If a normal person made contact with one of these they became infected as well but were not taken over by an imp directly. It was causing all the behaviors. An antidote was being made and police bots dispatched. We were told all would be well in a week. 

No other communications after that. We were well fed from panels, and had entertainment but anxiety and mistrust were high. Fights broke out daily. I tried to avoid any groups after that. When the week was up, nothing. I started to explore. Hoping I could find a way to the abandoned sector. Hopefully my friends had hidden there and were safe. With some looking I found a way to that sector but would briefly have to cross into the unsafe territory. I did it anyway. I saw debris everywhere, smoke was heavy in the air. I could hear horrible sounds. 
I made my way into the sector. There were my friends but the stocky boy was there also the one who I saw acting strangely. The quiet ginger girl in his lap. We were all happy to see each other. I said nothing about my friends behavior. 

We had to do something. Blonde wanted to find her mother or father because of their status and information. We all agreed. We trekked to the mothers labs first. 
We had to cross into unsafe territory. We disguised ourselves in rags, and acted like the groups we passed. Loud, obnoxious, rude, sometimes violent. But we came across a group that was raping and murdering another, we became backed up against. The stocky friend turned on us then. Attempting to rape the blonde, the ginger girl went after our goth friend. I managed to save the blonde, but our goth friends throat had been sliced while the ginger girl rode him covered in his blood. Our stocky friend swore vengeance. 

I, the blonde, and our asian friend finally made it to the labs. They were abandoned but intact. There were suits on the walls. Blonde found an old com from her mom, explaining they had been compromised. But that there was a cure it had been sent to the backup lab within the center of the ships controls. We donned the robotic exoskeleton suits. But chaos erupted then. Our stocky friend had found us. He bit into the blondes neck who wasn't in her suit yet. I shoved him away, and zipped her the rest of the way up, hoping the suit would be able to heal her. When her suit lights came on they were pink. She had been infected, our lights were blue. She became frenzied and shoved the stocky friend into the wall pummeling him, my other friend and I backed off hoping to escape. She shoved stocky guy into one of the research labs holding glasses for large specimens. As we were leaving she commed our suits and said her suit was holding off the worst of the virus, and that when we found the antidote to comm her. We had no way of trusting her though. 

We were safe in our suits. Mostly ignored as the infected thought we were police robots that hadn't been taken out yet. 

We came upon a truly infected person. One that an imp had gotten. His muscles bulged with pink veins, the whites of hos eyes showed red. He was incredibly violent with a large source of followers that mimed his moves, he immediately knew what we were he told his followers we were being hunted then. The followers let others know. We were able to make it back to the school grounds. But everyone that had been there was disemboweled, naked and in pieces. We left quickly. 

We were able to make it to the center eventually just barely. When we got into the lab, it was pristine and untouched. We started looking for the antidote. We found an entire container from floor to ceiling with it, small pink vials. But the true imp and his followers had found us, our blonde friend in her suit with them. There was a fight, all vials destroyed except one. I shoved it into my friends suit, her lights turned blue. We all fought together. We escaped again and decided to give up. To get to the escape ships and leave. Upon entering them though there was a com waiting for us. 

It said all first wave ships had been infected. That the mission to colonize was failing. All survivors turn back. 

That was mostly the end. It turned and convoluted then. Not following a set pattern as the rest of the dream did. 

Obviously a lot was left out. It gets tiring typing on a phone. It took about an hour to write that out. Woke up feeling anxious. ",new,[Long] Another ongoing intricate dream,1.0

0.0,ar7h2h,0.0,2.0,"Greetings all,

This dream I experienced just a few minutes ago had me up in a sweat and I think it’s one of the best dreams I have had and I am exceptionally curious as to its translation.

First things first - I had a bit of nicotine in my system (I’ve been told stimulants, particulary nicotine, can lead to quite some dreamy trips) and fell asleep to a documentary on the pseudoreligion created by Nazi Germany (the neo-paganist ideologies drafted up by the SS and Heinrich Himmler, not sure if this is pertinent but I figured I’d say so anyways).

This dream I was completely lucid but while experiencing the dream, the dream’s alternate reality replaced my aware reality - I was no longer aware of actual reality.  I thought the dream was the only reality. I didn’t think I was dreaming.

 I was in my house and awoke at my desk, in my chair, where my computer was.  However my desk was not in the same rotational degree as it is in real life.  My computer was missing and my desk was bare save for a white Stratocaster with a coiled input cable plugged into the jack (this guitar I haven’t owned for over a year).  Immediately I was awfully suspicious as to what the hell was going on.  I became insanely terrified for an unknown reason.  Also, it was very late at night.  All the lights in my house were off and I could not turn any lights on.  I would yank at the pull-chords on my lamps, and they would click, but no light.  

So I left my computer room and went into my Dad’s bedroom and tried to wake him up.  I said to him, “Dad, what’s going on? I don’t feel safe.”  I couldn’t speak very well.  When I tried to talk, I was struggling to get out even a sound, as if I was talking after a severe brain injury.  It took immense effort to keep my head up, to keep my eyes open, and it took long seconds to utter words. He merely quipped, “Nothing’s happening, it’s fine.”  For some reason, I had this immense resolve that he was lying through his teeth to me, like he was deceiving me of something he was about to do, or knew of something about to happen that had extreme and malicious intent towards me but I couldn’t figure out what.  He was talking to me with a very apathetic and ever so slight disappointment.

I then hobbled into my bedroom. For some reason I could only walk at a pace of quick hobble.  My bedroom was very dark.  As I made my way over to my nightstand where my lamp was, I made a very weak punch into my dark closet and under my bed in case someone was waiting to ambush me there.  I then tried to turn on my light, but same as in my computer room, just a click and no light.  At this moment I was screaming internally with unabated terror.  I quick-hobbled back into my Dad’s bedroom - I noticed a fluorescent orange hue emanating inside.  His nightstand lamp was glowing damply.  I was more terrified as any light I tried to turn on would not, yet here he was with a working light.  I tried speaking to him again about how I was so terrified and then I heard the door to the garage in our kitchen slam shut from downstairs.  We live alone as Mom passed away six years ago.  

After that, I woke up in a sweat (now back in reality).  It also seemed I had a post dream experience as immediately after I woke up,  it sounded like someone was slowly creeping up the stairs.  I’ve had similar experiences after waking up from weird dreams before - I wake up and have small hallucinations and can’t move (these are very rare and haven’t had one since ~15 years ago).

I’m beginning to wonder if young adults/teenagers are more prone to destructive dreams?

I understand each individual’s psyche and living/work environment is unique to everyone. But when I see a steady pattern of violent dreams in this forum.. it has me wondering what is happening with many folks out there?

My dream started off with me tidying my flat/apartment, before I had to leave for the train. I remember it being a complete mess, and the more I tidied the more trash and dirt appeared. I felt stressed out because I needed to leave ASAP. 

Next my dream cut to a different apartment. My brother is moving to residential halls for university in Sept. and this was a dream about that. We were helping him move in and the whole place seemed really nice and idilic and clean. 

After setting up his room, me, my mum and my brother went to the rugby social club nearby for a drink (which is weird cause my brother/family has 0 interest in rugby). I’m sat looking out of the big floor-ceiling windows when I notice there’s an eclipse. I’m yelling for my mum (who’s on the phone) to come look. She says “that’s not an eclipse” and I notice its huge and getting bigger. In no time its filled up the whole window. People are screaming like rooted to the spot terrified. Then there was a blinding white light and I woke up with my heart pounding and I was drenched in sweat. 

I’m not sure what this dream could mean. Is it maybe because I’ve been suffering a lot with my mental health? Cause I feel like its the end of the world? Or a dream caused by stress?

Im facing my bookcase and see I tarantula scaling the front and immediately start to panic (I do not like spiders).

Lately, my dreams have taken a very weird turn. for context I am at a very stressful time in my life and am severely depressed. I am a straight (or i thought i was) female, who is married to a very doting husband that I love very much.

What has been happening often in these dreams is that I find myself lucid and find a random girl on the street i find attractive and we have sex - but it starts out as me like almost assaulting them? I don't know, I force it to happen, and don't care because i know its a dream and theyre not real, and always, eventually, she gives in and totally falls for me. it's like i'm a succubus or something and i can lure their minds. that sounds more fucked up than it is, i dont have a rape fetish, but its like in the dream in order to take control of another human-like entity to bend to my will, i have to be forceful until the entity is mine for controlling. its like they are their own person with their own wills predetermined in the dream until i become lucid, then i can recreate them to pleasure me.

its like im lucid but i'm not really me (its me but my personality is so sexual)and i've been experiencing at least 3-5 orgasms in my sleep every night. my dreams become so sexual, in a lucid state i absolutely indulge myself into the things i would never do in real life and it all feels amazing.

but other than the sexual stuff, i keep meeting all kinds of people who all have distinct looks to them and clear voices and personalities. it's like im in another realm. i keep hearing music too. a lot of music. and because i know i'm dreaming, and the music isnt anything i recognize, i know its my brain creating my own music. and i make the most beautiful music while i sleep, and the lyrics are always beautiful, but i can never remember them when i wake up. and its so weird because sometimes i'll force myself to wake up just to confirm its not music in the real world, and when i open my eyes, the music literally fades, very slowly, and then i close my eyes again and fall back into the dream, and the music increases again.

I also have been experiencing inception. i will realize i'm in a dream and be like ""alright let's wake up"" and i'll wake up, and go take a shower and get dressed but then randomly, out of no where, i'll lose all equilibrium, which i've learned as a sign that i'm still in the dream. so many times id be in the shower feeling the warmth of it and everything, lose balance, and say ""what the FUCK i'm still asleep???""

I also had a horrid non-lucid dream my father had a heart attack which killed him. then in the dream i jumped through time and space, and my father was alive again, and i was in a white room discovering that what caused the heart attack was a mixture of drinking, and him overworking himself like out in the yard...

so in real life i called him and told him about it and it spooked him. i just asked him to take it easy.

but this has been happening every night and i wake up feeling so fucking weird and i just dont feel ok right now. i want to sleep some more.",new,"Reddit, why have my dreams become so lucid, and so strange?",3.0

What I find most strange about this is I never EVER dream that im myself usually im just a random person etc since I cant picture myself in a dream I guess, Also I never dream of my own house, Usually its just a random place.

It passed by again and the fear returned but this time I could see into the car. There were 4 or 5 people in there and one was a well dressed Man with no face. His hair was white turning yellow.

Alright, so I had a strange dream last night and I think it has to do with my dad going to Mexico by himself. Anyway, the dream starts off with me driving to Mexico from the Midwest US to be with my dad and when I cross the border into Mexico, I stop by a little town and at a stop light someone attempts to jack my car. Well he gets me out of the car somehow and I just start running away but I think I had the keys or something. So I'm running through yards and alleys and stuff with this guy chasing me and I end up at this house's driveway where I think it's safe and I'm far enough away. Well the dude catches up to me and he has a knife and is ready to kill me for my keys. Luckily I have my pocket knife and I bust it out and we have a little knife fight. His goons have made their way to us while we are mid-battle. The guy stabs at me but is unsuccessful and I end up dipping out of the way and behind him and stab him as much as I can in the back and everywhere else I can before he can recover. He turns and slashes my arm. Ouch! He lunges again and I Dodge once again and am able to slash his throat from side to side. He doesn't bleed, he just kinda acknowledges defeat. One of his goons starts coming at me but by this point a woman has come out of the house with a chainsaw, angry that this is happening on her property and proceeds to cut the guy almost in half from the neck down towards his abdomen a la resident evil 4. Many blood. There is a green motorcycle in the alley and I hop on it and make my escape. I drive away and after a while end up at another little town. This time, I am stopped by a tall lanky guy who is trying to steal my bike. He does something to make me wipe out and runs away when I recover quickly and go to beat him up. I find him in this restaurant, hiding under a table. I pull him out and start beating him senseless. I have nearly pounded his face in when two big muscle heads come at me and try to fight me at the same time. I am too quick for their slow powerful blows and am able to dodge and counter every time but with little effect. This goes on for a few minutes and I tell them I will take them one by one and if they have any honor, they will oblige.

Once the kids left, my mother, who seems to be nonchalantly aware of what is happening but did nothing to stop it, brings me a cup of water and some medicine. I hear two men talking in a nearby hallway, but I am either not supposed to or unable to move from my current position. A man wearing some color T-Shirt comes out an asks me to go with him. When I did not comply, the man yelled and dragged me across the floor. Going down a hallway, we eventually make a right turn into a bathroom, where a man with a cowboy hat is waiting with papers in his hand.

This happened over ten years ago. My family and I were at a reunion of sorts, which we took in *Ȟe Sápa* (Pahasapa a.k.a. the Black Hills) at rental cabins. A few of us were up late enjoying a beautiful starry night. We were talking about the ""deep state"" and whether a satellite signal could be faked by high altitude balloons, bouncing groundwaves off the ionosphere and other mysteries of technology, such as the ability to now fabricate personalities in the news without most people being able to tell it's a sim or digital face alteration. Totally speculative. Not raving or anything, just kind of with a sense of wonder. We all went to bed. I stayed on an upper floor with a tiny square window above the head of the bed so I could still see the night, and it was so pleasant I conked out.

&#x200B;

**The dream**

I was having a great time with friends (from RL) in my dream. We were on a road trip and we stopped in a city. We were just about to decide where to go, the day felt pregnant with potential when a portable phone on me buzzes insistingly. I didn't actually own a phone in real life and this dream one didn't belong to me either, and they knew it. Suddenly my friends acted really cowed and looked at me like I'd better answer this but they didn't want to have anything to do with it.

I take this thing out of my pocket and it was one of those old blocky things with a little 1.5"" square screen. A very eerie light quality like I'd never seen before in any dream was coming from this screen. So I lift it up to look and there is a text rant and it says

*The only people who care about reforming government are in UCLA and they are ineffective*

It just felt like this weird demoralizing attack from a cubicle worker who needed to shame me.

&#x200B;

**Research**

I woke up, and it was still dark. In my drowsy state I looked out the square window for some reason, as if it were a signal broadcast from outside the cabin and just tried to glimpse the stars through the mosquito screen. It was such an icky feeling and felt so ""outside"" me that later in the morning when more people were up I told them about it.

My extended family is generally liberal and is often talking about support of the Democratic party. So pretty middle of the road people without paranoia about big government. One older relative said with absolutely no stress or fear in their voice, just matter of factly, ""I have been wondering if someone has the ability to do that for years. I started reading about something that invasive in the 70s and it concerned me back then.""

For peace of mind, I have decided this is probably just a weird dream. So I tried to see if my subconscious was telling me something. At first I looked up the ACLU (hadn't heard much of UCLA) before finding a page about the University of California, Los Angeles. The only thing I could find about UCLA is that it looks like an ordinary school sort of near Hollywood. I don't know why my subconscious (or whatever) decided to tell me about UCLA, claim it's the last bastion of progressive reform or what any of this was about. I just wanted to have a nice dream about enjoying the company of friends and I felt totally trolled by a cynical attitude that I don't even have about politics that I don't feel invested in and had nothing to do with the rest of the dream.

It's so hard to describe...I wish I typed this out sooner. I can imagine the ending well though so hopefully that helps. I think the main character or one of them just ends up doing a sort of day to day job repearing the massive kind of satellites you'd find in the desert, kind of like the outback I guess, orange and completely flat for miles. He drives all the way out into the desert in a rusty looking van with loads of sort of... customisation over it, blankets and grills and paints and all the works, a real rust bucket, it looks like it would break down any moment. Even the camera work is only from the side and above so you can really feel how far out into the desert he has droven in a straight line. I don't think I dreamt any work but when he was done he just started into the hot blue sky for a little while and sighed, he waved somebody at the satellite sight goodbye and just drived straight back for miles and miles in a straight line again. It was actually incredibly sad. I think either said character used to be out in space or that his brother and maybe friends died or are lost in space.

----

The moment I went to bed I was completely conscious of the process of falling asleep, the first image that popped in my mind as I fell asleep was a forest. It was bright daylight and it was autumn.

The moment I saw the forest and also noticed I could walk in there, hearing the sounds of the leaves as I made my way. I only took a few steps at this point and the first thing that came to mind was: ""Hey, this isn't where I'm supposed to be, so this must be a dream"".

It's been a while since I had my last lucid dream, so I did what I had to do, which was grounding: Standing still, and taking it all in. It'll make the dream even more vivid.

I then saw 2 dogs running. These 2 dogs were my old dogs (here's some pics: https://photos.app.goo.gl/ajBLyVxBbwbhjKPLA and https://photos.app.goo.gl/Vie2Nb6dQ7AtSzZa9) who are long gone already.

I ran after them and eventually we found a fence and they ran as hard as they can. I tried to scream after them: ""Don't do it! You can't climb this high you will break your legs!"". They did it anyway and both of them managed to jump over it. It's hard to explain what I saw but it was surprisingly well-done. It was kinda like this: https://youtu.be/NNfm0mo0y18?t=29

When they were on the other side, they turned around and looked at me with a really hopeful expression. As if they were to say: ""It's up to you now, don't mess it up"".

The strangest thing happened. The dogs ran away, and the planet started to shrink. Heavily. The whole thing. It shrunk to about 99% if I'm not mistaken. You could literally take a walk around the earth in a single day.

During the ""shrinking process"" I fainted and woke up again on a big, flat grassy field. I looked around and saw nothing but the tiny planet, some grass, a small hut, and a book sitting on a rock.

When I looked over again I saw 3 creatures who were sort of blue blobs with fur that killed themselves as I woke up. I started to lose lucidity at this point but was still able to deal with things with logic.

I walked to the book: It had a red cover with this title in golden letters: ""Perfect World"". The author was at the bottom of the cover: ""Aldous Huxley"".

I opened the book and started to read the first chapter. I read something in the lines of: ""First we had to get rid of everyone in the Animalia-kingdom"" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal).

""That doesn't make any sense,"" I thought. ""Humans are animals too and I'm still here, besides we also have these weird furred blobs that were at least alive when I got here"".

I decided to continue reading: ""The world needs to be accessible to anyone like Google earth, "" (refers to the shrinking).

""Software rules this planet, Microsoft facilitates the people with the necessities"". Ouch. I put the book away and went to the small hut.

I walked inside and there was a bed, 3 plants on the window and a small kitchen with 3 bowls of vegetables on the counter. Obviously, since there were no animals, there was no meat too. The bed had a blanket with the Microsoft logo all over.

I then realized that this was a somehow big deal. ""Holy shit this book is a bible to a new world!"". I looked up and asked: ""Tell me what I have to do!"".

His hands looked like talons, except like ragged shattered glass shards. The same go with his feet. He also had long wild spikes that sprouted from the back of his neck. They were a tar shiny black and looked like they would cut you.
I drop my wood and start backing up and it starts moving toward me. I was scared of what he was going to do, but all he did was pick up the wood and start a fire for me. He slowly backed up after he was done and watched me as I warily sat down by the fire. As I sat down though I wound back up inside. 
This time I immediately start walking again. My trip was shorter as I went through the doors and rooms I came across when with triplets inside of it. I could see them but it didn't seem like they could see me. I reavhed out to touch ones hair and as that happened a wave of sadness rushed over me, my hear renches in my chest and I'm now back outside. 

This is when I wake up and the dream ends. I don't know what this was supposed to mean but the fact that I was told that ""they decide wether you go to Hell, Heaven or to a world"" and then I wake up when I go outside the second time scares the shit out of me.

I don't know, maybe I'm reading into something too much that could be a harmless nightmare. But like I said, I don't remember dreams this vividly unless I have it frequently.

I was in a house that was mine but I didn’t recognize it. The layout was different than mine except the second bathroom was in the same place. It had a large front yard that had many pathways leading down a hill wheee the street was. Someone was feuding with my husband and kept coming/sending people to try and harm my family/destroy the house. Of course we were unable to get through to 9-11 and when I tried to fire my gun at the intruders it was jammed. The only thing that did work was when I kept finding knives. The first I pulled out of the kitchen, but I got a second when someone brought it in with them, and I could defend myself with the knives. As the dream progressed instead of stopping people as they tried to break in, stabbing them would turn them undead but they would be on my side after. They ended up hurting my puppy but just said “ it’s ok- she can live forever after this.”

Well this reminds me that this happened to me one time in a dream.

It was a long dream which was culminating in me driving a simple little car like an Escort or Civic and feeling pretty damn thrilled about it (a frequent dream theme for some reason) but in this particular dream I wound up driving very close to a real life lake (Lake Harriet in Minneapolis for those that know it) during a flash flood.

Well nobody is stupid enough to be doing this but for some reason I am thinking, ""We gotta get outta here, I'm going to drive us higher"" and I have to hit an intersection that is completely flowing in two or three feet of water now, whatever is almost to the level of the hood.

I will remember this moment because my normally vivid dreams normally do not have problems delivering the graphics, they are just nuts with vivid things that would take megacomputers some time to ""render"" if simulated by animation. But for some reason when the front end of the car hit that water, it was like the car just stopped in motion and the crest of water I hit froze.

There was a second or two where passengers were like, ""Uh, this doesn't seem like a good idea"" and I said/thought, ""No just give it a second"" and sure enough, time outside the vehicle ""unfroze"" and a most beautiful cascading effect flowed around the car and we pushed through the water as if the vehicle gained an upper hand over the deluge.

As I was admiring this awesome flow of water I woke up, almost like my dream just said, ""Nope, you're done. You're just enjoying the view now and you don't even care about your plight.""

So that's my story. Had dream lag. I guess maybe my imagination just *didn't know how* to render the water for a couple seconds because it was a really complex physics? But idk",new,"Dream lagged, FPS dropped to 0",2.0

Let me give you some back story first. So for the longest time my cousin “Paige” and my friend “Becca” were really close. We lived near each other and we were just great friends. But Becca and Paige were best friends. Eventually as we got older, the two got into a fight and essentially they’re not friends anymore now. Paige pretty much abandoned us, especially Becca.

Now me and Becca are pretty much best friends. We tell each other everything and we know everything about each other. And now that time has passed we still miss the old times, but we’re happy with how close the two of us have gotten. 

But last night I had a dream. I was outside of a house in the freezing cold. There was snow all over the ground. It was Paige’s house. I was freezing, but I saw someone come to the door. It was Becca and she told me to come inside. The house was dark and there were no lights. The only people inside were me and Becca. Paige was nowhere to be seen which was really weird since it’s her house. So I said to Becca “What’s going on?”  And she just broke into tears. And she looked up at me and said “This isn’t real”.

I don’t even recall using the machine at all in the dream, but I managed to win it, plus another super cool and weird electric guitar. Whatta score! 

I took the guitars from it’s case to check them out, Elvis’ was worn out, I flipped it over to see the signature signed by the king of rock himself, and written in large capital sharpie,

“**THE LITERAL KING**”.

All of a sudden I start to see thousands of planes fly over the city as if they were invading.  But I was the only one who could see these planes because my mom kept asking me what I was seeing.  Before I know it, the whole city is literally upside down from my perspective.  It was like everything was flipped except for me, the buildings protruded from the sky downward and there were giant tornadoes coming from the bottom upward where the buildings used to be.  For whatever reason I knew it was Armageddon and echoed this to my mother.

It seemed to be day time in the amusement section and night time in the apartment section. I started the dream being afraid of a man I did not know. He was accompanied by what seemed to be his wife pushing a stroller. He had a shot gun that seemed to be filled with water that was able to hit targets across the park. He aimed it at our group of ladies and had hit one of them. Instantly she started feeling woozy and insisted on taking a hot shower. We walked up to one of the apartment units on the 3rd floor and found a room giving a presentation of some sort. They were presenting something that I had written before (while awake) and made it seem like some kind of conspiracy. The lady goes to take a shower, and never starts it. I looked inside and she was hunched over in the bath, dead from whatever hit her. Another lady comes in and sees, then started screaming. I knew the man would have heard the scream so I ran for it.

Instead I ran back the way I came and into another unit to tell people what I saw. In the room were the two ladies I was with in the beginning, my brother, my mom, and the man I was running from. One lady was still weak from whatever hit her earlier, and was obviously terrified. Everyone was sitting around a table, and seemed to be waiting for further instructions from the man. He handed us all cups filled with a clear liquid and expected us to drink them. A moment of silence passed as we all didn't want to, then my brother goes and shoves something up the man's nose (haha) which gave us (the ladies) enough time to run and hide.

I looked down at my hands, and thought, “I’m awake!”. I looked around me, thinking about where to go. I’m in a suburban area, in the middle of the night; there’s snow everywhere and streetlights are on. I decide to run around, just because I actually CAN run around and felt really free at that aspect. I run until I see a beautiful White House, with green trim. It was illuminated, and looked so warm and inviting. All the lights were on; it reminded me of a warm house on a cold Christmas night. I run to the house, and in front of the house (on a porch table) there is a lantern. There’s this beautiful illuminating light coming from it, but there was frost all around it. I decide to pick up the lantern, and it is cold. I mean, cold. I felt the cold on my hands, in my dream. 

I can’t stop thinking about this dream; the realness of it, me being absolutely convinced that I was awake (a realizing within the dream), making the decision to run around/ go towards that particular house, feeling the coldness, and also feeling that this was a real place in real time (since it was night time, and there’s currently lots of snow since it’s winter).

Almost every time I have a dream that i remember (which lately has been about once a week, sometimes it's more frequent) it's a nightmare about being kidnapped. It's never the same captors, I'm never held in the same place. I've been kidnapped by doctors/scientists, psych wards, hillbillies (for lack of a better word), average seeming people. A few times it has been people who have physically hurt/traumatized me in the past, but the vast majority is by strangers. 

In most my dreams I'm not the only one kidnapped. Sometimes it's other strangers, the random girl in the basement with me, a group of other 'patients' being tested on, once it was my own mom who was captured after trying to save me. Yesterday it was my ex girlfriend from like 9+ years ago, who i don't have any remaining feelings for or contact with, but in my dream i did.  We had just rekindled our relationship when we were both abducted.

The reason why i mention that is because I think these other people add a new element to the dream. I feel responsible to help these people, I feel connected to them and I want to help them as much as I want to help myself, but more often than not I fail to save them. Sometimes I wake up mourning these people who never existed, hating myself for leaving them behind when I got the option to save myself. There's a lot of guilt when I feel like it was my fault they were kidnapped or when I leave them behind, which happens fairly often, although usually after several failed attempts at saving us both.

Another element that may be important is that in every dream there's at least one instance, but usually several, where I almost escape, only to be dragged right back again. Sometimes I escape the facility, nearly get to my parent's home (I'm an adult with my own home and family, but in my dreams I always run to my childhood home) or go to another public place like a mall or store, and they find me right before I can ask for help or get inside the house. Sometimes the captures are so confident in their abilities I am allowed to go to the store for them, but no one helps or hears me if I ask. Sometimes I'm kidnapped again by someone completely different.

I've never been kidnapped before or known anyone that has. Sorry this was so long.",new,Reoccuring dreams about being kidnapped,1.0
0.0,aqmifx,3.0,2.0,"I just had a kind of a nightmare last night. I dreamed I was in a brand new house and it was sort of a dorm with all my old netball teammates and our head of the house was my old netball coach. For some reason I had lost my tempure in the kitchen and screamed at the coach. She then turned angry but like the angry where you sort of have a smile and laugh, that psycho one in horror movies. I got scared and ran outside and she caught me. She than started pushing me to the ground and saying “your dad saved my life(he didn’t irl) it’s a shame his daughter acts like this, now I have to beat you”. She went away for a bit and came back with a baseball bat. But somehow she had change to a man who I don’t know but he was white with tattoos on his arm (my coach is a brown woman) . Still maintaining a laughing manner he said ‘your going to take this beating for what you’ve done’ or something like that. So I tried to escape but for some reason the lock on the front gate was one of those old farm gate locks-
[here’s a picture of it](https://i.pinimg.com/236x/2f/d0/b0/2fd0b0c331f6a1f022b8cb8f86525ccf.jpg)
And I had trouble unlocking it fast enough and when I did unlock it he had caught up to me by then and dragged me back to where I was before he then said this very clearly and I remember it because as soon as I woke up i wrote it down it was such a weird thing. He said “you’re going to take this beating and the neighbours are going to think you’re getting slashed by slash from AC/DC”. Such a weird thing to say right. Then he went on to say stuff along the lines of “you will have cuts and bruises and wounds”. Then I started begging and saying like “please don’t beat me I learned my lesson I won’t ever do that again” and I started trying to grab the bat off of him. He was too strong though and I couldn’t grab it. He then turned away to go back inside because I think he needed to do something before he beat me and I tried running away. Again I had trouble with that stupid lock and he noticed I was trying to escape but he kept smiling and walked slowly towards me. I don’t remember what happened after that I just woke up. I hope I escaped though.

It’s such a weird dream because I’ve never been a victim of any type of physical abuse. And my coach never really got mad at me or scared me in the way, she was the type to put on a smile or laugh when she was mad though so I can give her that. Her changing into a man was weird too. For some reason I keep picturing him as that guy from vine Curtis Lepore now that I think about the dream ,I have no idea why he came to mind i really haven’t seen his face since when he use to make awful vines. but I don’t know it could be any white guy with tattoos on his arm. And the reason I said it was kind of a nightmare is because I didn’t wake up sweating or with a thumping heart or anything. I just woke up normal-ish.

0.0,aqlohf,0.0,2.0,"I am a time traveler on board the Titanic on the night of it’s sinking with my fiance, Amber. The ship is already sinking when the dream begins, and I remember being on deck with Amber, and wondering, with significant fear, if there were any boats left. Amber and I begin walking toward the stern as it begins to lift into the air. It is at a relatively soft 15 degree angle by the time we get anywhere close to the stern. Before we get there, I think “what are we going to do at the stern except wait to sink and freeze to death, we have to go try to find a boat” and direct Amber to come back toward the middle of the deck with me. We find one boat, which I remember my subconscious mind had determined was one of the “collapsible” lifeboats, which were more flimsy and less reliable, but it was empty. We started to get into the boat, but I realized I did not know how to operate the hoist mechanism, so I determined that we needed to find an officer. We found an officer standing by the hoist mechanism, and began to beg him to help us get onto the boat. He kept his back turned to us for several tries, until he eventually turned around angrily at our prodding, pointing his gun at us, and demanding that we leave him alone. Next thing I remember, we were in the boat in the water. But rather than being a life boat, the sides had somehow turned up with our weight, and it was more of a cup with barely enough room for both of us, and with very high sides. The laws of physics were intact in my subconscious mind, because we were having significant trouble keeping the “cup” upright, and it eventually turned sideways. Amber fell out and I remember trying to help her back into the boat, and at one point I fell into the water myself. I remember thinking “at least we’re alive, we can stay in the sideways boat until we’re rescued and we’ll be fine.” I do not remember actually getting Amber back into the cup, though. Next thing I remember, I am in the boat, and am approaching a land mass, where the other lifeboats have docked and people are standing on the shore, awaiting rescue. I remember being very relieved that we were on land and had survived. The level of light(dull, golden light with a tinge of purple to the sky) seems to indicate it is either early morning or late evening. The land is hard-caked mud and there is an old dilapidated wooden structure, and the wood is dark, wet, and weak, not a building, more like a barn without roof or walls. I am having small talk with some of the survivors and trying to climb an old ladder up to a loft area, just for fun. I remember being happy at this point of the dream, being intrigued with the character of this period of time and the novelty of being in 1912, exploring a structure that is already old, and imagining what it may have been, and moreso, being happy that I was alive. The other survivors begin indicating that rescue(at this time I don’t remember if the nature of the rescue is a land vehicle or another ship, or if i ever knew) is near, and at this time, it dawns on me that Amber is not with me. I think I had been believing that she was somehow coming, but now I begin to wonder by what avenue I believed her to be coming from, given that the last time I saw her was in the water, and now I can’t even remember ever helping her back into the boat, and believe that I simply left her. At this point, I became very frightened. Next scene, I am walking in a small town with multiple shoppes. I remember being, again, intrigued by the novelty of being in 1912. The other survivors are happily buzzing in and out of the shoppes. I remember that the scene reminded me of a museum I visited once, wherein there was a long, curving path where the time period of the surroundings gradually evolved from early 20th century to “future”. I recall thinking that this was like that, only on a larger and more “real” scale. However, all of this novelty is dwarfed by my concern over Amber, and that concern is becoming more and more great the further we walk from the shore, and the longer I go without seeing her. I wonder if I will find her among the throngs of other survivors in the shoppe area, and wonder, if she were still in the water and had somehow got out, would she be able to find us? Next scene. I am on a bus with the other passengers, riding toward home, we are driving through a desert. I realize that Amber must have been left in the water and that I will never see her again, and that i may be lost/stuck in this time period. I get out of my seat and kneel in the aisle and begin to sob. I wake up.

Last night I experienced that for the first time. Warning, this dream is really messed up and long, I have no idea what my brain was thinking last night but this was terrifying. 

So I was with an old friend of mine. We were walking down the street, and I was talking about getting a job at a convenience store. I said that I applied for the job, but my friend said he applied and was rejected. I told him he could apply for a job at one of the stores next to it, like the pizza shop, so I could see him on my break. 

We were suddenly at the group of stores I was talking about, and he went in for a job interview for the pizza shop. I was waiting on the curb, in the shade of some trees next to the parking lot. As I was waiting, I heard the sound of a large machine on the other end of the parking lot. 

This is where it got messed up. 

I saw my friend’s body in this machine. He wasn’t moving or saying anything, and I was frozen in place. Part of the machine was wrapped around his head, like a crown thing with spikes. I watched them close around his head, and remove the top part of his head completely. The rest of his body disappeared, while I watched them place his scalp and brains in a parking spot near the shop. The worst part, was that I could hear the squish of his brain as they moved it around.  I couldn’t move or say anything, I was so scared. His brains looked so jelly-like. There wasn’t a whole lot of blood but I was still disgusted and disturbed. 

I considered calling 911, but I was scared the people who killed him could see me from the window so I decided I was going to just walk away and pretend like I didn’t care. 

As I was walking, I got further away from the shop but I slowly realized I was lost and I had no way of contacting anyone because my phone had no signal. I got to this really scary part of town. There was this gang at the end of the street, and they were all shaky and weird, as if they were on drugs. They all had long messy grey hair, and they looked like they were all in their 50s. 

I’m not sure why, but I approached them anyway, despite knowing they were bad. As I approached, I heard them talking about eating dog meat? And I noticed they were carrying crossbows. I got scared and decided to turn around, but one of them took a swing at me with their bow, just hitting my back but not hurting me. I turned around and I suddenly saw my cousin walking down the sidewalk with a girl I didn’t know. I called out for her and she smiled and was really happy to see me.

Things change a little, we're in the art room of the same school, this time it's a class and I'm not revisiting school; it's a full on class. My bully is there and I sit next to him, things get fuzzy around these moments, a lot of parts get fuzzy but I'm trying my hardest to remember. I remember he was insulting me and I was getting violent, my teacher was backing him up so at some point, I grabbed something and tried to hurt both the teacher and my bully, but everything I did was completely ineffective, like as if I was too weak to hurt them. Weirdly enough, I would never do things like that, I'm not really violent, I'm not lucid in this dream. Please keep this in note because I don't understand a lot of the weird intricacies of what's going to happen next.

In the dream, I was fighting with my parents about something seemingly insignificant. My mom had some pictures of mine, but she was selling whatever they were stored in (which I guess means she was getting rid of all the pictures?). It was a terrible fight, like I’ve literally never actually had a fight this bad with them. By the end of the argument, I somehow got the pictures, and was sitting at the breakfast bar looking at the pictures while my parents openly talked about getting in contact with someone to sue me like I wasn’t even there. 

As I was looking at the pictures, only one picture was in focus. It was a picture of a lady who passed away in November. I honestly wasn’t very close to her, but she definitely had a mentorship role in my life. That’s when I woke up crying. 

I thought I had mourned her death already, so I don’t know if my waking up crying was a sign of repressed grief, or if I was crying because of the fight with my parents.

This probably is a long shot. I’ve been spending too much time on Reddit 

I had a dream I was at this weird strip mall? Not like the usual mall I visit. I tried on these expensive inflatable pants that made me feel like I was walking on a cloud/flying. 

Anyways in the dream I “woke up” and there was a post in this subreddit about everyone dreaming about this. So we were all just trying to piece this weird dream together. We figured all the background people at the strip mall was each other. My contribution was “did  everyone’s dream last night take place down south (mid west) despite never been to the south, mid day to mid evening?”

So did you?

Hello everyone. I am reposting this from r/witchcraft since this seems to be a more suitable subreddit.

I had one of the most vivid dreams full with symbols. I think the dream was supposed to address these fears, not symbolize that they are to come true (fears related to work-life balance and health issues).

In the dream we were looking for a house to buy, exploring the countryside with my husband. There was a wide river which run along the road and it was full with strength, unstoppable (this is a best description of the impression I got from the river).

At some point we were crossing a bridge and I saw that water is so pure that I can see the bottom of the river so clearly as if there was no water at all (a good sign?). We explored the area more and then found a house, which we decided to settle in.

Near the house there was a stream which separated from the river and run through a forest. I was walking bare-feet along the stream and there were walnuts everywhere on the ground. I picked one up and tasted it and it was so delicious (I made a comment to my husband about how fruitful this forest is). As I walked further I noticed pomegranate seeds in the grass and as I looked up I saw pomegranates on the tree. I started to look for some fruits hanging lower, which I could reach and I found some, but as I have reached for them they all turned into red apples. An animal approached me from the woods. First I was afraid, but then I started to fondle it only to realize it is a unicorn (shocker, I know, user name checks out). As I fondled it I heard my dog barking from the distance, as I have left it home.

My alarm rang.

Overall I think this dream was a good omen. I was a bit concerned about the dog barking at the end. Also, I have performed a spread with my tarot cards to maybe understand the meaning better and became a bit worried if pomegranates turning into apples might mean that I will have problems with fertility \[Reversed Ten of cups\], but then again, it is quite possible my cards just illustrated my fears.

What do you all think?

Ok here's the dream


I was in my garage on my bed (I sleep I  the garage my bed is on a pool table, I like it out there because it's almost like camping during the day I keep the garage open and go about my work etc I like being outside.) 
Laying on my bed I'm straight chillin. Then 2 owls catch my eye as they land on my moms car who is parked right in front of the garage. One owl is white the other is black, the white one stayed in the back almost like it was just keepin check. The black owl was huge and sturdy. It was looking me straight in the eye it had like golden eyes. 

We got into a little bit of a staring contest... honestly it was more me in awe and it watching to see what I would do.  

Now I dont know why I did it but at the height of this stillness I did this like rahhhh to give it a jump scare maybe get it to leave idk 

But immediately almost like it was waiting for me to do this it like pounced on me almost like a black panther and I just remember being pinned down hand over my head and it started chanting something to me In a language I did not understand.

Now I was raised in a Christian house so my innate training  came out but rather than saying I rebuke you in the name of jesus I just started saying I plead the blood of jesus over me my family etcetc while I was saying this and while it was saying g something to me I could almost see myself surrounded by this like electric gold light... the last word I heard from. What it was saying g was SA...

but somehow i managed to quit. its good. but the sleep paralyse now seems like the joke compared with the dreams i have since more than a month.

now i want to share my last dream because that was the probably the weirdest i had. maybe someone lacks of nigtmares and needs a free one : /

the dream was, as allways in parts which are indirectly connected.

it starts with me and the guys from work, at a table. someone tries to explain us how we have to  bandage our wounds if we would get injured.
thats nothing unusal for me since we have lot of emergency courses each year.
also my son is there. he doesnt fit in the scene  because he is 7. whatever. i try to help him bandage someones imaginary wound. 

next scene i try to fix a IT-problem (i guess) with one guy from work. i say something like, let me try, i'll figure it out but i need time.
the guy starts to get angry, yells: you allways need time and do shit you don't know nothing about. we need a professional. i feel deeply insulted, and push him away, he chokes me, we start to have something like a fight, but still laughing for short moments. i tell him to stop, because he is a active military guy (special forces) and he could easily kill me. he agrees. we keep talking and walk together away. while we walk every step the guy takes he almost gets killed by a accident: a car almost hits him, then a metal rod, a helicopter or something. i think he is  ridiculously lucky! we talk and walk.

we reach some building like a warehouse, it looks old. rusty, it has corrugated iron doors, like a big garage door. he enters, i follow him, but now we both see people running out of the building, laughter and frighting yelling is hearable. 

i see how some kid like creatures run afther them. they make weird noises. a evil smile is on their face, their skin looks wasted, old. they talk with weird voice like a deep tuned vocoder effect and giggle and sometimes repeat some words which i don't understand at this moment. 

we start also to run away, because we see how this creatures do something with the people they catch. 
those who are catched by them turn also to such creatures and start to act the same.
i'm scared, fear for my life. 
as we run away i see how some people go against this creatures with weapons who look like those from ghostbusters but mainly red and yellow colored and the nozzle looks very narrow, like the mouth part of a shisha. but it doesnt shoot, they have to touch the creatures with the nozzle and press the trigger which seems not easy because the creatures are fast. at least faster than them. people lose the fight. we run.

scene change: im not arround. i see how a clique of juveniles stand together between blocks of flats. they talk. the view turn circles arround them, like in a movie scene and goes closer.
i hear what they talk. one seems to be the leader of the group. a short and black haired girl with a leather jacket. she says something like she fears that it could be the last time they are together because shit hit the fan. whatever is happening, its not good and it looks like the end is near.

scene change: i'm back in this street where the creatures bust running people, i'm scared again. don't know what this previous scene was, and think to myself if that is a game (wherever this thought comes frome)
i see that almost everyone turned in to those creatures. i run.
i take one of this weird guns who lay arround everywhere, and try to defend myself.

creature people run against me,i touch them with the nozzle and press the trigger. i manage to defend my self, but not long enough.
the are to much of them and i can't shoot that fast. i am surrounded. i realize that i have lost. i fear to die. my last thought in this moment is: ok. its over. you have die now.

one of the creatures kills me.
i turn to one of them. try to talk. my voice changed, ...

scene goes black.

new scene fades in. everything is black.

the view flies over a horde of ceatures who amstand arround one creature that obviously is the leader, the king of them. the view(cam?) flies over the horde and goes in to the head of the leader. i realise in this moment, im woke again. i am this leader. i am the king of this creatures.

a feeling of peace goes thru my mind. its ok. that is what it had to be. 
i had to become one of them. because i am their king. they wanted me to come back(?)...

scene fades black again.
i am , but nowhere. my view then gots centered to some beautiful, light blue shining, organic, wobbling and selfexpanding structure. it grows. its like its alive.
but another structure, like blue blood vessels is wrapped arround it. this other structure also grows arround this thing. it looks like it tries to cover the whole light blue shining wobbling thing.

 a unhearable voice tellls me that i have to destroy the blood vessel structure and have to free the wobbling other thing.

in this moment i realize that the scene from before, with the creatures and me as the king didn't stop. that this is just the second part of it, and this interdimensional war keeps going. my purpose is to save this thing, thats why i had to become the king again. while this goes thru my mind, i hear the words which the creatures from before were repeating all the time. now it repeats forever in my mind: naga naga naga naga ........


i wake up. my bed is wett from all my sweating, my mind is woke like i had a line of cocain a second before. naga? WTF does that mean.

i google it.

its a snake god from the hindu religion.

This is a section of a slightly longer dream, the events that happened before went into this. Basically me and my sister were rushing to get ready and leave for a bus. Then the next thing I know we're at home again and she tells me that we didn't end up catching it. In my dream I noted that I must have been really tired since I don't remember this. (I think I may have felt tired in the dream?) Then I'm venting and arguing about this to my mother when suddenly a second version of her pops up. She's literally stood there while a copy of her stands 5 ft away, both of them in front of me. I start to panic and try to tell real her but she has no reaction, just looked concerned from what I remember. Then my attention turned to the copy as she started to walk towards me. All of a sudden my real mother is gone and the copy is acting normally instead of the weird state the copy was in before. She's acting like my mother but I knew she wasn't, something was off to me about her tone and what she said. The little she said when I interacted with her seemed to be obvious to me, not like how my actual mother speaks. I ended up saying goodnight and stealing some kind of tissue she had at her seat (I don't know why now but in the dream this had importance that I take it). Then as I try to walk away with the tissue in my pocket I woke up with the same sense if dread and sinking feeling I had in my dream. After being awake for thirty minutes writing this the feeling is still there.

I didn't recognize any of them except my Closest male friend and my crush of 5ish years. My crush and I were talking about some movie where a guy steals a bunch of money, then somehow multiplies that money by seven, and then returns the money he stole, keeping the rest to theirself. My crush asked me what would I do in that situation, I said I'd probably do the same, return what I stole and keep the rest, as oppose to keep it all. She then replied with ""what a wonderful man you are, I'd marry you right now"" I got flustered in my dream and somehow forced a wink at her. After I winked, she said ""you wish"" and then immediately looked up along with everyone else who was at my house.

Some of my worst nightmares include ones where I’m cannibalized and tortured by my own parents, received deep chemical burns and upon walking around the hospital found tortured children with all their limbs cut off and severe burns, watching others being skinned alive and then getting skinned alive myself, being tied up and dragged across a parking lot until severe road rash has occurred, seeing kids commit suicide, etc. 
I also recently had a dream that was very blunt and I was basically told that if I don’t control who I share my interests with, I will end up committing suicide, with a very graphic depiction of that before awakening.

How do I stop these dreams? I don’t mind the mild nightmares as much because I’ve gotten used to them (and can even appreciate the creativity of them), but I don’t think I can EVER adjust to these. My dreams are VERY vivid and I can feel everything that happens in them. It’s painful  and scarring.

0.0,aqf8k7,2.0,4.0,"In this dream I and an IRL friend named Lili where climbing up the floors of a 100-floor dungeon. Each floor was different in layout, and some threat was created at complete random on each floor. We entered the next floor, which looked like the sanctuary of the old mosaic church, a wide, open room mostly in black, with hundreds of chair positioned in front of a large stage, with two small rooms storing more chairs in each back corner of the room. When we stepped through the door, weird wires became visible all around the room, with some dark blue-purplish energy coming from them. (the dream began on floor 50) and an image appeared in each of our vision, like UI in a video game. It cycled through nearly infinite possibilities, before settling on an image of a Rathalos from Monster Hunter. I heard a distant roar and drew a sword that looked a lot like the Buster sword from Final Fantasy, but smaller, and I forget what weapon Lili had. It suddenly was inside the room, but it didn’t teleport in or walk through the walls, I can't explain how it was there. It charged at us, I attempted to block it, and Lili backed up and attacked it (I couldn’t say how, as I don't recall her weapon) it charged straight towards me and I was slammed into the wall (which seemed to be taken from this time I was thrown against a wall in karate class). I felt some weird imitation of pain, it was like I could feel the pain, but it was distant, more like me understanding that I was in pain, if that makes any sense. It turned and charged for Lily, and I jumped up and hit it. It had seemingly no effect. I blank on the specifics of a lot more of the dream, but basically, after little more fight, it had us both crawling on the ground bleeding out. We were crawling into the back room, I was in intense “pain”. The Rathalos was storming around behind us, knocking stuff over. We looked at each other with an idea (not a very rational one but dreams just screw up your brain like that). We kept crawling, trying to hide under a bunch of chairs stored in that room (likely inspired by the fact that I would often do this as a kid when playing hide and seek or tag after service). The room was small though, really small, and the dream versions of us were really dumb (or delusional from blood loss). We kept climbing over one another trying to make it under the chairs, but then I turned around. The Rathalos saw us and stomped towards us. We climbed even faster, trying to get under the chairs. It stuck his head in and roared, watching us frantically climb away, taunting us with our fates. It stuck it’s foot inside, and I woke up right as I “felt” the pain of being crushed.

So i was just laying down on my couch watching TV, This dream actually showed my house in such detail that it felt so damn real. It was night time and i saw a something move through my window, I paid it no mind but after a few hours it went up my window and chased me, I was scared shitless. It wasn't the fact that im scared of snakes it was just that the dream looks and feels so real and the fact that the snake looked so horrifyingly disproportional! It looks too small to be a snake, It has feathers on it which looked like it was forced to stick on it, And the eyes are like gouged out and it's tail is similar to a rattlesnake's except made of like human skin it's disgusting, It has bits of it cut off, You could see it's insides! I ran off my house and for a brief moment i saw a shadow like man ( smiling? ) in our kitchen when i looked back my house, The streets looked so in detail it feels so real. I saw an old lady which is one of our neighbours. I asked for her help, Told her the details and when she saw the snake, I was surprised that she didn't even felt scared for one bit. I asked if she could step on it, She did. It was still alive after that, So i stepped on it instead. I stepped too hard and it's head exploded everywhere. After that it died. But the old lady was acting so weird, She didn't act like a normal person, It also felt awfully quiet which usually it wouldn't be at the time this dream was in, Which was around 10:20PM when i looked. I heard no cars, No tvs, No people talking, It felt too scary real. After that i woke up, Which was the normal part because i usually wake up for some reason when a dream ends and then i go back to sleep again.

In all of my dreams this has gotta be the realest. I swear every single detail in this dream is so real. Even the streets, It felt so real.

A pretty Asian woman stayed too. She had shoulder length black hair that she had curled, bangs, brown eyes, pale skin, and glasses with thin, round, silver frames. A short sleeve, button up, white shirt, black shorts, and black shoes. She was short and thin. She told told me that she was a Ravenclaw, and it was such a Ravenclaw thing that we were doing. I said I was a Slytherin, and our actions could go either way. Ravenclaw for how we were searching for answers, there for information, chasing curiosity. Slytherin for how we put on false personalities to get along with him better, which was cunning. Going to the trouble was ambitious, and maybe our convincing ways were clever. She said I had a point, and she agreed. He would flirt with both of us and say things we wanted to hear. She rejected it all because she was repulsed by him, but she couldn't say that, so she claimed she ""wasn't ready"". I rejected him because he had a Wife and kids. I didn't care about the whole polygamy thing, because I was convinced that whether she told anyone or not, Lainey was hurt and jealous when other women flirted with him or anything else. One day, he said something bizarre and I got embarrassed and laughed. He wanted to pretend fight with me, and he accidentally hurt my right arm and my back, and I laughed not out of fear, but because I thought it was funny. I wasn't upset or bothered. He apologized anyway. I didn't know it was truly accidental, or on purpose because he was sadistic. The other woman and I went into another room, and a screen on the wall informed us that Asian women were ugly and more likely to be Masculine, and Transgender. This annoyed me. It was rude, racist, not true, and it made no sense. To me, Asians were always overall the best looking. They were often shorter than other races and had higher voices, which were Feminine things. I voiced my opinions out loud, even though I knew he'd know. I almost felt he had superpowers and just knew things, like he could have eyes in the sky always seeing everything. It freaked me out. The woman said she was going to use everything that had gone on in a video on her anti Onision channel. He walked in and told her to leave. I went outside with her, apologized, she was rightfully angry and walked away. I went back in and he stood on the third step down of about fourteen, and said that he was an honest person who wanted to keep everything honest. He said he wanted to know if I had ever thought or said anything bad about him. My heart was racing, and I was sure I would vomit. I worried that he could read my mind and that he knew I was technically a ""hater"" because I was aware of his behaviors. I told the truth, and I turned my face to the left. I expected to be screamed at, insulted, maybe even grabbed by the arm and dragged outside, but none of those happened. Instead, he calmly said ""It's time for you to go."" I was confused, surprised, and thrown off. I said okay, got my things, and left. In the front yard, I found a little white rabbit standing on two feet, wearing a green vest with round framed glasses. I picked it up, put it in my coat pocket, and walked home.

The room I slept in didn’t have a door, and the opening into the attic was in the ceiling of the hall outside of my room. This was an open hole which I would stare into when I went to sleep, since I had no door and the attic was just a black “hole” at night. I slept in this room from my birth until we moved when I was about 11/12. 


Every night when I went to sleep I would see things in the attic when it was very dark and late. I think this was due to the fact that I am quite a creative person with a big imagination. And when you are tired your mind starts to see things that aren’t there.


I used to have frequent dreams about me drifting out of my bed into the attic, and going to bed in the attic. ( there was nothing there, just boxes and cobweb. ) to this day I still remember these dreams very vividly, like they were real memories. 


After a while these dreams started to get weirder and more uncomfortable, for example I would dream about me walking into the hall and hearing someone calling from downstairs. We had a very high and steep staircase at the end of the hall that lead to the kitchen downstairs. 


After a while these dreams starting happening more and more, It would start of with me waking up in the attic “ floating “ down into my bed and walking to the end of the hall looking down at the staircase, I still remember exactly how it looked in my dreams. ( mind you I was about 8 at the time that these dreams used to frequently occur )  I would look down into steep the staircase but in my dreams it was about 10 times steeper and very dark at the bottom. I would see a silhouette of a person with their arms wide open standing at the bottom and calling my name. At the end of the dream I would jump down, everything went very slow and I would wake up, never finding out who or what was calling me at the bottom of the stairs. 


These dreams happened multiple times a week, until they suddenly just stopped forever. To this day I still think about this from time to time, and I wonder if there is a way for me to go back to that dream so to speak. To find out what it was all about.

The dream was pretty mellow at first, I took perspective from someone I’ve never met (this happens a lot). The family consisted of me (a young boy), the young sister, a mother and a stepfather (I don’t remember why I knew this). I remember the father being attentive to every single thing I did, he kept his yes on me no matter what I did, but we stayed in a family room the entire beginning of the dream (a home I’ve never been in). A lot of what happened after that became foggy when I woke up but it lead to the parents going out and leaving me and this sister alone. We spend a portion of the time playing in the kitchen until from one of the windows just through the curtain I saw a car, the car circled the house around me slowly. It kicked in that I was not in a good position being I was standing in front of a window that was slightly open. I remember telling the sister to go to the room and hide while I was closing the windows, and locking the doors, and I know I closed them because I remember the sound of the locks and the cold feeling still lingers on my hands. When I looked out my window I saw that the yard was forming into chucks of familiar yards (ones of old homes I lived in). I even looked around the home it realized everything was a mixture of old homes I lived in. So suddenly I knew the whole format of the house and new a place I could hide. I remember running into a dark room with a abnormally huge window with a closed curtain and heard the cars tires as they slowly drove in the dirt by the window. I remember sitting in silence and then after a while telling the sister we were going to go to another room that had a lock. The room was weird, it was all white but still dark, but I could make out everything in the room. When I got up there I looked out another window and realized it was dark out and only the light of a lamppost next to some random lake was lit. Then from the corner of my view I saw a person emerge from around the house and then look straight up. I backed away and ran into the closet with the sister. We were hiding and I could hear the sound of my heart beating so fast and the sound of our breaths in the silent darkness, I remember vividly trying to restrain my breathing when I began hearing bangs on the front door. I remember trying to call the police but they said they could reach me or something and then hung up. Then the door opened and someone came to the door of them room and knocked. It was silent for a few moments after and when I opened the closet door we were in a whole new room and the door opened and the man walked in. But when he walked in, the room got distorted and it sank in where he stepped, like if he were stepping on some sort of water ballon. As if the walls were fake! The little sister disappeared and it was just me and the man. When he got close to me I think he killed me but I don’t remember, but after that I was shot back to the kitchen and it happened two more times but played out in different rooms again.

0.0,aqc772,23.0,39.0,"This is a kind of update to my post the other day about my girlfriends creepy sleep walking. There isn’t really a solution to anything tho

So there’s been some interesting occurrences since that post pertaining to her sleep walking. First of all, she refuses to see a doctor and insists that she’s ok so idk what to do about that. 

Second, I found out it only occurs at a particular time. I’ve witnessed it twice so far and her episodes occur around 3am each time, regardless of when she falls asleep. Last night we were able to avoid an episode by having her stay up past 3am. She eventually fell asleep around 4:30. She said whenever it happened before it also happened at 3am.

Third, the second time this occurred was really bad. For one, she almost hurt herself really bad. I was pretending to sleep when I saw her at the glass door that leads to a back porch. She unlocked it and started walking outside. I quickly jumped out of bed to get her. When I was leading her back inside, she kept saying “she has to go”. 

Other than trying to walk into the snow, she almost cut herself. She got up out of bed to go to the washroom, but before leaving my room, she grabbed a knife from my desk and placed it on the bedside table. While she was in the washroom I hid the knife. When she got back, she kept repeating “Where did you put it, we need it for the ritual.” I just kept comforting her and hugging her to make sure she stays in bed. Multiple times she also tried to grab a box cutter until I took it away and hid it as well. 

She also did stuff that her fully awake self doesn’t know about. She said she wanted to watch videos so she went on YouTube on her phone and started playing a really creepy Alice in Wonderland Remix (Link: https://youtu.be/tnVij0qC6No). While it was playing, she asked why I was crying (I wasn’t) and wiped my ‘black tears’ away. When I showed her in the morning she said that she’s never heard that song before. The weird part is that she searched specifically for that video. There is also a rosary hanging on my wall, but it’s hidden behind a tapestry thing. She lifted the tapestry and said to take it down because ‘it’ doesn’t like it. She then told me in the morning that she didn’t even know it was there.

After a while, it appeared as if she was fully awake finally. We were talking about regular stuff, she was watching videos on her phone, eating a snack, etc. If it weren’t for these other occurrences, I wouldn’t have been able to tell if she was conscious or not, which scares the fuck out of me. However, every few minutes or so she would stare at me super creepily with her eyes wide open. She would also stare at the glass where ‘it’ is supposedly located and talk to it, usually telling it to stop or something. If she ever fell asleep again, she would revert back to her obvious dream like state. Once she said she heard three chimes, that it was her time to go, and that they were getting impatient. When I asked her in the morning, she said that ‘they’ wanted her blood for a ritual. 

In the morning, she told me that there were these words that she isn’t supposed to say or something. She doesn’t know what they mean or what would happen, but two of the words were Bolotov and Salazar. 

I know this sounds like a fake creepy pasta or something but honest to God it’s not. I don’t know how to help her. I can’t force her to see a doctor.

This was one of the rare nights that my dad slept at home at the same time as us. He works the night shift, so usually he isn’t home at night and if he is home he staying up all night so he could sleep during the day. 

In their dreams the basic story was my mom got cancer and was going to died so my dad tried to trade his life for hers. That was the “storyline” I guess.

My mom dreamt about being diagnosed with cancer and the hospital and dealing with that, and my dad dreamt about trying to make a deal with a demon to bring my mom back and take him instead. 

So they both had separate dreams but they followed the exact same storyline. Then they both woke up at about the same time, crying.

I have lots of vivid dreams pretty frequently, which means I'm fairly confident that if I did dream about a smart phone or using one, I would remember it, at least a little bit. Technology in general tends to rarely feature in my dreams, with the most frequent being electrical towers, pylons and whatnot, or just a TV going in the background. Essentially they serve as environment props in my dreams more than something with actual moving parts. What's also interesting is that most technology is dated, not just phones. Any computer is the big old boxy ones, TVs are fat and have antennas. The last aspect that I find makes all of this noteworthy as well is that I'm 20 years old, which means that while I was alive and conscious of my surroundings and have clear memories of a world without smart phones, for all of my young adult and adult life, it's only ever been smart technology. I would have an easier time believing that someone a good 5-10+ years older than me experiencing this same dream phenomenon, since they had more time to function independently with the technology of the time.
My dreams are probably the very last place that smart phones have left untouched in my life, which is why I find this realization so incredibly interesting and honestly a little reassuring.

I lived on an island in the middle of a lake. At least I thought it was an island; all I could remember was the beach, surrounded by a forest. I drank from the water, so it had to be a lake of some sort. All I knew was that I couldn't see where it ended and where the sky began. The forest was lush with greenery, thick with pines, redwoods and shrubs. I didn't have a house. Or maybe I did, but I don't remember where I lived. I had a fishing pole, so I knew how to fish.

I hunted too. I remember that. I remember looking down at my hands and seeing blood. On the ground was the body of a furry animal. A rabbit maybe? It was.. fuzzy, like how things in the background get hazy when you focus on something closer to your face. It was gray and it had fur. Must have been a rabbit.

It was always warm on the island. When I'm not hunting or fishing, I would sit on a large rock and dangle my feet in the water. Across the lake was an outcropping of land. I don't really understand exactly how far it was, I just knew it was too far to swim out to. I could see the outline of trees and rolling hills. Maybe there were mountains. On the top of the tallest hill sat a large building - no, it was a house. Even though it was miles away, I could make out the windows. At night I would watch it. Seeing the windows lit up made me feel less alone.

I had no sense of time. Sometimes it was noon, then midnight, then morning. Everything occurred in quick lapses; little vignettes of moments. For some reason I did not question it. One moment, I'm fishing in the lake. The next, I am somewhere in the trees. I remember looking up at the light dancing through the leaves and listening to the wind. I could feel it brushing against my skin and fluttering through my hair.

Then I had a radio - a walkie-talkie in my hand. It was just there. I think it was always there. All the dials but one was static. That was when I met her.

I didn't know her name. I don't think she knew mine either. I wasn't sure how I knew it was a girl, I just knew she was. We were friends. I think we had always been friends. She told me she lived in the house on the hill from the other island. She said she could see me sometimes when I sit on the rocks with a pair of binoculars. We would talk about our days. Mine was always the same.

She told me about her family. Mother, father, and an older brother. Her brother didn't live there anymore. I didn't ever get an answer as to why. She never asked me why I lived alone on the island. I never asked either. Once she asked me about my family, but I couldn't remember them. She said it must be nice.

I don't know why she said that.

One night there were pieces of broken bottles on the beach. It was the first time I saw glass up close. I don't know how I knew they were from bottles. I didn't have any bottles on my island. I cut my finger on a particularly sharp piece, and she called me as I was sucking on the wound.

*""Are you okay?""*

*""Yes, just a small cut.""*

*""I saw you on the beach picking up the glass.""*

*""I figured.""*

I looked up to the house and waved.

Suddenly time shifted and it was night. Instantaneous. My finger was still bleeding, and I was mid wave. I saw one tiny flicker of light from the top right corner of the house.

*""Did you see?""* She asked, breathless.

*""Yes! Do it again!""*

The light flickered again. I laughed for the first time. It sounded strange. Muted. Like when you have water in your ear. I don't think I laughed before.

It became our tradition. Whenever the light faded and night fell, she would blink her light and I would wave at her.

*""Do you ever want to see me?""* She asked one day. *""I can see you, but you don't know what I look like.""*

*""Of course I do, but I can't.""*

*""You could build a boat and cross the lake.""*

There, I guess I confirmed it was a lake.

*""I don't know how.""* I responded, looking around at my island. There were no tools.

*""I'll help you.""*

It was like a montage from a movie, only without music. I remember trying different ways of tying together different branches only to have them fall apart a few feet into the lake. I tried a dozen times. I even tied some together with some clothes - oh, I guess I had other clothes; but it broke anyway and I had to dry the clothes on the sand.

*""I don't think I can come over.""* I whispered into the radio.

*""That's okay. I'll just keep talking to you anyway.""*

*""Do you.. want to come to me?""*

*""My mom wouldn't let me.""*

*""Why?""*

*""She doesn't think you're real.""*

*""I can talk to her. Or you can lend her your binoculars.""*

*""That's true.""*

We never talked about it again.

I think it might have been months. Or years. Or decades. I don't know. I just remember one night seeing the moon brighter and fuller than I had ever seen it before. The water of the lake receded from my shores almost there was a large drain somewhere in the distance, sucking all the water away. I followed the receding water for a long time until finally I realized it wasn't going to stop and I turned around to look at my island. I realized then I had walked about halfway in between my island and her's.

I didn't hesitate. I kept following the receding water. It felt like weeks but the moon never wavered, and the water didn't stop.

Finally, I arrived at her shores. Suddenly it was day time and the sun was bright overhead. The water lapped hungrily at the shores as if it hadn't just been miles away. It was always there I think. I was there though. I was here.

I looked into the thick forest and saw the tips of the mountains in the distance. I considered resting, but I wasn't even tired. I looked back at my island again and saw it across the lake, the trees gently swaying in the breeze.

Days passed before I got through the forest and reached the base of the mountain where her house stood. Weeks, before I climbed to the top of the first plateau. I didn't call her on my way. I think I wanted to surprise her. I don't think I had my radio.

No, I definitely didn't have my radio.

Eventually the path I was on crested to a large plain and stretched into a driveway of a large mansion. The walls were painted white - or it was once, but now it looked yellowed by the elements. Paint was peeling off many places and I could see them in small piles around the property. It was 3 stories tall. I recognized her window on the top right. I didn't know she had curtains. They were blue. It had cross-hatched trellises below each window and the window shutters on the bottom floor were painted a light blue. Paint was coming off of them too.

I approached the front door and pressed on the bell, but no sound came out. The only sound was the wind and some seagulls squawking overhead. I knocked. On the third knock, the door creaked open. I slowly pushed the door open to a dusty foyer, furniture covered in white sheets and cobwebs. I recognized the shapes somehow, even though I don't remember having furniture at my island. There was a coffee table, uncovered, with a tea set as if it was just waiting for a guest.

I pressed further into the house, my bare feet leaving behind damp prints on the dusty floor. The foyer led to a wide ballroom, the walls adorned with faded photographs in golden frames with filigree. There was a dusty red carpet that led to the kitchen. A cabinet stood below a large ornate mirror on the right hand wall. From where I stood, I counted 3 doors on the bottom level and traced a spiral staircase up the second and third floor. I tried the doors but they were locked. I ran my fingers on the cabinet and perused the little ornaments that decorated them. I saw small ceramic figurines of different animals and some picture frames. I studied the photo as best as I could but I couldn't make any details out. It was like the fade of time focused specifically on their faces. I could make out that there were four people in it. Two adults and two children, one on each side. The mom, or the taller woman in the picture had long wavy light hair. The girl child had straight dark hair. The two men both had darker hair, cropped short.

Sighing, I put the frame down where I had found it and made my way into the kitchen.

""Hello?"" I called. I cocked my head and tried again. I couldn't hear my voice. I could feel the sound escape my throat, but again, all I could hear was the wind.

The kitchen was beautiful with white cupboards decorated with painted flowers, an island in the middle that held the range, and large glass doors that led out to a wooden deck overlooking the sprawling landscape of the mountains. I could see for miles. I stood there for a moment, my hand pressed against the glass door, watching the scenery. When I left, my hand print remained, fogging up the glass.

The cupboards were bare, except for the occasional spider. The refrigerator held a solitary glass of orange juice. I sniffed it and took a sip. It was still fresh. I studied the kitchen, marveling at the handiwork of some hand carved tiles on the counter. There was a small dining table tucked in the corner, four chairs, and a bench, all covered with sheets. I finished the juice and placed the glass in the sink.

Coming back into the ballroom, I started ascending the stairs, each step echoing in the silent house. The second floor had four doors, two on each side of the room, with the banister outlining the open space in the center. I knocked softly on the first three doors and tried the handles but they were stuck fast. On the fourth door, the knob gave way entirely, falling loudly on the wooden floor. The door creaked open as I stepped inside.

It was a bedroom with a massive four post bed, which was still made with red sheets, and a reading nook looking out to the water. I raised the curtain and in the distance I was able to make out my island. I couldn't see where it ended, just the waterline and beach where I would spend my days.

I rifled through some drawers but they were all empty. I sat on the bed and marveled at the softness of the pillows. I didn't have any pillows. I wonder if she would mind if I brought some home.

What even was home?

I poked around the room some more but couldn't find anything. Where was her family? Is it strange that this was the first time I had asked that question?

I made my way to the third floor and was greeted by a hallway leading to a solitary door. This must have been her room.

""Hey, are you in there?"" I tried to speak, but it was the same result as in the kitchen. Maybe I got something stuck in my ears. I tried the handle and it allowed me in; the hinges surprisingly quiet.

Her room was simple. A small bed in one corner with blue sheets that matched her curtains. A white dresser and a nightstand stood next to her bed. By the windowsill was a small chair and as the curtains gently flapped in the wind, I saw the binoculars and her radio sitting on the sill. I checked her drawers and found them empty, as with the rest of the house. Sighing again, I sat in the chair and raised the binoculars to my face. Suddenly, the radio hissed with static, the sound shattering the silence and startling me. I almost dropped the binoculars out the window.

*""Hello?""* Her voice rang through the speaker. *""Hey, are you in there?""*

*""Yes, where are you?""*

My voice was working again.

*""I'm here. Look through!""*

I peered through the binoculars and saw a tiny figure on my island waving at me.

*""Why are you there?""* I asked.

*""The water ran away so I thought I should visit you.""*

*""We had the same idea.""*

She laughed. It sounded like my laugh.

*""What do we do?""* I muttered into the mouth piece. The figure stood on top of the rocks where I would normally go.

*""I don't know,""* She sighed.

*""Where's your family?""*

*""They aren't there.""*

*""I noticed.""*

The figure jumped back onto the sand and started picking up something that sparkled in the sunlight. I saw her snap her hand back as if something had hurt her.

*""Are you okay?""*

*""Yes, just a small cut.""*

*""I saw you on the beach picking up the glass.""*

*""I figured.""*

Night blinked in and I could hardly see her figure anymore. Curious, I tested the light switch in her room. The light flooded the small room and shined through the window. I picked up the radio.

*""Did you see?""* I asked, breathless.

*""Yes! Do it again!""*

I flicked the light switch off, and back on again in quick succession.

On the fifth 'on' flick, I opened my eyes, dazed. I was laying in my bed, confused and wary. I couldn't place where I was for a moment until I realized that it was still night. Looking at the clock, I saw it was still around 2 AM. I turned to my side, remnants of the dream still incredibly vivid.

So a few years ago I had a boyfriend who I dated on and off a few times. We ended things on good terms but ever since we broke up we haven't spoken much. I never used to have dreams about him, not even while we were dating, until this one dream two years ago.

The dream was very vivid and I remember every detail. I was walking down an extremely crowded street (the street itself looked really old) and all the people who were walking down the street were walking in the opposite direction, so I was basically pushing through the crowd. In one moment, I realised another person was walking in front of me (so we were the only two walking forward). I didn't know it was my ex until he turned his head and looked at me. At that moment, he turned right into another street and that's when I woke up.

So when I woke up, first thing I did was grab my phone (per usual). I got a text from a friend who went to highschool with him saying that he commited suicide that night. I still think of the dream as a sort of ""last goodbye"".

I dreamed I was in this void, like a pocket dimension. It wasn't really anything physically describable, just something I could feel and be cognitive that I was in if you know what I mean. This void presented me two possibilities to return to the waking world; my true reality, which in the dream presented itself as a horrible eternal loop of me being in the same situation I'm in in real life right now, and two, my mother's voice calling to me from...somewhere, telling me to come home, to a better place than I know.

The thing was, it wasn't my mother's voice. It was...something else, pretending to be her. I could sense the evil in its voice, that it was an imitation of my mother that was convincing but just *off* enough for me to notice. I began to grow scared and attempted to resist the siren's song, for lack of a better term. Both the scenarios I was presented with were horrible and just felt...evil. 

It happened over and over again. And I do mean OVER and OVER. The same situation, the same voice, the same scenarios and the same words being spoken. It was soon that I began to realize that I was stuck and began to feel physical, horrible panic in the dream even though I had no form. This panic presented itself to me in the form of the blankets above my head; I clawed at them, desperate to get out and back into the real world, but each time I did, I was only met with more fabric. 

This continued over and over. I cannot describe the crushing feelings that had sunken in by this point. It was time dilation to the extreme extent you can feel in a dream. It felt...eternal. I had always been in this situation, always would, and this was my reality now. The immense feeling of loneliness and emptiness was simply...unparalleled. And all of this probably took place in about a minute or two of real time.

It felt like what actual hell would be like if it existed. Not fire and brimstone and gnashing of teeth, but sheer loneliness, the indescribable feeling of being conscious of eternity and the crushing weight of existing in a form of existence beyond human comprehension, without our consciousness expanding to comprehend it and staying within the bounds of what we can experience as living humans.

Thankfully I awoke and I'm okay now, obviously. But that is not a dream I'm ever going to soon forget. I wonder if anyone else has had an experience of time dilation/loops in a dream this bad?

0.0,aq7o7b,0.0,1.0,"I don't remember too much but I remember as much as enough to say I had 3 dreams, and they each had quite some substance.

First, the pot brownie dream. I'm in my homeroom classroom from Junior year of high school, I'm sitting up front as the teacher talks about some shit. Behind me is my buddy (who I dreamt of before) who has a big Ziploc bag of brownies, he says to the teacher, ""You want some pot brownie??"" the teacher is like ""I'll pass"" but I say, despite my horrible experience with pot brownies, ""Hey I'll have one."" I get up and walk over to him, he breaks it in half and gives me the bigger piece, how generous...

This is where things transition, I don't even know if I ate it or not, but I did not feel high in the dream so I'm sure this short sequence ended abruptly.

Now, for the other short dream sequence, I'm in a car, in the backseat, and my mom and dad up front, dad's driving, mom's in the passenger seat. It's quite dark as we're driving on the highway, my mom is eating some candy from a silver bag, she's quite ecstatic and they're chatting and suddenly, she takes a handful and starts throwing the orange candy out the window (they were like orange balls.) She's laughing and happy, which is good. Suddenly, an 18 wheeler overtakes us and crosses back into our lane; it's tires are completely coated orange, we're all laughing our asses off, I'm especially laughing really hard, I look behind and there's another truck behind us and it's entire front grill plus the tires are all coated orange.

Another transition, this last dream sequence is quite odd and a bit disturbing, but there's some interesting guest stars, it's been a while since I've had some characters from film and TV in my dream.

This dream starts out with me looking over a huge valley from the top of a hill, it's absolutely beautiful and the enormity of the rolling hills leaves me in awe as I remember seeing it. There are houses and huts scattered throughout, not many roads (they were dirt roads, not paved.) some stone wall structures too, looked almost like some place in China. I turn and there's this big building, people standing around and sort of hanging out or something like that. Immediately I recognize my best friend (not the same friend from earlier; but another individual I've dreamt about) and he says, ""We got a situation dude."" We walk over to this little kid bullying this fat kid, the little kid is saying extremely rude things and before I could attempt to interject, the fat kid picks up the little kid and gives him the dirtiest suplex I've ever seen. It was brutal, everyone was shocked, Adults, teenagers, and kids. These two women console the fat kid since he's crying and upset, I walk up and tell the kid, ""Hey it's okay, you did good. Go home and rest little buddy."" I assume the two women were his parents; two mom's. They leave, other people around leave too. 

So now it's me and my best bud, standing in front of this little kid who's unconscious on the ground. He says ,""Is he dead?"" I say, ""He'll be ok, I think."" We go inside the building, and we realize it's a Chinese restaurant, and I make the assumption at this current moment, typing this all out, that this was OUR restaurant, since no one was inside, no cooks or chefs, just tables, a counter top, and lots of food all ready to be eaten. I'm not really too sure why were inside doing, but what I remember is we went to this back part, and went into a walk in freezer, I stood outside it to hold the door open, all of a sudden, Bender Bending Rodriguez shows up, I ask him, ""What are you doing here Bender?"" (remember, I'm not lucid, but even my dream self was totally befuddled by the fact a cartoon character shown up in my dream. It's happened before tho, in my early childhood mostly) He didn't say anything to me, he just walked into the kitchen, and grabbed this enormous platter of fried rice, and was about to walk out, me and my bud ran to him and were trying to get him to help us out. After some time trying to convince him to help us, he puts the platter down on an empty table and says, ""I have a plan!"" we go to the walk in freezer, he grabs all these colored strings, and we follow him as he exits the building, along with him holding the platter of fried rice. He puts it down on the ground, and rigs the strings to the inside doorknob, and has it tied to the outside screen door, I ask him, ""What the hell is this for?"" He says, ""So you can get in if you need to."" We all then look down at the kid, he's still unconscious, Bender asks us, ""Why do you have a dead kid?"" my bud exclaims, ""He's dead!?"" (The kid is lying on his back, but his elbows are stiff, his neck is stretched, it's like he's perpetually stiffened) Bender leaves with his friend rice, and we walk over to the edge of the hill and we look down at this weird hut, with stone slabs placed in weird patterns, kinda like a traditional farmland, I don't really know how to describe it other than it looks kinda like some place in South-East Asia or China or something like that. As we're looking down at this place, these people in white jump suits (not KKK clothes! more like the white outfits guards in mental asylum's wear.) and they're beating the shit out of the women from earlier, I see one kick the woman out from the hut, the other is having her head slammed into the stone wall, it's absolutely terrible. I tell my bud, ""We gotta help them!"" he responds with, ""We gotta watch the restaurant."" I look back down... and that's as much as I can remember about this.

The last thing I remember from this dream is seeing something happen to the restaurant, a flow of toxic sludge floods the interior, but that's pretty much it for last night's dreams. I'm not entirely sure how or what can be interpreted from this, hope it's entertaining at least.

I bought tickets for the star wars remake interactive experience. The whole thing was set up in a football sized theater with a large screen bifurcating the large rectangular space space. Everyone was harnessed to a rope and bungee system.  The active seats would get pulled and flung all around the play area during action scenes. The inactive seats were regular theater seats. The screen in the middle would turn towards the audience during inactive scenes. [Here is a drawing of it.](https://imgur.com/UoNzvkQ) 



The movie started with the classic tatooine bar scene, skipping past luke on the farm. Han and chewie are there, but the scenes are strange patch jobs of harrison ford’s old performance, harrison ford cutscenes and the new actor from the solo movie. The lines were quite obviously spliced together making the performance strange, and inconsistent. . Notably, chewie spoke in regular language instead of his usual grunts and growls. His voice was nasally, but strong. Kind of like Abraham lincoln from the movie Lincoln, but without the kentucky accent. The scene was luke and obi wan negotiating with han and chewie to get off of tatooine. As the negotiations were happening, a single stormtrooper walks in and starts making trouble, trying to round up criminals. The entire canteen doesn’t take kindly to it, someone shoots him, then a wild bar fight breaks out as luke, obiwan, han and chewie slip out the back to the falcon. 

This is the beginning of the first action scene. The active seats are picked up by the rope system. And pulled all around the play area. Sometimes you are lowered enough to run across the ground but not very often. When you DO touch the ground, you have control over where you go but often those parts don’t last very long and only one seat is on the ground on each side at a time. The main way of interacting with things is with a gun that is attached to the seat. You point it towards the ground and the screen shooting yellow panels that remove physical barriers or blue panels that activate other things on the ground. Yellow panels are often placed in a grid of nine, but there are a few 1 panel spots on the ground. They usually hide blue panels but sometimes have other goodies inside of them too. 

The first action scene is a space escape with a star destroyer pursuing us. At first, the play area is just space, with tie fighters flying all around, while the screen has the star destroyer that floats menacingly. At first we just circle the outside of the play area blasting tie fighters until the star destroyer gets close enough. The play area the becomes the surface of the star destroyer and audience members start getting to touch down the surface of the play area. The first time I do it, several yellow panels have already been shot, revealing blue panels underneath. But, I discover that if I approach the yellow paneled areas from the side, I can attack the blue spots underneath because the yellow shields are in a 3d space, and only protect them from above. 

I think we don’t do enough damage to the star destroyer and tatooine in the background gets destroyed as the falcon flies away. The next scene is in some kind of urban metropolis. It looks similar to naboo, however the whole place is run down, and shoddy. Aliens of all kind are in booths selling food, and wares, bartering, repairing ships, and any other number of activities. I wish I could remember how these aliens looked specifically because I remember there was an interesting mix. Unfortunately this is where the dream ends.

I got up at 5:30, as I wanted to, but I was too tired to get up so I decided to take a two hour sleep. And so the nightmare begins.

I'm laying in a baby cradle in an empty, dark room. Right in front of me, there's a boy playing on a music box. He leaned his music box on the front side of my bed, so I could clearly see his face. I don't remember it now, but then it reminded me about this boy from Polar Express movie. The melody was annoying, but I memorized it fast. 

Boom. My alarm for 7:30 goes off. I surely had a lack of sleep, so I turned off the alarm clock and fell asleep.

In the second half of the dream, I was sitting at my desk. Somebody was trying to call me via Skype on my tablet. I answer. Video quality was low, but I could recognize a chubby boy. He was saying something like that:

- Do you appreciate our friend William for composing such a melody?

And again, this part ends unexpectedly.

Then, I somehow get to my chair. Looking in a tablet gallery, I discover hundreds of photos of the fat boy. Well, not the photos exactly, more like screenshots of the video call I answered.

I also knew this was going to happen and have a set app that helps me regulate breathing so when I went from 3 beats per sec back to normal breathing the app congratulates me in success and I am happy now that I can just walk home and don’t have to bus. 

When I’m home I’m pretty tired and realize it’s been a long day so I want to turn on the light, the switch is broken or the light is ? I’ve had this problem before I know what to do I’ll let the light from the hallway come In so I can see and fix it when I face the door the door behind it is open and a person s outline is there standing and asks me “cant sleep?” I tell them the light is broken maybe it’s the electricity in the house and then he shuffle walks from side to side  to me in a happy manner and is dancing in front of me touching my front chest (trying to absorb me) and this is when I realize that I’m dreaming I cant even see his face it’s all a dark figure still.

I was so excited to write this dream down because for the first time ever, its a dream that kinda has a plot to it. It has a rise and fall. And also its just so detailed. I just thought I'd share it here.


The dream was set in wartime. It starts in a small abandoned supermarket on some quiet highway in what seems to be rural area. Two American soldiers are raiding the supermarket for supplies, but arranging the stuff back on the shelves as if no-one has been there. This is because apparently for some reason, two German soldiers are after the two Americans and are just hours behind them on the highway. 

The Americans load up and get on their jeep and start driving. A few days later they arrive at a post-apocalyptic-looking city with tall buildings that are densely situated together. They decide to drive in a big trench-like passage that flows underground and below bridges, just for extra cover in case the two Germans are nearby. They take this passage into the heart of the city. The two Germans also arrive in the town at about the same time. Their jeep zooms on an elevated road, and below their road there's a tunnel opening that is perpendicular to the road. The two Americans emerge from that opening just moments after the Germans have passed. Both parties in their jeeps. Both unaware of the other's presence.

There are then bridge-like platforms in the city, not connecting two lands between rivers, but connecting two buildings to each other, 5 stories up in the air. These bridges are short, maybe around 5 metres long, but were used to carry vehicles. There were two of these situated parallel and near to each other. Both the American jeep and the German jeep were about to take these bridges at the same time, in the same direction. They would be exposed to each other immediately. Just as the two were about to make the cross, oblivious to the other, an air bombing occurred in the distance, with airplane and bomb sounds loud enough to cancel out the noise of the jeeps. Both jeeps were on their respective platforms. The Germans look toward the right, the direction of the air raid, unaware of the Americans to their left. The Americans do the same, and they see the German jeep. Oh crap. They try to move across the platform before the Germans could see them, but not so fast as to make their engine roar. Just as they were about to make it across and into cover, one German turns his head, and spots the tail end of the jeep entering behind the building. They scramble. The chase is on. 

They make it back down to road level, and try to find a way out of the city, but because of how dense it is, it was like a maze of buildings. The driver of the American jeep was panicking as he swerved junction after junction. The other American then spots a ramp-like structure that shoots up into an elevated road that leads out of the city. The driver says 'we're never gonna make it' but the other American insists. They scream at each other as the jeep is on the other end of the road leading up to the ramp. In what seems like a classic this-is-it escape scene, the German jeep then appears behind them on the same road, at a distance behind. The Germans are charging at full speed toward the Americans. The American driver finally steps on the accelerator and zooms past the empty buildings. The jeep goes up the ramp and just makes it on the elevated road. The Americans are celebrate with relief as they continue to drive. 

The scene then cuts to the jeep being on the major highway again, my point of view pans out of the jeep and above the road, revealing dozens of other military vehicles travelling. 

They made it. They're back with their company.

My girlfriend was also at the grocery store using her laptop for some reason. Irl I have class and I have to wake up for it so I looked at the time on the laptop and it was right around when I had to wake up.

After finally realizing that I’m dreaming again I start freaking out because I really can’t get out and this is where things get crazy. I notice something I didn’t see before. Engraved into the floor of the grocery store is a symbol in the shape of a circle that reminded me of a button, text that I can’t read, and a business logo. Out of desperation I start slapping the circle because something is telling me that it is gonna help me wake up but at a price. I didn’t care about the consequences I just wanted to get out. It is just too random and absurd that it has to be true. I was theory crafting after I woke up but basically I fell asleep around 3 AM and my girlfriend told me that 3 AM is the devils time.

I got up and asked my mom where they went and she said that they just went to lead there grandparents to our house, so I said okay and thought nothing of it.

Something of a virgin. I had an unusual dream last night, it took place in a third-person world where I was more like an invisible observer than a person, as though I was some kind of camera if you will.

Needless to say the dream began in some kind of abstract, deep blue void. A large cylinder that had been tipped over onto its side was approaching me slowly: it had no top or bottom, and I was entering directly inside of it. As the camera came closer inside I realised that the cylinder was made of cubes (think of something you would make out of LEGO or in Minecraft) and that there were hundreds of tiny red imp creatures with bulbous, spherical eyes and long, thin ears lining the inside of the tube.

Upon this, an unseen narrator began speaking in my ears. He had a sort-of witty vibe, like some kind of worldly streetwise person with a sense of humour. I couldn't tell if he was British or American but he was somewhere between those two accents. He reminded me of Rap Rat, if you've ever seen him. He made some witty vocalisations and phrases before (possibly telekinetically) tilting the LEGO tube downwards, which caused the imps inside to screech and cling on violently to their cylindrical abode but ultimately be dropped into the void.

Once the narrator had disposed of them, my vision became more centralised on the square tube's opening. He started giving me a happy-go-lucky monologue about what could have been the futility of sex and love or something to that effect. Something quite morose delivered from a cartoon-like and enthusiastic persona.

The dream became increasingly first-person as peculiar devices began appearing in-front of me and performing actions. Many of the devices were sexual organs and appendages, but they had been transformed into strange hydraulic toys: for instance one of the things he showed me was a phallus consisting of a blue rubber glans where the actual base of the willy was comprised of multiple separate metallic tubes and pistons.

Our unseen narrator showed me a range of tricks, I believe each was meant to undermine the idea of a stable relationship. The only one I distinctly remember was with the aforementioned robot penis, where he told me that ""she'll just get squired inside of by somebody else"" as the pistons in the phallus kept retracting back and forth to spurt out a milk-like fluid (a bit more grey and bold than spunk, I think it was mercury?).

I wouldn't say I felt like the narrator was dismissing my sexual competence or trying to undermine my confidence, he felt more like he was just overprotective or wounded by some past misfortune. I woke up some time during his lecture.

It starts out with me in the forest at night. It's a new moon type of night and extremely dark. I've never liked the dark so I'm freaking out. Through the forest I see a faint light and start running towards it. As I get closer, I can tell it's a campfire. When I finally get there, I see two disemboweled bodies that I can't identify. So now I'm totally freaked out and I freeze. Then I hear a noise that's somewhere between twigs snapping and the sound of joints popping. I look and right beside the fire is a horrible creature hunched all the way down staring at the ground. It has black skin and is extremely emaciated. It's extremities are long and narrow. It has a humanoid head with no hair, no mouth, no nose, no ears, but absolutely huge black eyes. It's fingers are extremely long and come to a sharp point. They're not claws, just sharp fingers. It slowly looks up at me. With each move it makes, I hear the popping sound. It slowly rises to a forward slouching stand. Then it lets out a bloodcurdling scream from a huge mouth that appears out of nowhere and lunges at me. Then I wake up. 

When trying to envision the creature, the best visual representation of it would probably be the rake from the creepypasta story. The first time I saw that I freaked out considering my dreams started way before creepypastas were a thing. Not so much the story behind but just the image.

For some time we have been at each other’s throats... always frustrated at one another and very snappy.

Last night I dreamt of another woman.
Let me preface by letting you know I very rarely remember dreams. They are 99.9% gone within seconds of me waking up. 

Edit: I had listened to Mumford and Sons newest album before going to sleep. It’s kind of moody.

Not sure how dreams actually work but I remember this “segment” vividly. 

I was among 20-30 people on a sunny cliff overlooking a very large body of water (I suspect the ocean) and we are paired off. Half of the people are inside a sort of mechanized cardboard animal, the other half including me are riding on top of their partners animal. (Dreams are fucking weird) We are racing around having an extremely fun time, our animal is a cardboard giraffe. Me and my partner, the dream girl, are IN SYNC... we are working soooo well together and her voice is so soothing. After a fantastic time frolicking with our giraffe we decide to spin our cardboard machine like a top... around and around we go working in perfect harmony to get this thing to spin just so. Our momentum finally stops and the box (now its just a box with her inside) falls flat and still. We chat through the thin walls and I break open the sealed top. She is heavenly, blonde and cute. I notice (dreams are weird) that she has blue, white and black painted symbols on her arms and legs. Turns out she did it herself as a sort of art project, which I reallllllly dig.... being unique and slightly eccentric is my cup of tea. She then notices my tattoos and she’s into them just exploring and learning my body. (My shirt is off apparently) So she makes it to my back, and gets very excited about a tattoo on my right upper back. After a few oohs and ahhs and something something about that’s her favorite, I feel her lips on the back of my neck. Again she presses her lips on me this time lower (between my shoulder blades). What is crazy is I can feel it. I am in complete sensory awareness of this beautiful creature kissing my back. It is warm and a perfect calm and happiness flood over me. It gets warmer the longer she is there blessing me with her touch. The positive emotion that overcame me at this time is tremendous. I have NEVER been as happy in my entire life. The euphoria was real. The warmth and pure joy actually woke me up. I woke up. Confused, yes, but so so so happy. 

I laid there processing what had and was happening. The latter more of a slowly sinking into reality and complete and utter longing to return to the sea side cliff and that woman’s hold on my soul.

I don’t know what to think. I’m right back in reality with y’all. One thing is for sure, tonight I am going to try to return to that time and place.

But through these sections that are missing, I can see through, like how invisibility works, so never mind.

Nothing seems abnormal. My dogs are here. My cat is here. They look normal when I look at them through my camera. My parents are asleep, and it’s quiet like normal. The only strange thing I can think of right now, was that light when I woke up. I don’t have anything in that room that is flashing. Any lights that are on, are solid. And the WiFi lights are blue, the computer light is white, but the light there was before had a hint of red or orange to it. I even thought, maybe it’s a car going past on the road. But I have seen many vehicles with custom modifications, and never have I seen any street legal car with red headlights or headlight tint. That and it’s illegal to have that anyway. Also I never heard an engine noise. I can hear any vehicle that passes by our house, and I can usually tell what it is simply off the engine noise. But unless someone is driving a red lighted Tesla on a dirt road in the middle of nowhere without making a sound, it wasn’t a vehicle.

If anybody can help me figure out why I keep having this dream, or if you have had something similar, please let me know. I am not usually one to make up weird conspiracies, but something about this dream doesn’t feel right to me at all. It feels all too real and vivid.

**January 8th- ""Seagulls and children are dangerous""**

>Some sort of third person story. Little animated shorts one where a dude pretends to match the weight of the other. I am the captain of a ship. Get shot down by a seagull. Lay in the pebbles at the beach. Monologue/brood on death. Berlin wall still existed. Decide to go to the museum of games. Some birthday party is held there. \[garbled mess\] get a cool book. Kid steals it. 

* This one was a cool one. The dude was being all nice matching the weight of his competitor, just to one-up the other in a show of raw strength. The seagull had fantastic aim, and it shot down my ship and the pebbles were comfortable. 

**January 9th-""The beginnings of the casino dreams""**

>\-Queen around the queen of England.   
>  
>\-In Seattle again in a massive casino wandering around. located on the space needle. Need money so play gambling machine. Decide to visit the top of the needle. The elevator takes me to a van. Van is a haunted tour thing drive around seeing sketchy stuff. Order a porn magazine online even though I have a wife. 

* The man who runs the casino appears every so often in my more recent dreams in February. It is interesting to look back at old dreams and see some foreshadowing to future prominent themes. The casino was sleazy as you would expect, but the entire gambling floor rotated slowly along with the needle, which is kind of cool. 

**January 10th-""I push my hair through my eyes""**

>\-A moderate nightmare. Tasked with painting inside of a house. House is haunted with something. Says it knows us and wants to kill us. I am like eh whatever and it gets mad. Uses tentacles to push into eyeballs.  A few people die and we lock all doors. Result if a humanoid figure with eyes. It is really hard to illustrate.   
>  
>\-Another nightmare. Takes place in the country with an old farmer. He is a living genius. Go to his treehouse with friends. Something about his dead wife haunting us. Buy books to begin to repel her. Go to a movie about her. Set all the die on the dark grey side. Movies start and so does the screaming. I clutch bag o coins in my pocket. 

* I was graced by a double whammy. The first set of nightmares which will slowly creep up every now and then.  The humanoid monster was covered in hair and was similar to the SCP no one can talk about. It killed by shoving its tentacles into peoples eyeballs. Rather unpleasant, but effective in practice. The farmer was a nice guy, felt bad for him. At some point in the dream, we were all just bouncing in his trampoline having a great time.

* It's fairly rare to have a slew of dreams like this one. During war dreams similar to this I am known to not be one to wait around. The drum solo was surreal.

Several Italian mafia members tell me that they will kill me. I decide to join them. Must kill a person to prove loyalty. Travel with one member to a new location. Cops show up and I oast the hell out of them. Something about the sop nose. Land in the wrong city with zombies. Dude dies and I travel back in time. Now its a girl instead of a guy. Call 911 say she's taking me across the border. The dream ends with my playing game. 

* The mafia is a huge theme in February dreams. Several long dreams will be posted in a few days about it, but it all started from this dream.

This is a real story. 

Years ago, I dreamed Grandma came to me and said, “Tell your dad. How come I couldn’t find him?”

Grandma had passed away long time ago. When I woke up, I called dad and told him about that. Dad said that he got it.

On the Christmas vacation, when we went back to parents’ home, mum asked me if I really dreamed it. Because the day before I called back, my uncle was almost bankrupted. He almost lost everything. The bank was about to take the house off as the mortgage. Because uncle got serious financial issues. My dad loaned uncle lots of money long long time ago. Uncle never paid back. So dad didn’t want to talk to uncle for a long time.

When my grandma were alive, every time uncle got financial issues, grandma would come to dad and asked dad to help uncle. So when I said I dreamed grandma, my family thought of it. Then gave uncle some money again.

I wondered why didn’t grandma go to dad’s dream. ",new,Grandma came to dad’s dream for helping uncle,1.0

My biggest and most difficult problems to resolve are negative self talk and perfectionism. I think the dream I had last night was a kind of breakthrough. 


It started in this building.  I've definitely been here in dreams before because I recognized it. It looked like a mix between an airport and a large mall. The carpet was a dull red like the kind you would see in a movie theater or in an arcade. I was on my phone and I saw that there was going to be a concert for my favorite band nearby. The only hang up was that it was on an island across a small river, and I didn't have a car to get to the crossing or a boat to even cross the river. I wanted to go anyways, so I started to head out. 


I got outside and it was stormy. Less like a thunderstorm and more of a torrential downpour. The streets were flooded, and within minutes I was soaked. I kept walking, but I started to get super negative with myself. Thinking things like ""why do I always do stupid shit like this,"" all the way to berating myself for not having friends to go with me to this concert. I was sad, and the rain compounded/reflected that. I was cold to the bone and the weight of the rain and my soaked clothes made it feel like I was carrying the whole world on my shoulders.  


An old beige car drove up to me and the driver asked me if I needed a ride. I was debating saying no, but then I looked up and the lead singer of the band I was going to see was driving the car with the drummer/supporting vocalist in the front seat. So I hopped in the back and apologized about getting the seat wet, but they were like don't worry about it and turned up the heat in the car.  I was sitting in the middle seat so I could see where we were going.  I also wasn't wearing a seatbelt, but the car didn't have any so there wasn't anything I could do about that. 


When I was outside, the entire world was gray. Bleak and gray. In the car, it was warmer and lighter, both in colors and how I felt. The two guys were laughing and I found myself laughing too. 


We got to the river crossing and weren't slowing down so I was like ""wait wait wait"" but we kept driving right into the river. The water almost covered the hood of the car, and it seemed rough with waves. I started getting really anxious, thinking that this is how people die and I don't want to drown and I should have done this that and the other thing. But then the two band members started laughing and I had the feeling that everything was going to be alright. 


We made it out of the river and pulled up to this old white farmhouse. There were bushes and trees lining the driveway and on the side of the house, and the house itself looked like it had seen some wear and tear over the past 50 years. We pulled into the garage and got out of the car. The garage was surprisingly neat. I'm still soaked at this point and starting to shiver. The lead singer went somewhere and grabbed me a sweatshirt. I'm 100% positive it was a band sweatshirt that I was going to buy later that night. It was purple and turquoise and gray, and I remember pausing at the choice of colors because it didn't match the album art in any way. It also had lyrics on it but I forget what they were or which song they were from. 


I pulled the sweatshirt over my head and sat down on a bench under one of the garage windows. The sweatshirt was warm and dry and I felt safe wearing it. The second guy had gone inside to get something, but the lead singer sat on the other end of the bench. Then he turned to face me and said ""why are you always so hard on yourself?"" I didn't have an answer, but I felt relieved in that moment. I woke up after that. 


Most of the time, my dreams are a reflection of the stress I feel during the day. This is the first time that they felt like a refuge from that stress. Also, what the lead singer said is what my therapist and my family have been saying to me for years. I think it finally stuck somewhere in my subconscious. I feel like I have permission to give myself a break now. Acknowledging that I am hard on myself and that my negative self talk isn't normal is probably the nicest thing I've said to myself in a long time.

The beginning of the dream is a bit of a blur. Memory of the dream begins as I wander a grayed out wasteland with an ambiguous partner. In this place there are many nightmarish ghost like creatures, that just want some attention, though my partner warns that if I give in to helping them I will turn into one. We enter a warehouse of sorts and there's a grayed out girl playing, and now she morphs into a dingy yellow PacMan looking form, this seems to alarm my partner and he/she reaches for some sesame seeds on a nearby shelf right as the pacman turns into a lemon with a wedge cut out of it. It lets out an awful sound- a mixture of the PacMan 'Whomp' with a painful scream- as the seeds make contact and yet again the shape morphs, this time into an odd bright yellow girl, which I know in my head is still PacMan. At this point she begs me to help her and ignoring my friends pleas I do. She quickly embraces me and before I know it, we're undressed and I'm turning yellow as we start getting freaky. It actually wasn't bad. It was at this point my brain had a moment of lucidity and said ""Wait, what is going on"" and I woke myself up before Pacman could successfully do as the Cards Against Humanity card says.

0.0,apzu0u,1.0,1.0,"I had a dream that literally didn’t wake me up. I was a baby, laid on a huge nest made out of black velvet/silk, with a flat, shiny ground made of obsidian stretching out as far as the eye could see (which certainly wasn’t far, considering that there was no sun, or other source of natural light). I caught a glimpse of a massive black serpents tail circling the nest out of the corner of my eye, and I could hear something hissing. Since I was extremely young in the dream, I didn’t have the neck muscles needed to turn and face whatever that thing was that was circling me. I was helpless, and yet, I was completely aware that I was dreaming. 

Now, usually I can easily force myself awake when I dream, in fact, it happens quite frequently when I’m subconsciously aware that I’m late for something, or have something to do. But this time, was different. I was gripped with a cold, heavy fear, and I was desperately trying to wake up before that thing I saw out of the corner of my eye managed to make its way back around. I cried, I begged, I pleaded to wake up. I remember, through cold, fear filled tears crying “please, I want to wake up”, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t. The thing eventually made its way back around, and I saw a vast, ferocious black panthers face glaring back at me like I was a meal to be played with. 

Then came the most chilling part. In a voice so clear that I’m convinced it came from the waking world, and not that of dreams, it said to me “I won’t let you wake up”.  I continued to struggle, continued to beg and plead, but nothing worked.

I don’t remember how the dream ended, it felt like I was trapped for an eternity, but it certainly left me with deep feelings of existential dread.",new,Dreams that won’t let you wake up,1.0

I was having a normal dream before it, I don't quite remember it but it was uneventful and something that if I was to wake up I would forget it shortly. But I distinctly remember the transition from Dream to Whatever The Hell This Was.

It began to happen in the kitchen of my old house. For some context: the walls in my kitchen are 75% windows, facing out into a white picket fence that's in front of the woods. It's in suburbia so my neighbors also have a similar backyard layout. This means that on the right and left you can see the woods go down for a while. 

So there was this young guy, about my age, who was a new neighbor who happened to have left his keys in the house. Now, I've never seen this kid under any context as far as I can remember in my waking life, and trust me, I would've remembered this guy. (I really thought I was gonna get it in this dream, huh.)

So we start talking little ways in front of the kitchen windows, my back facing them. We're having a normal conversation about like, the neighborhood or whatever. In the middle of it, the guy's face drops and the blood leaves his face. He's looking behind me and goes: ""What the hell is that?""

I whip my head around, and standing (perfectly still), dead center, IN the trees is a man. Kinda. 

He basically looks human, he's not abnormally skeletal or anything-- but he's sheet white, bald, no eyebrows, with extremely light, glowing iris's. He's wearing a suit with a long jacket. And he's staring right at us.

At first, for some reason, I think that I need evidence. I look down to take a camera out of my pocket.

 When I look back up at the window, the sky is grey. The trees are barren. There's a terrifying mist. And he is everywhere. In different positions, but all in the trees. The original Man is still motionless in the dead center, but now there are thousands of him as far as I could see. The neighbor I was with makes the sane choice and begins to RUN. I turn to see the guy run, and look back out. 

Everything's back to normal, but the original Man is still there. Now, he's on the ground. I look down at the camera, like if I took a picture I'd be safe, or something. I look back up, he's closer. I fumble with the camera. I look back up, he's inside. I turn back to the camera, look up and he's right in front of me.

He stands incredibly close and kindly says something along the lines of (though, I'm pretty confident this is it): ""This is where it ends for us."" He touches my cheek, and I wake up.

I woke up with the feeling like I wasn't supposed to tell anyone about what I just saw. So, of course, I immediately call my dad. I was okay, until I got to the part where the man appeared and I started to cry. Like, I feel like I'm not supposed to be telling people what happened to me. 

It's been a month and while I think about it all the time I have yet to have a remotely similar dream. I've been plagued with night terrors and whatnot my whole life, so normally a spooky dream-- no matter how ""real"" feeling, is something I can kinda throw in the back of my mind.

I'm quasi religious but not particularly concerned about hell or demons, and when I was a kid i was interested in spirituality, but the whole ""energy"" thing seems pretty kooky to me now.

At any rate, it was a pretty overwhelming experience, and I woke up absolutely freaked out. In the moment of the dream it just felt so real, like I was actually feeling these experiences.

So my cat woke me up at 4:30am and she started knocking stuff over, so i booted her out and closed my door.

I was really restless for a while and then i guess i knocked out because I'm in this hallway (and i know things transpired before this moment, I just cant remember what happened) and I am running from something. I remember knowing that I was gonna die if I didnt get away. And there were other people in the room with me. And then this thing is there and I remember asking it what it was and I think it said it was a fallen angel? and then it just started draining my energy and there was blood pouring out my neck and I was kicking and screaming and trying to get away, and then i fall to the ground, and am like slow crawling but its still draining me, and I dont know if I call out to God or what, but there is this man named Gabriel who whisks me away back to my room and puts like a seal around me.

And I/the monster is being attacked by two glowy beings and I remember being right outside my real life house just fading into the darkness and into the other realm. And then I/the monster is in space absorbing the cold and the void to regain its energy and everything gets really deep and philosophical but its goal is to still get into my house and absorb me. It then goes to my house and my dad lets it in and remember floating up my stairs and into my room and looking at my body on the bed and then my alarm goes off, and I wake up.

Then some off-brand police force decided it was illegal to have these ferrets, and started trying to take ours (some of the other people in the neighborhood/mall that I was living in also had some). 

This mall-neighborhood was sort of an upscale shanty town inside of a mall that catered to well-off consumers. I lived in a fancy changing room in a cluster of other identical abodes. These changing rooms were circular with dark walls that went all the way to the ceiling. They were probably 3-4 times the square-footage of regular mall changing rooms, but they were nicer and carpeted. They weren’t attached to each other, just situated close together. In my particular area of the mall, it was mostly single-person residents who were young - as in, kids and teens. I think I was an older teen. 
Thing was, the mall still had plenty of patrons, who mostly just ignored us residents as we navigated through clothing racks and departments to do our own thing. 

You had to go down to this half-concrete ravine, half-dirt creek to find the ferrets to train in the first place. The way you drew a ferret to you was by digging out a plastic POP! Vinyl doll from the muck and silt on the dirt side of the creek.  Then you would train them over the course of 3 sessions until they became loyal to you. After you were finished training, you would have to complete a short survey. The faster you answered the questions right, the more powerful your ferret would be. 

When I brought my ferret home for the first time, someone had set up a table next to my hovel, and they were having a Magic the Gathering tournament. I don’t play Magic, even if my dreams, but I know some of the basics. Anyway, one patron was a whiz at the game, and he beat everyone that challenged him. He had beat some of the child-residents, and they were not happy about it. I’m pretty sure he had also insulted them and was all-around a bad sport. 

When my neighbors saw me, they insisted I challenge this douchebag and show him up. I tried to explain that I didn’t know how to play, let alone that I would be any good at it. But they insisted, as did the challenger, so I borrowed someone’s deck and started to play. Well, it turns out one of my ferret’s powers was to enhance my strategic abilities, or something, and I ended up beating the kid at his own game. He threw a tantrum, naturally. 

Later, a couple of the kids were going back to the river to start training a second ferret. I joined them, because I liked the idea. This is where we encountered the off-brand police who insisted we couldn’t have these extraordinary ferrets, for whatever made-up reason. I was afraid that they would try to take my original ferret. So I just went home.

Last night, I had this very disturbing dream about a mass suicide. The dream started out very casually : I was at a party with alot of my friends, current ones and there were even some surprisingly old friends who I haven't seen much. And then suddenly there were all these people that I didn't recall know (friends of friends, or just seen on social media) that were there. So I was greet one such girl, and she somehow hits my face and I in self-defense, accidentally scratch her nose, leaving a small mark.

Fast forward a little bit, I'm on the terrace, still at the party when I'm confronted by this girl (the nose scratch) and her mother and they want to be admit that I intentionally attacked her and kept persuading me. I kept saying that it was an accident and just a self defense impulse and the scratch wasn't even big, it'd heal in a bit. But they kept pushing and before I know, I'm surrounded by alot of people, all asking me to admit and accusing me. And then, some start insulting me and then start attacking me. Then some started saying 'let's beat him up/kill him'. All these people were the ones that I didn't really know personally. In desperation, I scream 'where are my friends, is nobody going to help me?!'. So that's when some friends come and say that the others will have to kill them before they can get to me.

This is when the dream gets weird, everyone just starts climbing the ledge and jumping off: my friends, enemies and even the random people. The weirdest part is that I see myself jumping off from a third person perspective. Then there's this last person left, who is a friend of my old boss. Anyways, he wanted to jump but couldn't muster the courage. So, I help him and that's it. Everyone is dead.

The dream ends with me looking down the ledge and seeing that it is a lake /ocean down there and it is convering what used to be a road. As I walk the edge of the ledge, I can see just one pair of legs laying underwater, under some cinderblocks but no faces or bodies.

So in 90% of my dreams im lucid and able to act, but i usually let them play out unless it's going somewhere bad, so i know what's going on. I find myself in some city apartment, a little above the standard building heights and the wall in front of me is made of glass and framing. It's snowing out and i turn around to see a well decorated and homely Christmas theme. It's was then i became fully aware i was in the dream. There was some woman sitting on the red couch just relaxing in front of the fireplace. I look at her confused, she felt, real. Not like the other people in my dreams where they feel hollow or fake when i see them, but she seemed tangible. She looks at me and cocks her head a bit and smiles warmly. I smirk back and she stands up and walks over to the window and stands next to me. ""It's rather pretty out tonight isn't it?"" I glance outside and tell her it is. I look at her and she looks at me, I had enough of that take feeling and ask if she's dreaming too, she answered ""probably"" with a happy little smile. I look out the window to get a glimpse of the snow in the night and everything snaps away, next thing i know im awake in my room. ",new,Others in my dreams?,2.0

I don't have OCD but I do feel like everything has to be in the right place at all times. So it started with two little metal marbles falling right in to a hole. Then I was in my room but my rug was grass everything else was the same tho. Then I saw I bigger metal ball fall down on to the grass. Then I turned around I think in real life idk but it was quiet for what felt like hours. I turned around again and when I looked at my floor it was the same but it was all messed up and out of place. I started screaming in my mind what did you do. Then everything started moving around and there were like wrecking balls rolling all around. There were like a trillion different colors flashing constantly. After that it was all silent and I was in a hotel but I was confined to like 10 feet and it kept looping over and over.

I was back in my hometown after the festival and being chased/stalked, etc. My hometown is a lovely college town, with sweet little restaurants, etc. 

So, what I remember of last night's dream was being in a pizza shop with a friend and a movie was being released that was filmed in town. I remember discussing the movie before going to see it, while we ate and how the movie was supposed to be really evocative of the unique nature and style of our little town.

Then I remember seeing the movie, I don't remember what it was about, but the last shot was of a big oak tree covered with fall/orange leaves and three ghosts being in the top part of the tree. 

After the movie I got on the town tram (there isn't really one) and was thinking about how everyone used the tram instead of walking on the sidewalks and how much more efficient it was that way. 

After that it is pretty jumbled up, the tram, the movie, the pizza place. But that movie shot with the tree and ghosts has really stuck with me.

I was at my parents house in the middle of a vicious ice storm. Only this was no ordinary ice storm. As the ""ice"" fell, I saw that it was actually tiny, tiny gems that sparkled brightly, like diamonds. When the storm ended, every inch of the property was covered in an brilliant coat of white that shined with hues of blue and pink, much like the result of a real ice storm. It was so beautiful.

I went outside to collect some of this precious ""ice"". As I picked up chunks, I discovered different stones underneath. These stones were larger; shaped like rectangles. They had the most gorgeous blue sheen to them, like the iridescent quality of [labradorite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labradorite), only with less green tints.

Do you need help finding it? 

Then we start this fucking scooby-doo mystery shit where we look around the brothel going in random rooms some had people having sex or rooms full of random shit like one room just had a bunch of shoes idk why. Then we ran into a Naked lady that told us that she thought she saw someone with the broach in the western part of the Brothel,The Asian lady asked the new naked lady if she can help us find it THEN we somehow had like 12 naked or near naked lady's trying to find the stupid fucking broach. Then while searching i run into my brother and the blonde lady,they looked tired (ALMOST LIKE THEY HAD SEX OR SOMETHING UNLIKE ME but i digress) I look at my brother and he has the broach clenched in his right hand, The Asian lady walks up and gets the broach from my brother and she turns to me and says:

Thanks for helping find my broach BUT you and your brothers time is up.Then they proceeded to lead us out of the brothel and shut the doors behind us and my brother turns and asks : Did you have a good time?

I wake to sound of my alarm going off and i sit up and think about how fucking stupid i was in the dream for not being able to have sex in a brothel.

It’s pretty short and simple.  I had a dream where I was in Italy, somewhere warm and coastal, and I was in a white house or building.  The room I was in was very tall with a spiral staircase behind it.  It was all white, and there were windows with a little sunlight shining through.  

In front of the staircase was a white marble statue of two baby angels.  They were vertically on top of each other, slightly displaced horizontally, and positioned as if they were in flight. The statue also had this blue “ribbon” of glass spiraling around the angels.  The shade of blue was like azure and turquoise.  I remember in the dream thinking the blue glass represented water, like it was supposed to be like a water-less fountain.  In the dream all I did was just admire the statue.

Then they told everyone to keep your dead at home, in the coolest area of your house and wait for removal as the sites were getting to filled up. They then shut down all public works and facilities and told everyone to stay home except when absolutely necessary to prevent further spread.

I was living alone and had stocked up food and water (I actually do have a stock of food and water for emergencies) so I wasn't too worried. However, I was apparently friends with the neighbors and they all died except for the little boy. I decided to help him and placed the bodies of his family members in their garage for pick up.

Time moved forward about a week and there was no pick up. Food had started getting more scarce and people were breaking into homes. The boy and I ventured out to grab some supplied, but found all of the stores had been raided of everything. Not even clothing was left on racks. He and another little boy got into a vicious fight over an ugly backpack and when both the other boy's father and I came around the corner, we saw that we were both carrying guns and told our wards to let it go and follow. 

Time jumped ahead again and it was a now a few weeks in. We still had plenty of food, but water was getting lower. All around the neighborhood there was only silence with the occasional gun shot or breaking glass. I knew the day was coming when someone would try to break in. So I loaded my guns and had one on me at all times. 

Finally, a group of men came over the fence and were trying to get into my garage. I shot in the air, and two ran off but one turned to look at me. I realized that all of them, the men, were infected and just trying to survive. What I didn't know was that the disease caused their skin to rot on their bodies. The man looked at me and had a large necrotic lesion on his face. I pointed the gun at him and told him to leave. He had anger and sadness in his eyes, but he left.

I then decided to check on the bodies of the boy's family in his house. I found the neighbors' garage door broken open. I went inside of the garage, which was thick with the smell of decay. After my eyes adjusted, I could see the tarps in the low light of the garage. I counted three times to be sure, there were only 3 lumps, not 4. One of the bodies had gone missing.

I never met my great grandmother. She passed in feb of 98’ and I was born in oct of 98’ so we just missed each other. I have a very very big family and I was the first baby born after she passed away. To this day, she has 75 great grandkids. Growing up I was always told I would act like her and I would pick out clothes that she would like and we had very similar taste and now that I’m older, I’m being told I look identical to her. There has been a few times I’ve been mistaken for her in pictures. 
She passed away at home and of natural causes and her whole family was there and making her comfortable. Now the dream was that I would walk to my great aunts house (my great aunt is my favorite relative I have) and my great grandma lived there and after school I would take care of my grandma and watch her since she was bed ridden. (My great grandma’s younger sister is still alive. She’s 104 and I visit her all the time and she always rubs my hands and kisses them both. They both always used to do that apparently.) I would sit beside my grandma and she would rub my hand and tell me how soft my skin was and kiss my hand and caress my cheek and that kinda repeated for a few days. I would go to school and then go and take care of her. Then one day, she was gone. Not in the room anymore. She had passed away. It broke my heart. Then I woke up.

As me and my cousin (who are in real life estranged) found him we helped him out of the water but he was lying there without beeing able to move for about 3 days.

One leg already 'dissolved' because of the chemicals in the water. He must've felt how all the chemicals burnt away parts of his flesh and even bones but yet he was unable to do anything about it.

As we helped him up he stood there on one leg as if nothing happened, the chemicals attacked his brain and he has gotten completely insane.

I dreamed about everyday of him lying there in endless pain, waiting for help but no one bothered about it. It was so common, the people in this area had to fight for their own in this corrupt state, praying that they don't end up like him.

After trying to help him he just told us nonsense stuff but seeing a totally fine person with a family, going insane in such a realistic dream was so heart-shattering for me.

My room was brighter than usual, and the bed felt harder, or rather my body felt less cushioned. My throat was parched and my stomach was empty. I lifted a hand above my face and saw that it was nothing but skin and bones. I tried to get up but my body felt week. I checked my phone and saw that three months had passed without me waking up. My parents were gone, no one had come to check on me. My room was full of cobwebs and my bed smelled of sweat and death. A family of mice had burrowed into my teddy bear (yes I am 19 yes I sleep with a teddy bear.) It was awful. I got up and my legs felt shaky, and I looked into the mirror. I was a skeleton, or I may as well have been so. Worse still, my face had become chalky and white, deep wrinkles cutting into my face. I stepped onto a scale and saw that I weighed 55 pounds.

&#x200B;

In the dream, my house and my grandparents house were across the street from each other. I was walking over late at night when I saw a man with a long pick axe type thing walking my way. I didn't want to seem rude, like I immediately thought he was crazy or something, so I sped up a bit but I didn't run. Then he started talking to me, inching into my grandparents front yard as I stayed up on the porch.

&#x200B;

""Did you hear about that poor kitten that fell in the sewer?"" he asked me.

&#x200B;

""Oh yeah, is he okay?"" I replied.

&#x200B;

""God no, the poor thing suffered for days. Now he's probably dead.""

&#x200B;

At this point, I was beginning to feel really uneasy. Somehow in my dream up until this point, I was under the impression he was kind of a funny guy. But now I was scared. So I went inside and tried to shut the door but he came up and I was so weak I could hardly keep it shut. Then he started stabbing through the door with a long machete type thing over and over.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started screaming my grandma's name (we don't use grandma/grandpa) and after keeping the door shut as long as I could I ran to her room. She was in the midst of waking up and immediately called 911 while I lay on the floor with my feet on the door to keep it shut (I guess I've always said my lower body is stronger than my upper?).

&#x200B;

So she calls 911 and then I see two pairs of feet shuffling around outside in a fight through the crack under the door. It's my grandpa and the man. Eventually my grandpa sticks his head under the door all joking, pretending to be him and we come out. The two of my grandparents are joking about how he's a good-looking, funny guy who'll probably be able to make a comedy of this of some sort-- like he's going on a talk show or something to talk about what happened and he probably won't get in much trouble because he's so charismatic. Then they go to leave and I beg them to wait for me and they realize I'm a bit more shook up about the situation than they thought.

&#x200B;

I woke up after that and at first I was okay. My throat hurt like I'd been screaming in my sleep. And then 5 minutes later, I was sobbing because it was so scary. I don't have anyone to call, so typing this up at least helps a little.

When I was a kid, my parents broke up. I had stayed with aunty for a while. Then back to mum’s side. My mum stayed with my stepfather. But stepfather was quite busy that he only went home on weekends. Mum was busy with her job too.

On a week day night, mum and I were watching a movie, Short Circuit. That was an old one. I fell asleep when watching it.

Before I fell asleep, I still remembered a robot was running after Johnny. Then I dreamed they kept running and running. But it was an asian beautiful lady running after Johnny. I only saw the lady’s back. But she somehow looked like a demon more than a human. She looked back to me. I got scared then woke up.

When I woke up, the robot was still running after Johnny on TV. My mum was in my left side.She fell asleep as well. I felt weird. How come the robot was still after Johnny? I felt I had been sleeping for a while. And I felt someone was in the house as well. But it’s weekday, stepfather was not here.

I don’t know why. But I felt someone was in my right side. I didn’t dare to look. I was just scared. Then my mum woke up as well. She asked me what’s wrong. I told her. And she said she felt the same. We both getting freaked out.

Mum turned all the light on in the house. We didn’t see anything or anyone here. But we did feel something. We turned the TV off and went to bed with the light on.

I kept dreaming the lady all night. She kept looking at me in the dream but I couldn’t recognise her. That was a nightmare.

After a couple of years, my aunty passed away due to cancer. She was mum’s sister. They were very close. Aunty struggled to survive before she died.

My aunty was a nice lovely lady. She had helped many people on anything. She would always do as much as she could. So when she gone, it’s very hard for all of us. My mum missed her a lot.

At one night, I dreamed I was standing on a mountain. There was a castle. I was thinking why I was here. “BANG!!!!!” A huge sound from sky. Many people walked out from the castle. They walked very slowly. Then I saw my aunty!!!!!

I kept yelling my aunty’s name. She saw me and walked to me slowly. I saw fear in her eyes. She was totally wet. Wet hair all in her face. I cried. I kept asking what happened to her, why we were here. She looked scared and told me, “I don’t have a light. I need light.”

I got confused. What was she talking about? I wanted to ask but, “BANG!!!!!!” A huge sound from sky. Aunty rushed to walk back to the castle. Then I woke up.

I was totally confused. Didn’t know what’s happening. Someone opened my door. It’s my mum. She was tearing.

“Your aunty came to my dream. She said she wants light. I asked her which kind of light. She didn’t answer. She was fully wet. I am so sad….” Mum said.

Not joking. I got goose bump all around my body!!! I told mum I got a same dream.

After a couple of days, mum bought many kinds of different torch and light. We didn’t know which kind she wanted. We brought to aunty’s grave. Then we never dreamed her anymore.

Aunty was a really lovely lady. Wish her rest in peace.

So, let's get right to the point. Back in December, I took 5 dried grams of mushrooms and visited my personal hell. As a historically agreeable person, I've always held aggression and disagreeableness at the lowest point in my mind, but have begun to notice increased amounts of both in my waking life. This is, undoubtedly, a revelation of my avoidance of them over time, and they seem to be coming forth from a repressed place that the mushrooms have revealed. I see it as a chance to integrate less agreeable parts of myself in a positive way, but this is proving rather challenging.

Coupled with this, I keep having dreams that hop from hyper-pleasant, often childhood related scenarios, to absolutely demented, homicidal ones wherein I'm committing the killings. Here were my dreams the last two nights:

Pleasant, but mournful -  a mother bear and her cub giddily laughing followed by the children's show ""Franklin"" theme song playing very audibly. I then saw myself as a four legged beast howling in pain. I then awoke.

Unpleasant - I was on a flaming planet and swimming across a dark lagoon to a gothic castle with a friend when I looked back and saw a woman on the shore with a little ghoulish henchman at her side. He started swimming out after as if to catch us, but I turned around and swam back at him while wielding a dagger, and he proceeded to try and flee back to the woman. I caught up to him before he reached the shore and violently stabbed him to death in the water. The woman on the shore screamed in terror and I awoke.

So, it seems like my psyche, being composed of mostly conflict avoidant, uber-optimistic views of myself and the world is struggling to make sense of this newfound disagreeableness. Additionally, the first dream makes me think I'm longing for childhood or some semblance of the joy that characterized it to counterbalance this aggression. From what I've read, murder dreams can allude to something in your life changing rapidly or the need to ""kill something off"". Maybe there's a link?

&#x200B;

Either way, the struggle is real right now, and any insight into these developments would be super appreciated!

The dream started with everyone telling me I had to watch this new show out on Netflix — I don’t remember the name, just that it was one of those “must see” things. The show started off like a regular sitcom but by the end of the first episode the protagonist went in to the bathroom and walked through a full body mirror. At this point, the dream switched perspectives and I started experiencing everything in the first person / as myself. 

A voice called out to me, “Let me teach you of reality” and I was in this big room of nothingness. Just blackness, and then some fog started rolling in and little yellow lights lit up to guide me where to go. The voice called out again as I walked. “Follow.” It sounded like 15 different voices at once, and the lights led me to a door. When I opened it, I was in some home I’ve never been in before and I started walking up the stairs. 

As I got closer to the bedroom door on the second floor, I could hear the same voice chanting over and over again in a monotone. “Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood.” This went on for what felt like hours in real time, but I woke up before I could open the door. When I tried going back to sleep, I just kept hearing the same chanting. “Blood. Blood. Blood. Blood.” No visuals to the dreams this time, just a sense of dread and the chanting nonstop and a faint red light eveey time the word “Blood” was said until I finally woke up for good to get ready for work.

My mom shouts ""Plastiq, look!"" and I look up to the sky. The moon is 4x the size that it should be. I feel unnerved and all background noise ceases.

About 2 years back, I had this dream where I got knocked over by a vehicle and I died. After dying, a lighted spark left my body. **I became the lighted spark**. I was looking over at all the blood around my body and I started to panic. Right when I was panicking, I (lighted spark) just shot up to the sky and into space. It was until I was looking down on earth that I felt like my mind was about to explode and I woke up. My heart was beating so hard.

So... Few weeks back, I had another dream where I was running away from someone (apparently it looked like Guan Yu.. lol). I got cornered and I realised he was holding a weapon (either a sword or a spear like Guan Yu's). I fell and was on my knees. I think I was laughing and crying at the same time. I don't remember saying anything to the dude, he just looked quite angry. I closed my eyes and he sliced my head off. It was really weird. My head fell off and the blood was everywhere. My headless body was spazzing a little before it just collapsed too. After awhile I woke up and have been thinking about it ever since.

Is there anyone here who can help me discover why I even dreamt about such thangs?

""No, you can't have that"" I say to the kid. Ignored. I pull the bottle out of his tiny hands and put it down. I gently push the child back through the door


""It's not like you need it"" the man says, as he starts to bend down, reaching for the bottle.

**January 1st - ""A phantom in the opera""**

>I was the lead role in the phantom of the opera. My voice was weak. Walking through the cast softly singing music of the night. Show starts and my costume is not correct. I miss my shoes. A girl in curly hair assists me. Transitioning from dream to dream. I am some sort of sailor. Most of it is gone from memory. The dreams end with me visiting the deathbed of an astronaut. He dies and I bawl my eyes out. 

* Off to a great start, this is so long ago that I have forgotten most of the context. The Phantom of the opera does pop up now and then in the next month. 

**January 2nd- ""A Jewish Scooter""**

>\[garbled mess\] orange and get fuel. Turns out its a date. At the movies. Used a scooter to go up the elevator. I am the bar mitzvah boy. I become the leader of a horror movie. I can't watch it because it is scary. I got the bathroom instead. 

* There are many instances of my handwriting being too god awful to read. Sometimes I can't see when I am writing at night and the lines overlap. In this dream, I vaguely remember the horror movie. Apologies for a lack of context, these were a while ago. 

**January 3rd- ""A garbled slew of dreams""**

>\-Game analysis with Fineolgd.   
>  
>\-Reading a Lovecraft action book. The job is to get food. He is disappointed with my presentation. SAT scores are delivered, 90% don't get it  
>  
>\-Eating lunch and made fun of for eating ham. He is absent so go to her. Bunch of space stuff on the wall. Mess around with some friends in chess. Play simul with Eric Rosen.  
>  
>\-The school is like a forest. See an old firefighter memorial. See eagle scout ceremony (paper scout). The big event is happening with work. got to the mall to relax. A childhood friend is there. He says on the finger punch therapy to break your arm.   
>  
>\-Become cookie monster  
>  
>\-Run around adventure ark and make rock em sock em bots with ham. 

* I am/was really into chess. I played so often and so much that eventually, chess figures seeped their way into my dream world. Finegold is Grandmaster Benjamin Finegold, and Eric Rosen is an international master. A ""paper scout"" is usually a kid who's entitled (usually white) parents skim by the steps and promote their child to eagle scout via the signing of a bunch of forms. Usually, these paper scouts can barely tie a knot. Each dash represents another dream.

>Black receives epaulet. Driving in Seattle many tall buildings. Someone plays a bad move. I take advantage of it. Still in the city with buildings. Get enrolled in some weird snail professor/teacher thing is weird. All my classmates look forced to be there. Start reading bible verses, and start a revolution and leave. Bring the girl back. Can't marry because I am a ghost. Dramatic music of my flying \[garbled mess\]. \[More garbled mess\] teacher gives it life mass. 

* Chess influence is still running rampant here. The ""epaulet"" is a type of mate, and black received it. More bad moves and chess terminology. Now back in my hometown a start a revolution by reciting bible verses. These types of dreams are more common. 

**January 5th- ""Mega mega terry crews""**

>Don't counter with a pawn. Constantly dark. go to McDonald's for some ice cream. The guy at the table has been eating big macs for years straight. Go home and take a shower. Terry crews overdose on liquid Mexican candy. I was his trainer before the big fight.

>  
>\-Returning from other dimensional task force. Something like three months time in two weeks irl. Lots of punching and some ice worlds. 

* Hey, what do you know another chess term? I tend to have dreams where I am working alone or with others on secret missions and have adventures. The alien dream was quite stupid as the color blue was forbidden on the planet. I vaguely remember one of my crew members getting attacked by a dwarf for wearing blue. 

**January 6th- ""Shrimp Camp!'**

>\-Shrimp camp. Many people very little gravity. Bounce really high.   
>  
>\-The first day of school. Miss the fifth period entirely. have a nice candy bar. The table is way too high. Computer class is a mess. Password shows on screen. Eat an anotehr candy bar. 

* Shrimp camp does appear in another dream. It's a place where there is very little gravity and is encased by a massive Chinese skyscraper.

School is under a gas attack. Take another two-day vacation. Decide water is a really good mineral. Make a heavy metal album. It sucks. Dunkey likes meat, Shrek does not. I can run really fast.

0.0,apnw7h,1.0,2.0,"I want to preface this by saying I absolutely *love* cats. From what I understand about dream interpretation, your ""in real life"" feelings about something can drastically alter the meanings of the symbolism in dreams. My love for cats is strong. I have 3 of my own which I consider my own children, have to fight with myself to adopt another, have debated opening a cat rescue for years now, and I have a small collection of feline knickknacks. And don't even get me started on the cat shirts. It's borderline obsession.  


It started roughly a week ago, maybe two, when I started having these random, irrational dreams about, well, cats. The first one I can recall clearly - I was hollering at my cat to get down off the kitchen island, as he was digging around in a dirty pan that was on there (and the pan was on the island in real life, too!) After a few times of him ignoring me, he looks up and says to me, ""There's eggs in here."" I was so flabbergasted that he had spoken to me - in perfectly understandable English! - that it woke me up. His voice was high-pitched, like a child's, but he spoke with fluidity and precision as if he were an adult human. It was odd.

&#x200B;

The others I cannot recall clearly, as they were ones that slipped away quickly upon waking. However, I remember that they all had the same thing in common - *cats.* I never felt threatened, scared, nor uneasy, they just kinda... Were there. Sometimes as a background piece, sometimes more prominent in their appearance in the dream. They never attacked me. Never hissed nor made any indication they were meaning me harm. The only one that had a feline I recognized was the first dream, but the others have all been mysterious kitties I don't recall seeing in my waking life. I know all of them were multicolored in some form or fashion, but I could not tell you specifics breeds or anything. They were all short- to medium-length haired, though. The most recent one, however, I can recall dead felines and rescuing a kitten. This, though, might have something to do with something I was reading that night, as it had the main protagonist rescue a kitten from a trash bag of a dead litter and mother. (Sad, I know; I cried when I read it.)

&#x200B;

I typically try to interpret my dreams myself as the only person who can truly decipher the meaning of a dream is the dreamer, but I have been having trouble with this one, as it seems to be recurring and my love for cats seems to contradict many of what is said about their presence in dreams. I understand the correlation between felines and femininity, which I have assumed is likely what the reasoning is behind it, but it does not make sense to me as to why I would be having recurring symbols in my dreams over something I am fully, 100% aware of in my waking life. (I am having some female ""issues"" that I am currently in the process of attempting to obtain and receive treatment for, to put it simply.)

&#x200B;

As far as I am aware, my spirit guide is not a cat.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure what other information I can give to hopefully get some help on understanding why I am getting so many dreams about cats lately. Any and all help and information would be greatly beneficial. While I would love to dream about kitties all day and night, I know recurring dreams tend to hold significant meaning(s) and my long-standing love for cats has never produced a recurring symbol of felines before.

There were people of all ages from young to adults and I made friends with a little black kid, he was about 9 years old. There was a lot of academy stuff, but it went pretty uneventful. When the class was over I left together with this kid, we went outside, said our goodbyes and at that moment I noticed an old lady who seemed to be with her granddaughter filling some sort of a blank. (She looked like a granny from Madagascar who used to beat everyone with her purse, but realistic with these crazy opened eyes, skinny and with her mouth closed). I started walking away and then the kid shouted “Wait, I forgot my nasal spray in your bag”, so I check my bag, found it and turned around to hand it to him and I saw that this old woman had him in a head lock, then she took out a long thin needle and pierced it through his neck. I had a feeling that it was a race thing what made it even more disturbing. I ran to them, but she ran away, so I took the kid and the blank that she had filled and went back into the academy apartment, I handed the blank to them, explained the situation and by that time I calmed down. It was time to go home so I left and then I saw in 3rd person that she was standing right next to the door as I left, so she was clearly waiting for me (to kill the suspect?), I’m a big guy so I ran to the subway as fast as I could, almost jumped over the set of stairs and went inside. Again, the fact that I ran so fast made me feel save inside the subway, because it would take her 10-20 minutes to cover this distance. I went to the information board to check where I was and in the reflection I saw her standing behind with a needle in her hands, I turned around, she receded and started running. I was terrified not only by how powerful she was in terms of being fast, but also by the fact that she could hunt me down to my home with that kind of power and learn where I live.

I'd found myself standing in a big white enamel bath, dressed in the brown robes of a monk. They were weighty robes, made from hard-wearing material but I don't remember them irritating my skin. I was stood in the lower half, towards the plug hole and I could see a huge crocodile facing me at the opposite end - a very well fed and meaty fucker! - aware of my presence, but in no way in a rush to hurry over. He began sauntering towards me, his scaly belly rubbing against the enamel floor, which produced unpleasant abrasive vibrations I could feel in my feet at the other end. There was a sense of inevitability brewing. Like my demise had already been determined and I was to just here to watch it play out in this dream.

As soon as I caught wind of this design I began to panic, immediately trying to call upon some dormant mystical power within that could get me out of there, or materialise a weapon with which I could kill the croc. But I remember the sinking feeling knowing that neither of these options would be available to me. I wouldn't be able to draw upon any external source to aid my escape. I was powerless, and the cause of my end was a lot closer now, steadily advancing at the same ominous pace - the vibrations underfoot and atonal sounds of the croc's scraping belly really jarring my insides. The crocodile seemed content for me to take as much time as I needed to exhaust all possible escape plans, because it knew all were futile. 

By this point I was balancing tentatively on the grating in the middle of the plughole as attempts to climb up the sides all resulted in my sliding gently back down towards it.

Then a realisation about what I should do came to me. What I was most afraid of was not being rendered dead, but the indignity of dying in this way - excruciating pain and my desperate screams for help reverberating in a cold sterile chamber as the crunching and popping of my bones in the crocodile's jaws violated my ears with a quality which was beyond intimately vivid. No fucking way can I let this happen! So I detached my mind from my body. Disconnected the two somehow. It was only when I needed to that I knew how to. I relinquished my body to the crocodile while I remained present as spirit, conscious of what was taking place around me, but not physically connected. Uncoupled from all pain. I could hear the grunting and wheezing as the crocodile devoured my flesh wrapped in bloodied robes - but the flesh nor the robes belonged to me anymore.

0.0,apnepd,0.0,2.0,"My fiance and I had finally moved into our own house. We got everything set up and got everything looking like a home. We were happy and ready for this next big step in our lives. It was just a normal day for us. A big day, but a normal day. Everything felt so real. I could feel him breathing, I could feel the joy of moving into a house and I could smell outside and the new house. Everything was okay until we turned on the T.V. We have never had cable and we always end up watching Netflix or Hulu while we eat dinner or while we just chit chat about our day, which is what we were preparing to do. However, there was a news broadcast on. We were confused because we were unsure how we could be getting this message because again, we didn't have cable and we weren't on any stations. The only thing said over and over again was ""Warning... Meteor impact in two hours. Please remain indoors or find shelter."" My heart sank. I could feel despair and dread. My fiance grabbed me and held tight as we tried to make sense of what we were hearing. It was a rollercoaster of feelings. ""This had to be a joke"" ""Why wouldn't they say something sooner about this?"" There wasn't even going to be enough time to cope with death, to see family, talk to family. There was nothing I could do. Everything was going to be gone, nothing was going to exist, nothing mattered and no one will remember or be able to discover that we existed. Just everything is gone forever and there was nothing anyone could do about it. I couldn't stop crying and screaming. I wanted to just get it over with, thoughts of suicide filled my head but my fiance convinced me to ride it out, to just be with him and try and enjoy the last hour we have together. But I couldn't relax, I couldn't cope, I couldn't be calm. Nothing mattered anymore. I had realized how pointless life had been. To exists was pointless. Everyone's thoughts, feelings, troubles. Nothing mattered and it was going to end. 

I decided to call my mom to at least tell her I love her. My mother and I have always had a super rocky relationship. When she picked up she seemed to want to apologize for many things and talk to me about things that just... Didn't matter. I wasn't really sure what to tell her, I'm not religious, and this event wasn't going to change that. On the other hand, my mother is religious, so the only thing I could say, while she was crying and saying things that were inconceivable, I just said ""I love you, I will see you soon."" and hung up. There was no possible way I could physically see her within the time frame before death and telling her this was not calming in the slightest.

So until the meteor crashed into earth and wiped the planet out of the solar system, my fiance and I held each other as I cried. When it finally hit there was no pain. Just dread. 

&#x200B;

I woke up screaming when the meteor hit. Scrambling around to find someone I live with. I have 2 roommates. My fiance was out in the living room but came into the bedroom as soon as he heard me and held me as I mumbled and tried to tell him what happened. I was so confused, I thought I was there and I had no idea where I was. I just woke up as me, but not me. I forgot I had roommates, I didn't know where I was or what was going on. I kept asking him questions, trying to find answers until I finally calmed down and started to understand that it was just a dream. But it was so real that I just couldn't accept that it didn't happen. I still am having issues coping with it. It all felt so real, I died, everyone died and now I am just here.  

It's been a few weeks now since I woke up from this dream, but it still haunts me. Ever since it happened I have felt so lifeless. I do have depression and I have been on medication for a while now, but I don't even feel like that helps me anymore. Therapy is hardly doing anything, I just feel like there is no reason to be here. I can't convince myself that anything matters and I just can't help but feel so helpless and horrible. You would think that after something like this you might feel like you appreciate everything more and want to spend more time with the people you love... But this isn't the case. I can't go a day without thinking of suicide or the death of everything. I just look at everything and feel like I am looking at more useless things, oblivious to the world around them and I really wish I could feel that again. I don't want to feel like this and I just wish I could go back to normal. 

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if that was dark, but I wanted to share it because I haven't really talked to anyone about it other than my therapist and my fiance.

I was looking up at the moon, it was a cresent, and I think I was drunk. After I looked up I just started spinning up against the wall. 

Like back against the wall then stomach then back over and over.

Then I was in the bus and was donating blood( I used to frequently donate blood). The donating bag was full but the person said ""just a little more"".

I said ""can you do the other arm this one is getting sore"". They said "" ok that's fine""

So then they move to my other arm and could only find a deep vein. So they stuck the needle in and then pinched some of my arm and was positing the needle.

While that was happening another person looked over the person who was adjusting the needle and said ""your doing a deep vein dissection?""

The person adjusting the needle got it set and a little blood started flowing and then it stopped.

After that I woke up.

For example: Most of my dreams I fall asleep and wake back up, IN THE SAME DREAM. I can spend days in the dream world in a single night.  Its really cool but also pretty stressful.

Almost every time I realize I am dreaming because something in my “dream life” is not on par with my real life. I state out loud “I am dreaming” or “I’ve got to be dreaming.” And the people surrounding me in my dream convince me otherwise every time. They call me crazy, or straight up tell me “YOU’RE NOT DREAMING.” 

Last week I must’ve fell asleep and woken back up in the same dream 3 time. Meaning I spent 3 days in one dream (if that makes sense). I had to fully convince myself that the world I was living in was my reality. That the dream world was my real world. 

The only thing that seems to knock me back awake seems to be stress. When the dream gets too stressful it shakes me back into the real world.

I decided to work from home today, but I got lazy and decided to take a nap. I kinda just went to sleep, and in my dream, I was at a church and mass was just ending. I was leaving, when I suddenly screamed and got yelled at by the priest, and I left the church. It all happened very quickly. I decided to go home, and on my way there, I started to make different choices and not really going home. I started looking around me, and noticed I couldn't read street signs and my walk home seemed pretty odd. There was something off. I just started running around trying to read street signs, and thats when it hit me. I was in a dream. 

&#x200B;

After realizing that, I just started to look around me and realized there were other people, animals, etc. I saw a lady walking by, and decided to follow her. I screamed ""Hello!"" at her, and I saw some birds on the floor just disintegrate before my eyes (Thanos style), and ran after the lady. She just ignored me, so I left. I decided I'd teleport back to the church entrance, and there I was. I then decided to run around downtown and do random things. I went into buildings, created holes on the floors of the building to see below. At one of the floors, there were these three guys inside a burger joint. There was a sign that said I'm sure my brain tried to make ""Burgers"", but what I saw was more of a variation of that (sort of like ""Bursghers"", ""Bfklsrgersed""). I decided to try and talk to the people, and since there was a hole I could just jump down. I was scared cause I didn't wanna fall, but I just made myself float down safely. It was like levitating but more like falling gently like a feather.

&#x200B;

I got to the guys, but all they said were ""dragon"" in different tones, as if that was their language ""dragon drAgOn DRAGON??"" ""DraGON!"". I thought they were weird so I just left the store lol. On my way out one of them yelled out ""Tolkien!"" (I've never read his books so idk what that was about) I was pretty overwhelmed by everything going on. I decided to run back home again. There were no cars, so I wasn't worrying about crossing the street and stuff, so I was just running freely. That's when it hit me: ""Wait why am i running? Im in a dream, I can fly!"" and I decided to try to fly. I started myself with a run, and just jumped and pushed myself off of the ground. It was working. It was f\*cking working! I was flying.

Well, I didn't know how to fly. I couldn't control it. I kind of freaked out (I have fear of heights) and lost control of myself.

Okay so I (25 F) have had a repeating theme in my dreams that are quite strange. Of course, I’ve done a bit of research about the ‘meaning’ and haven’t found anything relevant, necessarily. 

So, I thought I’d bring it to you guys to get your thoughts and opinions of it. 

I don’t recall dreams every single night and I’m not seeing this theme in every dream... But it’s happened enough times for it to be somewhat puzzling. 

**Basically, I’m standing straight up or walking. And I’ll be attempting to do some normal task – like walk up the stairs – run in a drill or exercise – something like that. And my feet will lift up behind me and begin to float, my legs will follow, and I’m basically placed in a handstand position. I don’t float up further. It’s like the lower half of my body loses its gravitational pull.**

**For instance, when I was trying to walk up the stairs in my dream last night… I was holding on to the rail of the stairs while my legs floated up behind and over my head. I was pulling myself downwards to get my feet back on the ground, and they would only stay when I was exerting pressure. Otherwise they float back up and I just kind of exist there. I can still use my arms and torso to sort of navigate… but my ‘lower half’ is pretty much useless. Eventually, after some time, my legs will return to the ground.**

**But it has been a topic of conversation with the people that are in my dream – I remember feeling embarrassed and confused. Sometimes onlookers appear to be dumbfounded, asking questions – if I’m okay. Other dreams, people around me will react is if it’s something normal. Like it’s a fit of hiccups. And it sucks for me that it's happening in public.**

The ‘first time’ I had this dream, the next morning it felt like I’d had it 100 times before. So… I was unsure if it was actually happening over and over. 

\^ I really have no idea whether this was the first time I had the dream or not. But I’ve only been aware of this dream for about 3 weeks.

After last night, I’m positive that it is a reoccurring theme – and other ‘non-recalled’ dreams have started coming back to me with a similar ‘floating legs’ issue. 

You guys are welcome to ask me any questions – I’m honestly at a loss and the repetitiveness is making me feel a little weird..

So I've been having a LOT more premonitory dreams as of late and all have to do with a central theme: me getting arrested. In fact, my mom said she had a waking vision of me in jail a few days ago. I've been having at least one dream per night where I'm being arrested at random times.

There's no indication of any crime (I don't even pirate music...) nor is there anything happening in the dreams. The cops are already on scene but the only thing that's happening is I'm being handcuffed in different ways. I wake up before being placed in the police car so I never actually get processed or incarcerated in the dreams.

I don't know why I'm experiencing these dreams but I don't even download music illegally. I have no outstanding tickets or fines of any sort. Is there some underlying message I'm missing? I'm never able to see the officers' faces and the only thing they've said to me is ""fish tank"" in one of the dreams. This dream in particular they put a set of cuffs on each wrist but didn't cuff me to anyone or anything and then let me go.

I never wake in a frenzy or panic and it can't happen irl, like I said the only thing I do that's illegal is cross the street without a crosswalk. I am currently feeling held back in my situation, could that be it?

We were evacuated into this big dining hall area, more like a function room but I saw this red dot laser going around aiming at someone. Surprise there was a sniper on another building trying to kill one of the persons inside. Anyways I got out of the hall grabbed my sniper rifle from my work area, imagine Halo’s sniper rifle. Came back and started to aim back at the sniper, but he saw me. So there was this whole back and forth of me trying to aim to kill him but he was quicker, I almost got shot, in fact he shot my gun. It made a round indent like a bb pellet but it was deep enough to go through your skull. 

Anyways I then found my friend, she was in a different room doing some other science thingy but I was like “don’t go near the windows”
And she was like “kk” and walked away lol

Now I  found this other window looking outside.  it was beside the dining room to the left so the sniper was on an angle to the right. he’s still aiming his gun at the dining room so I crawl towards the new window. I can see him now, he looks a bit like Snake but less scars and less beard.

1. I'm with my dad, and there is a zombie outbreak. We have to escape out of town a couple miles out, and we find a grocery store. In the grocery store we find a bunch of food and shit, so were happy. We pack eggs, bread, milk granola bars, jerky, and other stuff. We walk over to a bass and pro shop to get supplies when we meet other people, specifically my classmates. We decide to join up and leave the state because its pretty fucking infected and food is running out.
So we get the supplies like guns knives and shit and we head out. On our way we hit the fucking jackpot, a mall. We loot the mall for what it has and then i see a gamestop and i go in. I grab myself a Nintendo switch and earbuds and go back to getting food. In the dream i have never seen a zombie.

2. In this dream i was in a house with a couple classmates, and there weren't zombies, but the best way I could explain them is the people who have seen the monsters from bird box. So our main problem in the dream is food. Ive seen a couple of deermeatfordinner youtube videos, so i start fishing in a stream close to the house, and i find a good sized catch. I cook it and clean it and everyone eats good, so we decide what our roles would be. Later a child is in our house for some reason and im super suspicious, everyone else thinks it's fine though. She ends up attacking and killing two of the classmates thats I dont remember. I revenge kill her and dump her into the lake that I fished in.

&#x200B;

I have reccuring dreams with different plots.

I don't remember when they started but they are a part of my life as much as anything else.

Sometimes they repeat themselves, sometimes they switch perspective while telling the same story and sometimes they play the next episode of the story.

The only thing they have in common can be summed up in two words: discovery and adventure.

That and the fact that sometimes i get an irl deja vu of the ""wait! i've dreamed of this place even tho i've never been here before "" variety.

Don't get me wrong... it's not **precise** by any means. I don't dream of a particular building and then BAM! it's there. Rather it's something that reminds me of that building(the environment, the color, the setting, etc).

It's a feeling. It doesn't happen the next day/week or month like clockwork or anything. The irl revelation is completely random. But when it happens, the dots connect, so to speak, and i instantly remember the dream where it happened.

I've come to identify them as chapters of my life. A way to validate that i'm going in the right direction, if you will...

At some point(I have to add it was like really fast forward, as if I was hurrying to finish the dream before I woke up) I got really angry with ""person"" and I realised I don't love him and I can't ruin my life marrying him. So we were all(him, his mom, grandma, aunt, my mom, my bro and me) outside, on this huge patio and I could finally catch a glimpse of his HUGE house, it was like a 30 bedroom mansion, and my family were mad with him, from what I later understood was the age gap (\~20years) and I snapped and sent everyone home while I had a conversation with him. I had to repeat myself and they understood and left. So we ""teleport"" to the bedroom, more exactly to the dressing room, and he sits on an ottoman and I scream and throw like jewelery and diamonds and clothes at him. At this point this person  is trying to make me feel bad, asking if it wasn't all enough. And I scream out loud that ""This person isn't me. I don't recognize myself. This is not me."" And is all awfully silent. After a break of whatever time, I see I climb the stairs of hia house, looking all expensive and brand new, I pass by his mom or aunt and I hear ""Finally the mistress is home"" and I head to the bathroom, lead there by his grandma, where he just got a towel around his waist, and I hug him.

The first dream: I was dreaming about my grandfather (we were close) and spending time with him, then all of a sudde. I started crying (in my dream) and felt this hand and or presence  touch my shoulder while I was sleeping. I woke up still crying and my brother just as I woke up opened the door to tell me our grandpa passed away. I told him I already knew even though I was asleep. Sorry for the lack of details, that's all I remember myself. I wish I could explain it more but everything I typed is all I can remember.

As for the second dream: My family, friends and I were at a party of some sorts, everything was blurry, the photos, the theme of the party, the food, the location etc., the only things that weren't blurry was the people and small minute details like the table cloth patterns, the color scheme. Faces I've never seen before were there interacting with one another, except everyone was sad. I couldn't figure out why. I then forgot about this dream until one day. You see, a few days later my nephew passed away and a week after that we were at my brother's ex-girlfriends house celebrating his life. And then everything started to become unblurry. The location, the food, the theme, the photos, the color scheme started to make sense, the table cloths matched perfectly with those in my dream and even the people I had never met before that appeared in my dream were there. It freaked me out. I soon remembered the first dream woth my grandpa and then this one with my nephew. I never told anyone about this stuff.

0.0,apgzyd,0.0,2.0,"TLDR: My girl and I have temporarily stopped talking 2 months ago. Dreamt of 2 girls who started talking to me and assumed I'd be with them. I just went along with it. 


A little background info:
I rarely talk to or see these 2 girls. Actually if anything I'll just say hi.  I am having some trouble with my current SO. Actually we don't talk anymore and we plan on talking in March, since she is not around me ATM. The two girls will be D and N. My SO is R. Me and R usually dream of each other at the same time. 

Dream:
The dream starts off with a bunch of friends and acquaintances. A lady comes, separates the girls from the guys, and has a talk with them. As she talks with them R is texting as if we have no problems. Once the talk was over, D comes and sits next to me all awkwardly. She texts my manager then shows me the texts, assuming this is how she got my number. Afterwards she starts to text me, even though we're right next to each other. It's as if immediately she assumed we'd be together, and I just went along with it. R is still texting I'm not replying as fast. D assumes we're getting married. We look at my place and I show her around. She makes suggestions and I start thinking of places where we could do the deed. N starts to pop up and starts talking to me. She magically assumes I'm with her. While I'm attending some class with her, R and D, but mainly D, is texting me. D specifically writes ""I know you watch that garbage called porn that every man watches but I still love you."" I could not make out what R was writing. The dream ends with me spending time with N, but texting D.

I'm sort of in this weird building, not well lit and there's this gazebo, a staircase and lots of boxes and walls in random places. Apparently it's like a firing range, I have an AK-47 in my hands and there's all kinds of other people in really dark clothing, covering them head to toe. 

We're running around, shooting at each other, I'm using this gun like if I were some professional marksman, I aim and tap lightly, weirdly enough there's no blood nor death invoked in this dream, it's like if we're firing maybe some sort of bean-bags or rubber-bullets. I don't feel any pain or fear, more or less it seems like I'm more than confident in my own skill, but as well know, I'm not lucid in my dreams, so this all happens and a transition occurs.

Now the perspective is that of a camera, I'm seeing a cop in a police station carrying a box of really good lookin donuts (transparent plastic top on the box, can see sprinkled donuts, munchkins, boston creams) he enters a room and he sets the box down, next to another box of donuts, he says, ""You guys already got some?"" and a cop sitting at the table tells him, ""The more the merrier!"" he has an accent like he's from the deep south. 

The cops start eating and talking, they talk about this group of hitmen practicing at an abandoned school they almost busted, however details get really vague here. I believe another change occurred, cuz I remember seeing Mr. X from Resident Evil 2 and he's chasing the hit-squad from earlier, but the setting of it looks almost tropical. 

&#x200B;

Now here's the weird thing, the place where the hit-squad was practicing looked a lot like Mirage in CSGO, specifically B site, only if it were all indoors and the windows to Apartments were partially blocked off by tall boxes (look up the images of the map and you'll see what I mean.) It was also really dark. 

The police station looked a bit like the station in Twin Peaks, but that might just be the fact that most police stations look similar? I'm not too sure. 

And the final setting seemed a bit like some tropical place. Strangely this dream was just so vague for me, which isn't common, most dreams I have get really vivid. ",new,"Mr. X Chases a deathsquad, cops and lots of donuts (Interpret?)",1.0

He shot her and then shot me and I ended up in the hospital with bandages all over me and then something else happened and I almost fell through a wooden staircase and then our car got towed and I had to track the guy down for help or something and that’s the last I remember of my second dream.

My third dream was I was this Japanese high schooler who lost his big brother and saw a chino version of him everyday and talked to these plastic tiny dolls that came to life, who talk to his brother and he’s haunted by childhood memories with his brother and apparently his family was his dad, mom, sister, sister’s fiancé, and sister’s toddler brother or nephew whatever, and it was a weird family and then he went around burning houses because of salmonella contamination in them???

Me and my ex broke up soon after NYE, at the time it was because I couldn't handle the mental and emotional stress that she put in me 24/7.

It wasn't until I found out that she cheated that I started having dreams about her, im guessing it's because I think I need some kind of closure or something, I am very upset about it but I'm not an emotional person at all, I usually keep everything held back in fear of everybody judging me for having emotion.

I was enrolled into a veterinary college. It looked more like a very large hotel. There was a lecture downstairs in a small classroom. Lots of my old friends were there, and they were all huddling into groups and I was left out. I tried to stay in the lesson but I eventually left and went for a walk outside.

Suddenly it was night time and there was a party back at one of the houses. Everyone started chanting at me to have sex with one of the men there who was still a virgin. I said no, but everyone started striping me naked anyway and forced us to have sex in front of everyone. It was horrific. As soon as it was over I ran away. I found a young girl in the corridor who told me she was going to leave to commit suicide, and had found some of the euthanasia medication in the veterinary hospital.

So, we planned our escape. I ran upstairs to my room to send my mum, dad and sisters a goodbye and ‘I’m sorry’ message.

Then, an alarm went off in the building. They’d realised the medication was missing and everyone was hunting for me and this little girl. It was a sort of stealth mission to leave the building. We snuck about and eventually found a window that we could just about drop from. We ran and ran to a waiting car to take us to a location where we could kill ourselves. I saw my sisters screaming and chasing the car in the background, pleading me to return.

Shortly after I get in bed, she’s breathing fast, crying a bit, and murmuring words, all while she’s asleep. I figure she’s having a nightmare and I try to wake her up but I can’t. She eventually stops. 

A little whole after that, she sits up straight and looks around, but her eyes are closed. Then her eyes open and she keeps talking about ‘it’ and how it’s gonna come back for her. It already cut out her stomach and she can’t escape a second time. She looks at the coats hanging on the door and says, “there it is you need to run.” I try to comfort her and she falls back asleep. 

Then she sits up again and sits at the edge of the bed. Her eyes are actually open and she’s speaking normally, albeit a little tired. She says she’s going home because it’s gonna come get her again. I get her to come back to bed and try to have her use her phone to try and wake her back up fully. She’s on Instagram and starts typing that it’s coming back for her and then she falls back asleep.

Just ten minutes ago she woke back up and starts playing with my face. She seems normal this time. She’s talking energetically, her eyes are wide open, she’s laughing, etc. Then I try and check if she really is fully awake. I ask her, “what year is it?” And she responds “2017.” I say, “it’s 2019,” and she gives me this really dead creepy stare, then looks towards the coats hanging on the door and says, “it says you’re lying.” After that I just didn’t ask anymore questions. I just let her do whatever she wants because I’m scared to ask right now. I’ll wait until the morning to ask about wtf is going on.

I just awoke from an extremely vivid dream where I went to a friend's apartment to commiserate about men-- for some reason in this dream I was attracted to men. I believe she was my manager who bullies me but younger, though in the dream she was young, before her first daughter and we were friends. 

We were complaining about men and then we went to her car at night to get something and she asked me if I predicted her death. I told her I had and it was soon, bit that I wouldn't tell her the exact date. A man came by and stabbed her and I began to scream and cry. He was going to walk away and heard me, and returned, smashing a bottle he was carrying to stab me with as he left the knife in my friend/manager. I was crying and yelling about how in trying to prevent my friends death I inadvertantly caused my own. He stabbed me repeatedly in the stomach and I could FEEL IT. He then poured whickey onto my face and then for some reason he held open my eyes and poured more. 

I like felt myself begin to die-- like I was fading away, I knew I was dying-- and then woke up on a cold sweat. It's one my my most vivid dreams in a very long time.

Then at 11pm the bomb went off and the dream started over again and it kept doing this a few times until my dream self realized that i needed to save myself along with the small family. the father had a big tree in the shape of a small house big enough for everyone and it was completely surrounded by steel but he called it his meditation room. And i guess out of respect i built the smaller room for the family instead. Ended up asking the father if we could use his meditation room for the shelter and he happily obliged.

I'm always on my way to talk to a guy I know (in real life) and I'm always barefoot. When I meet him, we sit outside and talk. I always sit cross-legged. There's either a child mentioned, or a child present, but not old enough to walk. Sometimes he sits in front of me and other times he sits on my left - but we're always close and some part of us is touching. I don't remember exactly what we talk about but I feel safe and happy. The weather is sunny, like it's just turned summer and everything is in full bloom and the heat is noticeable but not uncomfortable. 
This time he had a very young child sitting on his lap as we spoke. She had strawberry blonde hair and pretty blue eyes. She had on a yellow dress. He and I were both dressed in tanks and shorts - though he looked like he just worked out.
 He handed the child to me at one point and she sat nicely with me, but I said, ""I think she likes you best."" He laughed and picked the child up from my lap and placed her in front of us. Then he leaned over to me rather quickly, like he'd made a sudden decision, and kissed me. 
He said something along the lines of proving he was a capable man to me, and wanting me to see him as more than a friend. He intended to join some kind of military branch to show he was responsible.

When I was around 4 or 5 I had a ridiculously realistic dream:

I woke to a light streaming into my bedroom which wasn't uncommon because my mom thought that keeping the stove light on in the kitchen prevented robberies, but it was brighter than normal. I walked into the bathroom, took a pee, and cautiously made my way down the staris to find my mother's boyfriend standing in front of the microwave, motionless, just staring at the appliance. The stairs creaked and he turns slowly.

T- ""Why are you up?""

M- ""I don't feel well...""

T- ""And? What do you want me to do about it?""

M- ""Can I have some medicine?""

T- ""How about some water?""

He pours me water from the tap and I sip on it in silence, after some time I still feel unwell.

M- ""I still feel bad, can I have some medicine?""

T- ""I just might have something to make you feel better..""

He puts his hands on my shoulders and I feel something wet on my shoulder, I turn around and he's been turned into a rabid wolf, the wetness was his drool. 

I woke up with a start, notice the stove light, urinate, go downstairs, ask for medicine, I even drank out of the same damn plastic cup, the only difference was that the wetness wasn't on my shoulder, it coated my lips and the flavour of his c*ck stuck with me until I eventually told my grandfather.

I passed out super fast and I almost felt like I started dreaming before I was even all the way asleep. The dream started off super normal and I honestly don't remember much about the beginning. But the thing that made this dream so weird was the fact that after a while I new I was dreaming. I kept trying to wake myself up,  but every time I would manage to ""wake up"" I would still be in a dream. It also seemed like everytime I found out I was dreaming, the people in my dreams would get mad and aggressive toward me. In one part of the dream in particular I was sitting at a bar with my friend just having a good time and then I randomly got this uneasy feeling that something wasn't right. I looked at my friend and told her I kinda feel like I'm in a dream. She got super mad at me and asked why I would say something like that. At that point I was 100% certain I was dreaming. So I decided to test my theory by seeing if I could fly. I just sorta thought about floating and sure enough I slowly floated up to the ceiling. 

Before I could reach the ceiling though I was grabbed by the ankles and dragged down by a shadowy figure. The figure then jumped on top of me and held my arms down. I tried my best to break free or wake myself up. This is when the sleep paralysis came in. I actually woke up, or at least I think at this point, but I couldn't move. It was terrifying,  it felt like the figure was still on top of me.  I was eventually was able to get out of it only to find myself in another dream. It seemed like everytime I would realize I was dreaming. Something would come attack me and hold me down. This cycle repeated about 10 or 12 times all with completely different scenarios. I wanted to wake up for real so desperately that at one point I thought maybe if I called my dad in my dream I could somehow talk to him in real life and tell him to come wake me up for real. As soon as I called him he started getting angry and telling me I'm not in a dream and I need to calm down. Immediately after I hung up the phone he came in my room.  Morphed into some kind of crazy monster and attacked me. It was so fucked up and I'm still shook by it.


 The last dream phase though was sooo much worse. I was at a family party hanging out with my younger cousins watching TV or something. When all of a sudden I realized I was in a dream still. This time I kept quiet about it because I knew if I let them know I would get jumped. My youngest cousin,  maybe 8 years old or so came up to me and gave me a plate of food. There was nothing on the plate I could actually eat because I'm on a low carb diet in real life. When I told her thanks but no thanks she jumped on top of me and started trying to force feed me the food. Her eyes rolled back into her head and she let out a crazy deep demonic roar that shook me to my core. Then she started biting flesh off of my arm. Like literally taking clean chunks out of my forearms.i could feel all of the pain from her bites. They felt like they were burning my arms all the way past my shoulders into my chest. I grabbed her by the neck and twisted her head backwards in an attempt to kill her. She paused for a second then her head snapped back into place. Her eyes went from all white to a fiery blue and her face morphed into something crazy. At this point I was was crying and screaming telling her to just let me wake up. She then screamed ""never"" In her crazy demonic voice and I finally woke up for real. 


I felt like I was asleep for days,  but when I checked my phone I realized I had only been asleep for 45 minutes. I can still feel faint pain in my right forearm and I haven't quite convinced myself that I'm really awake. By far the most fucked up dream I've ever had.

I have these all the time.  I wake up and try to get out of bed, but my vision is blurry and I can't move my body well.  I start to crawl/drag myself across the floor, and I start screaming for my boyfriend.  Sometimes the screams make noise, sometimes it's the typical nightmare no noise scream.

I almost never ""find"" my boyfriend during these, but last night I did. He's scared and asking me what's wrong and acting just like himself, only I'm backing away from him. I'm scared of him,  because I know it's a dream and that's not really my boyfriend. I'm still just screaming /trying to scream for him and wake myself. 

I even tried throwing myself down the stairs thinking that would wake me up. 

When I finally wake up for real I'm too terrified to move for a while. I just lay there and look around, supicious of EVERYTHING. I'm drenched in sweat and a terrified shell of a woman,  but after a minute or so I realize I'm finally actually awake.

Happened last night. I was dreaming about a zombie apocalypse and I got eaten by some zombie chick. So like I don't really remember the feeling of being eaten (thank god) but I do remember dying and the feeling of transfering from this life to the afterlife.

I can't say it's the feeling of dying but I can say I've never felt anything like this before. It was like I was slowly seeping out of my body and it just got cold. I was in a pitch black area; no floor, no roof or walls, just darkness. I remember seeing some hands in front of me. They were like grey and then they pulled me out and I was reincarnated back into the zombie situation but the apocalypse was over.

It's not even what I'd expect when dying but I was super comfortable with it. It's just the whole pitch black area, I don't even think that's what the afterlife is but that's what i'm afraid of.. it being just a pitch black area.",new,"Had a dream about dying, but didn't wake up right before and instead lived through the experience",4.0

Context: up until I(21f) was five years old my “Uncle Bubba”(39M) molested and sexually assaulted me. I was placed in foster care for this and other various reasons, and he has been in prison since then. He gets out in May 2020. I do not have any contact with my biological family, but my sister does. She called me hysterically crying last week saying that he asked my biological aunt where I lived, where I went to college, and my future plans. She told him everything including the school and location of the grad program I applied to. 


For the (before the above conversations happened) last few weeks I have been having reoccurring nightmares of my “Uncle” stalking me, killing me, molesting me further, and holding me as a prisoner. They occur in various places- sometimes he will chase me through an empty parking deck to my car. Sometimes I will see him and myself through an omnipresent eye and I can see him watching me in an unfamiliar apartment (I seem to live there in my dream). Sometimes he kills me, always by home invasion. In some dreams he molests me(in my child form), but again I see this from an omnipresent view. In my latest dreams, he kills my boyfriend and then takes me as a prisoner. 

I am going to start seeing a counselor for these dreams, but I have been through counseling before for the situation- I no longer have any thoughts about the molestation or anything that happened to me before, now it’s all him. I am terrified that he is going to come for me when he gets out of prison and he is going to hurt (or worse) the people I love to get to me. I have sought legal advice and there is nothing I can do until he does something to me. Please someone help me 

Edit: I am adding for further context: I think it’s important to note that I have had very vivid dreams of life events (family member death, breakups of friends, job promotions, college acceptances, job interviews, and car accidents) before that have come true in a near exact scene from my dreams. This is adding to my fear of him and the situation because I don’t know if my dream is “seeing the future” until it happens. ",new,Reoccurring nightmares (sexual assault trigger warning),1.0
0.0,apacjx,2.0,12.0,"Hello Reddit dreamers. 

I'm a Psychology of Mental Health Masters student and I've used my dreams a lot as a guide to my therapy. My therapist and I started using them in the traditional way (Jungian), but I found a different method started to produce more concrete and actionable interpretations. 

I've now written a paper explaining this method. 

**Title:** A Suggestion for a New Interpretation of Dreams: Dreaming Is the Inverse of Anxious Mind-Wandering

**Abstract:** 
Mind-wandering is associated with the simultaneous activation of a network of different brain regions known formally as the default mode network. Forward looking anxious mind-wandering (or worry) occurs when activity in this network is coupled with a biological fear response in the brain. The fear response constrains the con-tent of anxious mind-wandering, with imagined catastrophised scenarios pushing the mind-wanderer towards avoidant behaviours. There is an established relationship between dreaming and mind-wandering. During rapid eye moment (REM) sleep, where dreams most commonly occur, many of the brain regions within the default mode network are activated. This paper presents a novel argument that during REM sleep the brain is in a bio-logically relaxed state, and that this state acts as a constraint to the content of dreams, which in turn presents a possible function of dreaming. In direct contrast to anxious mind-wandering, dreams present imagined situations which demand confrontational, or un-avoidant, behaviours. Though the situations in dreams call for un-avoidant behaviour, dreamers act with avoidance. This difference between the in-dream behaviour (avoidant) and the behaviour the in-dream situation demands (un-avoidant) highlights an anxiety present in the dreamer which can then be used to direct the focus of therapeutic treatment. Fourteen examples of dreams are presented, including seven examples of interpretation, three examples of successful dream content prediction (a first for an interpretive theory of dreams), and four examples of dreams which demonstrate how in-dream behaviour changes during successful therapy, three of which are my own. Dreams focusing on anxieties developed during infancy as well as in adult moments of trauma (such as post-traumatic stress disorder) are discussed, with a focus on the former.

I'll do my best to do it justice, but I'm positive there were events before and after this that would give it a lot more depth. Anyways, here it goes. Here I am on an alien planet, not horribly strange, but definitely foreign. Not earth. I am on the top floor and then roof of a large grey stone or metallic building. I have gotten to the point where I am the leader of what felt like a large Crew, but later seems to not exist. On tee top floor, my group and I are confronting an opposing group. Not yet hostile, but rivalesque and stern. They have a definite leader, who lacks any distinguishable characteristics. An obvious leader, but I couldn't tell him apart from the rest of his group. We end up on a balcony, facing a drop that would kill even the strongest of men. I am being held up by the enemy's leader over the edge, and my crew has disappeared completely. There may have been something between these two events but I do not believe so, or at least I don't remember it. It appears to be a dream time jump. So here I am, on the brink of death. I manage to turn the tables on him, and I straight up levitate to the point where we've switched positions. We float in a counter clockwise circular motion, I going down to touch my feet once more on the floor, and he to be dangling over the edge, my hands being the only thing stopping him from plummeting.  Time seems to have stopped while this is happening. None of his men do anything to prevent this power shift, merely watching, frozen. This could have happened so quickly they had no time to, in a flash like speed, and I merely witnessed it in slow motion. Because if it was anything it was slow. But I believe time had just stopped. Their leader put up no fight, and later events would lead me to believe I have no super speed. And then I let go, and before he had even hit the ground, I turned to run. His men were once again frozen, this time not because time had stopped, but because they were in shock, speechless. They soon recovered, and as the membrane between the top floor and the roof blurred, and I found myself on a flat and definitely metallic roof, with rounded edges, they chased me. I sprinted to the opposite side of the roof, with knowledge that this other side would have a less lethal fall. I leap off the roof, confident in my decision, and land on a football shaped bush, that although I recall it to be flat, must have had enough cushion to stop my death. At this point I break into a dead sprint. Every muscle in my body working at its hardest. I run away and to the left of the building, at a diagonal. Grass turns to fields, and after a couple 100 some yards, I jump over a small mound, maybe 3 feet in height, possibly a fallen trunk with vins and grad growing overtop it. I see an opening in the vines, on the side opposite to the building and the oncoming horde, and burrow myself in it. I know the group is only seconds away, and I decide to bet all my marbles on staying hidden here, aware that if this didn't work I would lose it all. I crawl in and under, inching my body parallel to the trunk in a matter of less than 4 seconds. I await the stampede that is my enemies, and have exactly two of them step on me while chasing after a man that was no longer running. And just like in all the cartoons, they run right past me, and even over me, leaving me behind. I lie there for quite a while, and am aware of the forum calling the hunt off after some time, returning to their mysterious gray fortress. And then I stay there, for years and years. I fear showing my face. Surviving on what felt like nothing but I have memory of scraps. And then I somehow know that the group had left the planet, as have every other inhabitant of the planet. Not because of some nuclear holocaust, or Great War, but something less tangible, that I am still unsure of. It is at this point that I emerge from the hole that has been my home for so long, anticipating muscular atrophy, yet having perfectly capable muscles. The one thing I'm truly sure of is that I was genuinely alone. Not only friendless, but the single inhabitant of the entire planet. I start my trek back I the fortress I once fled from. Not running, but walking. A comfortable, thoughtful pace. I then find a shapeless space ship to take me away, to events I can no longer recall, but I know were great.",new,Space Under the Grass,4.0

0.0,ap7bml,1.0,3.0,"A few nights ago I had a dream where I kept blacking out, then coming to in the same body, but with a different name, different accent, and different age.

Usually I can tell when I'm dreaming, but this dream was so much more detailed than my normal dreams, so much so that I didn't know I was dreaming until I woke up. Also, I don't know if this makes the dream weirder or not, but with all of these, my dream self assumed I was being reincarnated because I could still remember who I was before (meaning in real life), but the dream felt so real that I didn't question why I was travelling through time with every reincarnation.

First I was back in fifth grade (in hindsight, this actually makes sense, as I had been looking through my fifth grade yearbook that morning to double-check the spelling of someone's name). As I said, I didn't realise I was dreaming, but I thought I had been reincarnated, as a Russian girl (newly moved to the United States) named ""Anastasia"" (again, makes sense in hindsight, I'd fallen asleep listening to the ""Anastasia"" soundtrack). The other students were taunting me for my accent, so I ran outside crying, which is where I had my first blackout.

I came to as Frenchwoman in Paris in the 1830s (my favourite book is ""Les Misérables"", so maybe that's why). This reincarnation was short-lived, as I was soon hanged for my ""sexual deviancy"" (I'm a full-time lesbian). I don't know if lesbians were hanged in Paris in the 1830s, but since when do dreams make sense? Right as I was dropped with the noose round my neck, I blacked out again.

My third reincarnation was a Scottish tavern wench in what seemed like Elizabethan/Shakespearean times (last summer my parents travelled to Scotland, and earlier that day I had been listening to the ""Something Rotten"" soundtrack, so maybe that's where all this came from). I don't remember much from this part of the dream, other than trying to break up a pub brawl, and blacking out right as I was accidentally stabbed.

The fourth reincarnation was in England, in a weird mixture of the Victorian, Edwardian, and Regency eras. I was a high society lady, but I was wearing trousers (scandalous, I know) and a mask. I was also riding a horse and robbing carriages in the dark, so I'm pretty sure I was only a high society lady by day, and a highwayman (highwaywoman?) by night. A police officer shot me right as there was terrifyingly loud thunder in real life, and I woke up for real.

I've never had such a vivid dream before, so it was pretty unsettling. I've also never died or had near-death experiences in dreams. But maybe this dream wasn't more vivid than my usual dreams, and I'm just remembering it more vividly because of how disturbing it was for me.",new,first time experiencing dream death,3.0

It started out with me, my two sisters and a friend in like  some old fashion 70’s convertible Cadillac driving around town. Then we decided to go to a bar that was on the second floor of a building... when we entered the bar, my dream changed completely... Walking through the door of the bar turned to me walking into a bookstore. My high school professor and classmates were in this book store. It was like a field trip or whatever. The owner of the bookstore was some kinds of genie witch. And I remember her moving from point A to point B in seconds. Not teleporting but just floating. I don’t remember talking to her but I remember having this fear for her and try to not do anything stupid like stealing a book because she would know... anyways... so I remember the class gathering around this table and looking through a big book filled with tons of information from everything and one of the pages had a fetus picture and information of it... then the genie/witch ask why one of my classmates didn’t come on this trip, and my HS best friend replied that she was pregnant and I was like, how come I didn’t know about this, yet the whole class knew... the class mate that was pregnant is gay so it wasn’t impossible but uncommon because she didn’t like boys at all. Anyways, after a couple minutes  we we’re about to leave this bookstore but through a back door, and leaving that back door, my dream changed again ...I was now in the middle nowhere. I looked back to the door I had just came out of and it was nothing but mountains and rocks and I was all alone now. My dream ended shortly and I woke up questioning if my old classmate was pregnant, and I went and ask my HS friend of this information and he said no, but she does have a daughter and I was shocked. I questioned myself if this dream was real, did it meant something more or nothing at all but just a dream... but this dream had always been in the back of my mind and hoping to know if someone had any similar dreams or can maybe explain why this dream seemed so important to me.

So here is how my dream went....

My brother, mom and I were in a house doing our own thing. He was playing games and our mom was doing laundry and such. I was just walking around the house...? Now my mom in the dream was not in real physical appearance to my mom in real life. She was hot as fuck....but I felt like she was my mom so I didn't have extreme weird feelings towards her. I just recognized like ""Man....this lady is fucking hot but she's my mom right?""

&#x200B;

She decides to take a shower with the door open and when done... stepped out and started drying off and I kept awkwardly walking back and forth past the bathroom glancing...at her ass and such when I went to hang out with my bro in his room which was nearby lol. So we start playing some console game (can't remember what kind) and the doorbell rings....

&#x200B;

Apparently, I am to tutor some senior high school girl. For some reason I am to tutor her in my brothers room in which case he leaves....my mom turns on some music while she folds clothes or whatever lol. The girl and I enter his room and close the door. We start talking about her assignments and such but then start talking about life...I felt like I was at the age I am now...with almost a decade on her. I started making her laugh...she made me laugh...a real good time. Strange enough we start flirting with each other...now let me say this now...

&#x200B;

This high school girl/woman looked like she could of been in college. Her face and body, personality....everything about her was fucking ideal to me. In real life I would probably change my life for the better if I could have her... So in the midst of flirting I remembered I'm supposed to be tutoring this girl so I told her to hold on while I get some papers from my room. I go to my room and while picking up the papers...started thinking about working out again...getting a good job...getting my own place all sorts of shit. I quite literally thought that I wanted to be some sort of man to take care of a wife and kids. It was odd as fuck since that is NOTHING like me in real life. Wife...Kids...Everything, Shit even A Girlfriend Is Nowhere On My Fucking Radar....hasn't been in over 12 years.

&#x200B;

So...I come back to the room and we try to continue talking about the assignments but it's hard? I can't focus and neither can she it seems? The sexual tension for some reason was heavy as fuck. Then I said something like ""We're not going to be able to focus right now huh? We might as well just fuck...and do this afterwards.""...the high school girl was like...so into the fucking idea. She was so excited and asked me if she could use my shower. I Then thought ""What the fuck am I doing? I'm going to fuck this girl I'm supposed to tutor while my mom and brother are in the house?"" I leave the room while she's in the shower to go talk to my mom. I tell her whats up...but she already knew. She said she sent my brother outside a while ago and turned the music on so she couldn't hear what was going on while she watched a show on t.v.

She then told me that I better not have feelings towards the girl...I lied and told her I was just going to have a bit of fun.

&#x200B;

I go back to my brothers room and wait. She enters the room a few minutes later and closes the door. Standing there in her panties and this little white shirt...I was hit with almost a frenzy feeling. This girl was so fucking delicious looking I almost felt like my sanity switch was about to be flipped off. FROM TOP TO BOTTOM PURE FUCKING PERFECTION. Then I was quite literally thinking in the dream ""OMG I want this chick to come here a second time but If I have full blown sex with her...she might not come back! Fuck!"" So I decided upon oral...without me even saying anything she got on the bed on all fours...she was so fucking happy/excited/sexy looking...even her fucking voice holy shit...thinking about it while typing this is wild. So I get on the bed behind her and slide her panties down...and I think I started drooling LMAO! I told her ""I'm going to eat out your ass and pussy...and how about next time...we fuck like animals?"" She agreed!...I placed my hands on that plump...soft and smooth ass...and spread her cheeks and...I started eating this chicks ass out (I feel like I should of started with the pussy but her asshole was just so damn alluring..) and she started moaning and FUUUUUUCCCKKKK!!!! I lost my mind and BAM! I fucking woke up...with my tongue sticking out licking my pillow LMAO!

&#x200B;

When I woke up I was begging to jump back into the dream and finish...sometimes I can drift back into a dream but not today...not now...not when I REALLY WANT TO.

Sorry if this was too detailed but I typed this out exactly as to what I was thinking, feeling emotionally/physically....and doing.

I started to freak out, but then said I must still be half asleep and if it continues after I've woken up then I can freak out. So I get up, get dressed, brush my teeth and grab something to eat real fast. Then I'm walking down a long path to my university with two friends. It's cold out and we're all bundled in our coats. We're just talking about random things, but something felt wrong. This was my morning walk, but something wasn't right. Then slightly after passing a lamp post I stop dead in my tracks. Holy F... I'm still asleep. One of them looks at me and says what. I'm still asleep! I focuse really hard and I wake up in my bed! 

I'm freaking out, what the heck was that? Am I awake now? I feel awake, mentally I feel like I'm absolutely awake, but I did last time too! So I check around my room. Yup same pink flower string around my wall, just like my room has always been. Then I checked the clock because I had read you can't read clocks in dreams. Yup it's functioning fine, 10:30, a time that makes sense since before all this I had woken up at 8 then gone back to sleep. I begin to calm down then in panic I try to find my phone, and it's there. I can see it just fine. So I pick it up and bring it to my face to have something to calm me down till I'm fully awake. Then right as it gets inbetween my eyes. it. Freaking. Disappears. It does this multiple times. I freak the f out. Holy sh** am I actually asleep. I close my eyes, focus real hard just like before, and each time I do so I just end up opening my eyes in the same position and not ""awake"". I honestly can't tell if I'm awake and am full on panicking. So I yell out my parents names and my mom comes in and I'm sobbing telling her that I can't tell if I'm awake. That I keep waking up, going through my entire morning, realizing it's a dream, and repeating. She's trying to comfort me.

Then I wake up. This time it's for real, I just immediately know it. There's no questioning, no having to check reality. I just know I'm awake now. I look around my room and I'm like wtf. You know those pink flowers I was so convinced proved I was in reality? I've never owned something like that. My room has never been pink like in the dream, it's always been blue with twinkle lights. But I had been so convinced... Also my daily morning walk to the university never happens. While there is a location similar that I sometimes walk to, my university is small, I never have to go outside to get to classes. 

It really took my a while to get over it, and I was afraid to go to sleep that night in case something similar happened. It just freaked me out that it could be that realistic, get more realistic between each ""wake up"", and have details that were totally made up that I was so convinced were real. Really made me question reality a little. ",new,The dream that made me afraid to sleep,2.0

This is a repost because the original one didnt get much attention and i need help.

&#x200B;

So to understand better this dream im gonna provide some backstory. I am 14 and I am a boy. I recently got my head cracked(keep in mind that i got the crack on my fourhead) and got stiched by a cute woman doctor. After she removed my stiches i miss her(i think i kinda got a crush on her) and i kinda miss the hospital. Now lets get to the dream itself.

I got to the hospital to get a checkup. I was invited in a room, and only i was allowed to enter, my grandma couldnt (i was with her when i got my band aid changed and when i got my stiches out in real life). There i saw her, the doctor, lying in bed with her spine out of her body. I asked why she was like that and said she got a problem. Another doctor said to me to sit on a bed with the back at him. He put a local anesthesia on my neck and started cutting my flesh. I asked what hes doing and he replied ""Dont you want her to be fine?"". I said ""Yes, but how aboout my neck?"". After that he managed to remove some bones and put them into her spine. After that they said that there was something more to remove. I begged them to not do it and they stopped. Then they told me that i would be fine for about 6 years. Then i would die. Then i ran from them and managed to escape. I would then go to some dinning hall to tell my parents to go to some groceries. At that point i havent told them about the surgery, i only told my grandma about it. After that I would get on top of a table and started shouting about my experience. The doctor was right next to me and tried to stop me. Someone gave me a pistol and i shot the doctor many many times. Everybody agreed with me and wanted to sue them. After that, i remembered my parents were at the grocceries so i got to them. I found out that they died from a police car that was driven into the shop. They were crushed by the car. The werent got to the hospital and i could still see their corpses full with blood. It was gruesome. I then woke up feeling like the dream was so real that i had to touch my neck to be sure

This dream is short when i tell it, but i felt like 2 days passed out in the dream.

&#x200B;

Something like 200 people. For 5 different sessions. I have to wear a full suit and tie even.

&#x200B;

I told my friend Ashley, who says I constantly annoy her as a ""know-it-all"" that I was a bit nervous about it. We always tease each other. She said ""whatever you do, don't overthink it. You wouldn't want to have that dream where you're doing the presentation NAKED! Hahaha"". I scoffed at how ridiculous that was. But I admit I did blush a bit.

&#x200B;

The next night, I dreamed I was giving the presentation. Everyone sounded impressed. Everything I was saying was on the money. Then, when I got to my key point, I heard snickering in the crowd.

&#x200B;

The snickering turned into slight laughter. Then that grew into loud, uproarious laughter.

&#x200B;

I felt air conditioning on my bare butt-cheeks.

&#x200B;

I looked down and I was naked. But even worse, not even ""naked"". I was wearing nothing but a red tie and tube socks. You know the ones? The high white socks with red white and blue rings around the top? The same type I was laughed at in the 7th grade locker room for wearing while changing.

&#x200B;

My tie hanging over my bare, lily-white belly (not fat, but a rounded belly from snacking too much and never hitting the gym).

&#x200B;

Everyone starts snapping cell phone pics as I desperately cover my penis and turn my plump white ""bubble butt"" towards the crowd and try to get out of the room, which is of course locked.

&#x200B;

As my back is turned to the crowd and I desperately pound on the door begging to be let out, Mmy boss, Ms. Silvan, gets up and says ""Next time I should hire a speaker who's dressed to impress!"" and SPANKS my naked ass as I woke up panting in cold sweats.

&#x200B;

I know it's ridiculous, but the dream felt SO freaking real. I cringe when I think of that feeling of the air conditioning on my bare tush. I blush when I imagine looking down at my bare body. And the looks on the laughing faces of everyone in the crowd (especially Courtney in Finance ugh).

&#x200B;

Thanks to Ashley I now have this dream every freaking night for the last 2 weeks. And it never stops feeling real!

&#x200B;

Ashley said ""oh this is too good. I can't stop mentally stripping you down to your cute little tube socks. Sweet dreams!""

&#x200B;

I understand the meaning of the dream itself, but:

&#x200B;

1. Why do you think Ashley finds it so amusing and hilarious?

 I had to be 15 or 16 years old.... I was going through alot of trauma at tbis time in my life from my first real boyfriend cheating and breaking my heart to struggling with my insecurities and past emotional problems on top of normal high school crap.
  I used to think it was just the result of an active mind and imagination. Now that I am very familiar and somewhat obsessed with anything having to do with the paranormal as well as ghost hunting, things along those lines and have read tons of strange things about dreams on reddit and other sites I thought I might share this dream with others and get their take on it....as it still baffles me to this day.
I remeber feeling vividly as If I was awake in my room but still feeling like I was dreaming. It was the strangest feeling....the entire room turned into a Forrest of extremely large oak trees from what it looked like...the kind that are very old and have extremely large winding limbs.... suddenly one of the limbs  was right in front of me and I remeber being able to see and feel the wind blowing the leaves and even the glistening of each leaf with each gust of wind....I remember there was a rope hanging like a noose and on the end of the rope a Skeleton who seemed to be somehow alive and moving hanging from this rope that was attached to the gusty tree in front of me. I remeber not being able to look away and the more intense and frightened I became caused the skeleton to start laughing more and more at me. It started raising its arm and pointing at me as it started to uncontrollably laugh and cackle at me...I remeber trying to open my eyes hoping it would make the dream stop or look away but I couldnt do neither. It was as if they were already open....this lasted forever in my mind like a repeating scene over and over again but in reality was probably insanely quick...all of a sudden I found myself truly awake , my mother was sitting up in her bed and I was standing next to her in her room , she was consoling me and telling me to wake up. 
For some reason I had gone into her room during the dream...she quickly consoled me and said 'wake up your having a nightmare'

I had a really cool dream last night. It all started with a traffic jam at night on the high way as a family of 4, me, my mom, a brother, and a sister all go to the grocery store as it starts to rain. The 1 clerk working there appologises for the weather and we continue shopping, by the time we're done its raining too hard to the point where we dont wanna leave the store, we decide it would be best to camp out in the store, the clerk agrees and lets us. The rain continues to still pick up and it appears like the end of the world. The whole beginning is important because there was little to nothing unrealistic so I was pulled in freaking the fuck out. This is where things start to turn. We turn on a radio to hear a warning system warning us about a type of flood. My mom then says something about how if the rain isnt evenly dispursed it could create a tsunami of flood water. I didnt see the tsunami but it is highly implied in my dream that the only survivors are my brother, sister, and the store clerk.

When I had woke I realized that all of my belongings were in a pile and a woman was next to me explaining to me that I had just died and I was able to bring one item with me to keep me occupied for the rest of eternity. After searching in the pile for a while I noticed another figure sitting in a chair that wasn’t there a moment ago. I looked into the figures face and saw it was my mother crying in the chair we kept in the living room, she was grieving over my death (I’m only 20). In that moment I felt ever feeling that a mother feels when they learn that one of their children has died. The flood of emotions was so intense that I couldn’t stop crying, I tried to hug her and tell her I was there in front of her, but nothing was alerting her to me being there. Feeling my connection to the last moments on that plane of existence my mother turned to me and hugged me. She told me that she was gonna miss me so much and that she loved me. I was able to tell her that I was going to miss her so much too and that I loved her more than anything at that moment and after I had said that I woke up.

pff i just woke up from a dream

  
basically made up my own anime where

  
if something horrible happens to someone else and they die or are clearly dying, there's a chance that the devil will allow you to enter a mirror world to trade your life for theirs

  
and more often than not, it's really shit cases like a baby dying on absolutely loving parents

  
to save their baby, *both* parents, if chosen by the devil, not only have to prove that their kid's life would be worth saving (despite knowing damn well they can only hope they'd go on to do something positive and noteworthy and have no way to prove anything) but also have to tear their own lives apart in order to deem yourself unworthy of living (but it doesn't count if you're faking your urge to do bad deeds... like, you literally need to become someone who wants to be a burden to the world). suicide doesn't count towards your judgement and simply means now one less person who had any chance of doing so can save the child.

  
and in my dream, it did happen to a baby and the parents were sent back and forth between the mirror world because they go from being loving, childhood sweethearts who longed for a baby for decades to absolutely torturing eachother (one parent to the other in each mirror world, not abusive at the same time)

  
the devil found their desperation and journey into becoming painfully twisted and evil so hilarious that he trapped them in this eternity of alternating between destroying eachother in the hopes that it'll bring their child back when the devil won't allow them an even slightly happy ending. there's no way both parents could live and get their baby. if they get their baby, the baby's taken away from the parent for obvious reasons by child protective services and the other parent dies because of their torture and abuse.",new,"extremely graphic and odd dream (warning: child death, abuse, religion?

Ok so it started with this dream, I was in my parents home, my father who recently passed away was there and my mother. I wanted or was helping out to look after my dad as he was ill but I was sitting with my mother.

My BF seems frustrated with me not doing something he wanted and so, in front of my mother proceeds to wrap his hands around my neck and start to squeeze. I'm telling him to get off and my mother is watching in shock. He stops but does it again, squeezing harder and I know he is in a fit of rage and trying to kill me.

I (and I think my mother helps) get him away and he skulks off. At some stage I'm with him enraged at what he did, I think he tries suggest he didn't mean it but I tell him I felt the pressure I know what he was trying to do....

This kind of then bleeds into another dream or scenario. It's like I'm in some kind of auditorium and I have any pets dogs and the BF is there too. There are zombies outside, hoards of them. It's like we or I have to try and stop them?

So I feel focused on protecting the dogs 

Anyway, the BF opens a door and my favourite of the dogs goes out with him, think he goes out to try and do something to keep the zombies at bay? He's back in quickly but leaves the dog outside.

I'm asking what the hell is wrong with him and he's just saying she's fine but I can kind of see her through the door and she's panicking so I open the door enough to let her in but a male zombie gets in too.

He doesn't look like a zombie from a movie. Anyway the BF is mad at me and refuses to help me try and get the zombie back out and as a result a couple more end up getting in.

I'm holding them all at the door trying my best with all my strength and telling him to help me but he won't.

I grab something and stab the first zombie through the eye, trying to get at the brain. She flops down and I'm faced with the next one, it flops down and then I'm faced with the original male one that got in but it's like he's not scary, trying to tell me something but i do the same stab thing anyway.

Regardless of all this suddenly a swarm of zombies are through and make their way to a hotel or building or something that has people in it outside the auditorium (I don't see this place but I'm aware it's the set up)

I have the sense the BF is maybe mad about this / blaming me.

Next thing all the zombies end up piling into where I am and taking seats with the regular people joining them.

So it's like they are all in the back, like a cinema, the normal people are sitting in front of them, then there is an aisle then another batch of seats and that's where I am but now a girl from work is with me.

A zombie woman my age, possibly one of the ones I had stabbed is in front of me but other than this my side of the room is fairly empty. She grabs my arm to tell me something but I pull away saying she can't touch me and it'd be the same as me not wanting someone with the flu to touch me, like I don't want to offend her or make her mad at me.

She's trying to explain why they are there and is talking about an Arrow or something. Something clicks with me because I think I'm reading about some hotel and I realise she's talking about the name of a golf course and it's part of some hotel up the north and it turns out this is like some nazi place and I start laughing because me and the work colleague were going to hold an event there or something but now we know it's essentially where the devil is telling these zombies to go .....

I'm telling the woman zombie where they need to go and realising they don't plan on hurting us but ultimately know out can't be good what they're up to.

Next thing I know there is gun fire and I look up and the normal folk have opened fire on all the zombies they had sit behind them....

And that's all I remember.

""So first we were at Walmart just looking around at stuff and you kept telling me to stop spending money but I was like ""I need this tho"", and it was things like scrunchies and a lip gloss making kit and some shoes, but eventually was like ya you right. But i did end up getting a book called ""words that are the same word"", Like ones spelt backwards like tacocat. The book was pink and had princesses on it. Anyways, we're walking through a warehouse part of walmart with charcoal bags everywhere, which is also where the tweezers and hair clips were, and we were goofing around and you flipped on a bike and a worker yells at you and you show them how to do it and then it's all chill. We also got a pair of Aristocat tweezers. So we went to go check out, but instead of self checkout machines they had lottery machines. So we went to one and started playin lottery and this guy runs up and goes ""that's my machine!! I left for 2 seconds and you took my machine!!"" And were like woah man chill. So cops get called And the cop is like "" well you left, So?"" And the guy was like ""I mean I guess...I was going to show her how to play it"" and I go ""OH OKAY, YOU WERE GOING YO SHOW ME? LIKE BECAUSE IM A WOMAN IDK HOW TO PLAY IT?"" lmaooo. So anyways he leaves and we get stuck on the game. So it involved some metal balls and numbers. But we couldn't figure it out so we dumped all the metal balls down a drain out of frustration and water starts bubbling up everywhere and were like ""good, maybe it'll flood the city"" so we run home so we don't get caught, and we had just moved into this house that we lived in previously, but we moved back because it was a nice house and they got rid of the bed bug (no that was not a typo. We kept saying ""the bed bug""). I tried convincing you to help unload the uhaul but you were like ""no I wanna watch the newscast on the flooding"" so we turn on the news and it's super sad cause the city is flooding and there's hippos and elephants dying and on the tv a zebra on a bike grew wings and tried flying away from it and you go ""that's not going to work, Luigi already tried it!!"" And I look outside and someone I went to school with, their parents were walking up the driveway and I was like ""why are they calmly walking to our house during this flood??""

0.0,ap24ig,1.0,1.0,"Hello. So tonight i dreamed about people trying to confuse me. To be completely honest i can feel myself doing similar this but this is a bit over the top (in the sence that, there was kind of no point to it). What happened was: I talked to a bunch of different people I know and they kept trying to pursuade me in to different, unrelated ideas. I have been threatened by a knife, they threw tomatos at me, i peed all over my clothes for some reason, managed to party for a while, then was blamed for taking someones feet (didnt quite make out the meaning of that yet). Im starting to think Im not as good (meaning that I do a lot of wrong as i think I am getting this guilt trip for a reason) as i thought i was. It does seem like a lot of the events of my life have been leading up to this and i have probably wronged some people. I wonder what I actualy am and what caused me to develop such negative emotions for others. I think my family blames me for killing my dad (had no physical contact with him for atleast a day before he died, so maybe i had some mental affect on him that caused him get hit by a train). Im not even sure about that at this point. Well who ever tried to confuse me they did a pretty good job. Id just like to know one thing. I assume that people helped me by dragging my body over the years and I just was an asshole to everyone. So to celebrate the peoples victory over my torture (sounds ironic, but I actualy do not mean it to be as I am trying to change and make up for it) I wilingly refuse to participate in society and hope that i get what i deserve. I am some what relieved that I finaly realised what i have been doing wrong and will try to make the best of what i have left of my life. So in order to do that i need your opinions on this (only honest thoughts are appreciated since this kind of is a life or death thing). I can not promise i wont do anything that i used to do or still do, but i promise now that i realise what a peace of crap I am. Looking forward to some feedback if possible. Thank you for reading.

I stayed for hours with her talking about the paranormal and occult, and it got very late. She invited me to stay the night, and let me pick out the room I wanted to sleep in. I found a room that seemed to be decorated for me, in just my tastes and favorite color scheme and all. I said that out loud to her and she smiled and nodded. She told me what room she'd be in that night, as Sarah was known to not sleep in the same room 2 nights in a row, and then she left. I stayed in the room I picked for a while, and tried to settle in, but felt very uneasy and kept hearing odd noises. The room seemed less and less inviting and eventually I couldn't take it anymore and went to find Sarah. She was sitting up in bed still and I asked if it would be ok if I slept in her bed with her. She smiled and nodded and I settled in again and this time felt more comfortable, easily falling asleep in my dream. I had a dream within my dream where I awoke to the dark house with no one else there but me. No Sarah, no maid or butler. I wandered the halls alone and calling out. Then I saw a man with a rifle at the end of the hall. He aimed right for me and I began to run. As I ran I morphed and changed into a Native American girl and the house faded into woods. I kept running and looked behind me just as the man fired his gun. I fell and then the ground beneath me turned back into Sarah's bed. She said she'd watched me having a nightmare, and knowing I was a medium, she asked me what it was about. I told her and she nodded, knowingly. I asked her how she could stay in the house, it was so overwhelming and she'd have more peace if she left. At that moment she appeared not as a young woman in her 20's, but slowly aged into a old woman.

She’s saying stuff like “He just got outside get out here now I have eyes on him.” I whip out a flip phone, and I called the girl that lead me outside and told her what was happening. I’m not sure if she gave me much advice, but I took off towards these houses across the street. I had super fast movement as I grabbed on to things and launched off them. I was mainly using my arms to move as I floated though the air at high speeds. I took lefts and rights to lose whoever was chasing me. I was so deep into this residential area I figured I would go back a little bit and see if anything’s going on. I go into this big long building with lots of antiques in it and I hear people coming. I hide under a table in the middle of the isle as people dressed in all black with long boots clomp by me on either sides. There was quite a few of them, and one even brushed up against me.

I stop and tell her everything that happened. I love her so much and I could really feel it. I told her I went really deep into the houses, and she referred to them as the “Flatlands”. It seemed right. Then she told me about how the people that were searching for me used to be called “Satans’ Angels”, but they’ve lost their ability to fly so they aren’t really called that anymore. Their sole job is to hunt down people like me- people that can fly. I finish up talking with her, and I run into Zayne. He’s asking me how I fly, soI teach him a little bit. I show him how to use the energy from your body to float off the ground and intensify it. He actually gets it a bit and does some little tricks in the air before he lands.

So let's start. I was looking for a series on Netflix and was very tired and fell asleep I did not notice, that I fell asleep.

*I was on my laptop on the world wide web and felt very tired. I remembered that I wanted to learn how to control a dream and thought, that it was a good Idea to make a note on the laptop in case I use the laptop in my dream. I made a note on the laptop where I wrote: ""You are dreaming."" I thought that it can't go wrong and I am happy, that maybe when I go to sleep, I am going to control my dream. So I closed the laptop and went to sleep.*

**I was at home and looking TV in my bedroom. Before I was going to sleep I wanted to clean up my room from the mess I made, cause I was eating some popcorn and was drinking some energy drinks. So I started cleaning up my room and accidentally spilled the energy drink on my carpet. I touched the carpet cause I wasn't sure if it was full or empty. I touched the ground but it wasn't wet. It was like I had mayonnaise in the drink. It felt like I spilled some ketchup on the floor. I ran to the kitchen and remembered by myself that when u look at your phone while dreaming u can determine if you are dreaming or not cause the phone doesn't work in dreams. so I looked on my phone and it freaked out and it was not useable. I was very happy because I can now control my dream. I started flying and screamed that I am the king of the city now. I somehow fucked up and woke up in a sleep paralysis.**

*I could not move. I was hearing my heartbeat increase and it was very loud. I started to freak out and realized that I am in a sleep paralysis and started to calmly breathe in and out. So I freed up myself from a sleep paralysis. Then I said fuck it I am going to sleep. I closed my eyes and again. Somehow I woke up with a friend in the room. We were talking and having fun to play video games. I remember to hold on my breath to check if it is real or not. I did the reality check and I was dreaming again. I felt like a king and was screaming that I am the king. Somehow I fucked up again and woke up.*

Unable to move. Started hearing weird shit and some laughing in the background. I thought that I am going to die. But I freed up myself finally from the paralysis and realized that I had dreamed some weird shit. Stood up, sat on my bed on the side and started to think about it and thought to myself, what sick shit is in my head going on.

&#x200B;

This is one of the many dreams I have. I dream many times that I go to sleep while I am dreaming. I don't know what does this mean? Maybe I have such a lack of sleep that I need to sleep while dreaming to compensate the hours I didn't go to sleep because I needed to learn for exams and so on.

// Can anybody explain to me how to properly contain the power of the dream. Cause whenever I have the chance to control the dream I fuck up and end up in a sleep paralysis.

I dare not write the dream down but I'll mention this - I saw a man and a little girl on the other side of an invisible plane. I could not hear them on the other side of the plane but I could clearly lipread what the man was saying to me.

To give context to this situation, I have been asking myself certain questions and meditate to find peace and relevant answers.

All I can think of is that girl is somehow very unlucky like I can feel she has the capacity or power I cant explain. The dream went by with us enjoying the place but then felt very unlucky. Like a misfortune suddenly is around the bay or something. This leads us to have a meeting and sort of remembered we only had 1 fortune. We have an item which I understand is a game. It was a small box with rectangular cork-like printed drawings. Not sure how or what logic but it was like you can only play it once and the drawings were not there when we buy it. It was like, it appeared during the game and the drawings turned out to be very high value. Also, there was another child, not sure of gender but all of us felt it can kill anyone literally. So in short, there are 2 kids, the misfortune-bearer girl and the killer child. And then this happened, there was a huge earthquake and I'm the only survivor in our family. I was lucky since when the quake happened, I was by the door and when the cottage crumbled, i could still breath. I woke up with my coworkers finding me in the rubbles, not sure why they got there. All I know when I woke was my family are gone but not because of the quake, but because of the killer child. But we didnt find there bodies, my coworkers were looking for them very deep but what we found were those cats. Those cats were now big that all the kittens I was referring were females and now have a lot of kittens each. Mind blown, the dream happened for a day but those kittens already had kittens. I was observing them being nursed by their moms when they suddenly mixed up. Like they were organized a minute ago since they drink from their mother then the next they were like gathering in one place. And then I went looking for the fortune box, the game of corks. I found it by the hand of the misfortune girl sitting beside the killer kid and all I heard was the voice of my mom saying in my ear it now has no value because the girl did something. I didnt know what or if she destroyed it but I was furious. Also, I think I observed the girl cant talk. My coworkers watched me angrily bit those corks and having a battlecry-like of screams. It was I think because I knew the girl wont even understand if I will scream some words so I just screamed weird sounds. I bit and chewed those corks and was like spitting it in front of her. I might have showed my dominance? And that was the moment I was schocked. The girl was histerical and I know she understand what I want her to feel. She looked very traumatized like she was making sounds and like having a short-stop-movements I understood as mental breakdown. The killer child was just looking at us. And then I woke up. I felt my heart was heavy, I didnt woke in panic or fear but I know Im calm but weirded. What could it mean specially those kittens that turned to bacome mother cats in a day? Why do I felt I know those kids were not bringing us good stuff? Any advice? All will be appreciated :) Thank you for reading",new,Not pleasant,2.0

I am aware that there are a ton of people I know, and I'm supposed to be involved in this event or location in some way and this is the most vivid part: I know that a lot of people are there expecting me to come outside/downstairs to be a part of the activities and for no discernible reason I'm terrified of doing so. I run through the building, taking dark hallways and staircases as fast as I can trying to lose the people. They aren't chasing me menacingly, nobody even knows where I am. They're just casually looking around for me. They only want to find me so that I can be social or whatever. There's no reason for me to be so terrified of being found but it's the most important feeling in the world.

0.0,aowooq,1.0,1.0,"Ok, so im gonna start by saying one thing. im 22, havent had a real nightmare since i was 16, and ive had 4 in the last week, 3 of which have been the past 2 days. if it were one or two id probably write it off as a one off thing call that the end of it. but 4 seems like it might mean something. ill post a detailed description of each, below, as for some reason i can vividly remember all of them.

the first one was probably 4 or 5 days ago. in the dream it was around 2-3 am and my mom told me to go to the store to get some stuff for her to cook, i walked out the front door and looked across the street and saw this unnaturally large guy just dragging my neighbor from his house. and by unnatural i mean like 10-15 feet tall and probably a good 6 feet from shoulder to shoulder. i noped out of there and went inside, somehow already knowing that it was coming for me next, would try to get in by mimicking my cat who is frequently outside, needed me to open the door, and also that its name was bojack. i told my mom very calmly that something would try to get us to open the door and told her to not open it under any circumstances. she said ok. and i sat at the stairs to guard the door. about a minute later i started hearing cat noises and clawing and i put up with it for about an hour, then i got pissed and banged on the door and just screamed ""fuck off bojack"". that ended up being a mistake as it ended up being that it only needed me to make contact with the door to open it. a second later the door busted open and bojack grabbed me by the ankle and started pulling, i managed to hang on and asked mom why she wouldnt help. she turned and with the calmest look on her face feigned a smile and just said ""you didnt ask in time"". then i woke up.

the second one would have been thursday night. i was a vampire, and i was part of a pack of about 6 or 7 others, one of the others had eaten to many people and got noticed, so we met on a frozen lake in the swamp to deal with him. we ended up burning him then left. i was traveling with one other vampire when the earth opened up and he fell into what i can only describe as a giant mossy beehive. i guess in the dream world he was my best friend cause i jumped in after him to try to help. next thing i know im being picked up by this MASSIVE snake lady, thing like the size of the death star or some shit. her tongue had another smaller version of herself on it who told me it wasnt my turn yet and through me out of her den. i knew immediately that it was going to go after my clan, so i ran like 80 mph toward our main hideout, all the while these scarecrow like things jumped out of dilapidated houses and exploded at close proximity to me, eventually i got hurt and had to drink my own blood to keep going, after doing that any time i moved at full speed this weird sand thing kept getting closer to me, looked like if robin hood was made of sand. eventually i made it to them and then the snake lady attacked with my friend and the vamp we burned both being ""assimilated"" to be like her minions. then the dream did the weirdest thing ive ever experienced. it switched to what i can only describe as some kind of news broadcast where a reporter was talking about some weird psychological breakdown that resulted in 5 deaths, all the bodies of my clan were pulled from the house, including my own, except the 2 who the snake lady assimilated. then i woke up.

the 3rd and 4th both happened last night.

the 3rd started with me being at a family reunion of some kind, i was talking with a cousin who doesnt exist in real life, when out of the corner of our eyes we both see this 8 or so foot tall thing moving from tree to tree, in a red cloak, we both knew it was gonna get us, so we gathered everyone and ran inside. after a second or two the door exploded and i just woke up.

i went back to sleep and the 4th started. this time i was at an outdoor restaurant with my mom and my sister, when i had and unignorable urge to go up a hill and dig. i did and i found a coffin roughly the size of, what i can say now, bojack. i didnt realize this at the time because i didnt remember that dream in the dream. so i opened it for some stupid reason and this dude that looked like solomon grundy from dc comics got out and chased me with an ax like the one hulk had at the start of thor ragnarok. somehow i managed to go back to before i opened the coffin in a similar fashion to reloading a save in a video game, but it didnt matter, it gave me time to get in my car and leave, but grundy-bojack was able to keep pace with the car no matter how fast i went. then i ""reloaded"" again to a point before i even dug the hole and we just left. then i woke up.

ive always had strange dreams but this many nightmares in close proximity after such a long time of none has me a bit concerned. the only parallel between all four that i can thing of is the thing after me is always insanely large. any ideas what these could mean?

0.0,aowgz9,6.0,2.0,"For as long as I can remember, I've had nightmares. The theme it's always the same: I get chased (hunted down might be a more appropriate term, but whatever), I get caught, tortured and eventually killed. 

Sometimes I see who's hunting me, sometimes I don't. Sometimes it's just one person, sometimes hundreds. Sometimes humans, sometimes not. Sometimes it takes just a few hours to be over, sometimes the hunt last years. But it's always the same, I eventually get caught and tortured. And I feel every. Second. Of. It. I often wake up in pain, and during the dream it's excruciating. 

I always have full control over myself in the dream, and 90% of the time I realize that I'm not in the real world, but I can't manipulate the dream at my will, nor can I wake up. I can just move freely in this dream world and make my own choices. There's only one way to make it stop: killing myself in the dream. My favorite way it's by falling: relatively quick and easy to do, and death it's almost always guaranteed instantly and painlessly. But I'm not always so lucky to be able to end it this way, and most of the time I have to endure the tortures.

These dreams can also last for very long periods of times. We're talking of years spent in a different world. I go to sleep and wake up in the same dream, and there's no way of telling for how long this will go on. 

I've lived so many lives, met so many people. I've done and seen unimaginable things, I've died so many times and in so many ways. I know what it's like to be stabbed. Shot. Skinned. Torn apart. Burned alive. Drowned. I've had broken bones. I've bled to death. I stared at my own guts. And I remember them all. And I remember the pain.

Sometimes I force myself to stay awake in fear of what's waiting for me in the other world. Sometimes I get drunk just to enjoy a night of dreamless sleep. I've had medical test dome, talked to a therapist, everything. 

But they always come back.

And they always will.

(Obligatory sorry for formatting, am on mobile.)  

This is a dream I had in the car on the way to vacation in Austria. It would be my first time snowboarding in 2 years, so I was excited. We drove during the night, and it was (as the usual road trip) pretty intense driving. This meant lots of vibrations and noise, and this usually does the trick of keeping me aware enough to be somewhat lucid in dreams when we're driving. I can relate this to the summer, where when we went onto a bumpy road, I was dreaming of an earthquake. Anyways, this was a dream I really enjoyed. It was very vivid, and so I'll try to describe it in as much detail as I remember. It was one of the most beautiful and (somehow) insightful dreams I've had. So, basically, I dreamt that we landed on mars (idk if it was actually mars but I had that kinda feeling/hunch of ""I know this is true"" without any context), and we explored a bit. Well, I'll refer to it as ""the planet"" because I am sure it was mars.. but some things didn't add up. Anyways, here it is.  

I remember from just after we (idk how many, probably 20 of us, all my age of 18) exited the rocket. We were wearing space suits but no helmets. It was dark - really dark - and the air was so clear and refreshing, like on a winter's night on a mountain top. I had a flashlight, and I turned it on. The ground was snowy/icy and glittered, and there was no moon nor stars to light up the snow, and so far no clouds either. While I had a flashlight, some people threw flares which lighted up the ground in a bright white magnesium-like glow, while it was also blinking like flares normally do. It was kind of mesmerizing seeing the snow glow up like that. As more and more spots of snow got lighted up by the flares, I spotted a small pit (1 meter in depth, and probably 4 meters diameter). I called for more flares at my location, and I noticed these weird... Things. They were almost perfect and creamy white cubes, 1 meter tall, wide and deep, with smaller cubes attached. Kind of like an enlarged salt molecule. I examined these cubes with my flashlight, and more people flocked around the site to take notes and discuss.  They were littered all over the site, in all different configurations and variations of sizes - it was almost biological.  

I don't know what exactly we were doing there. It just kind of started like this.  

Anyways, I left the site to explore more, and I came to a small hill. I looked back to the rocket/whatever space vehicle we arrived in. I was about 50 or so meters away, and when I looked back over the hill, I saw clouds and a little brighter sky, like very early sunrise. I was so excited. It went over the expectations of the landing. I shouted over to the group that there were clouds, and then the dream turns kinda fuzzy.  

Then, the dream jumped to being back in some kind of base or mother ship (with a feeling of being bummed of not being at the snowy site). Perhaps I got teleported back or something.  

Someone (specialist in something, female) was supposed to arrive there too but she was 30 days late because of a miscalculation. We would be there for 60 days, so she would have half the time to examine it. Apparently we had found something of interest on the planet, and that meant that this specialist was supposed to examine it. I don't remember much about her other than she was also my age, but I have the feeling it's someone I know. I just don't know who.  

And then, I sadly got awoken. I was so engaged in this dream, and am sad to not be able to continue it in my dreams. Perhaps a story should be written, but I'm terrible at stories. I'll definitely consider it, however.

I had a dream I was kidnapped with a bunch of other kids. I can’t remember his name but it’s that dude who ate his own shit and his mother. It was a process that mirrored my own abusive relationship trauma recently. I had to play the part that I liked being kidnapped. I finally got to a point where I was able to call the cops and I understood how all the locks worked in the home. For some reason, the police helped the other kids but couldn’t locate me. Also, in my dream, like the mirror to my own waking life, there were many times I was trying to escape but I got caught and I was unable to. It got to a point where they were about to force me to have intercourse with not only him, but that peaches girl from Instagram. That’s where I knew I had to get out or I’d die. Over the time I was kidnapped I learned how the locks worked all over the house. I went to the bathroom to “change” and I escaped. I was hiding in the woods, on the phone with the police once again. They couldn’t find me. I also remember throughout the dream my dog was around. Sort of like a symbol of hope that helped me escape. After this, I woke up in a room with my “mother” and a girl who was apparently my twin sister. My twin was crying and I realized she was the one who went through this, and I just saw it with my own eyes.

I had a very vivid dream last night (closer to the morning and the end of my sleep, actually). I'll tell you what it was.

So I was in my kitchen, when a helicopter spotted me and started shooting at me (think John Cena in ""Bumblebee""). So I ran into my bathroom and locked the door. A high-ranking black belt from my Taekwondo school suddenly appeared and helped me jump down to the ground from the second floor. A distant relative was waiting and helped me escape in a rolling trashcan.

Then I stole a mailman's bike (my mailman doesn't even use a bike) and started pedaling down the street toward's my grandma's house. I started catching a lot of air (like basically flying; think video games) and got into a race with another guy. Then for some reason, the scene switched to a bunch of grassy hills and I see an Irish castle in the distance.

There weren't any Irish people, just a Mexican noble family. They had special traditions that only one person can conduct now, and it was this girl who they took in who was really quiet. We rode away on my bike along with one of the sons of the family to reach China and fight the people shooting me in the helicopter.

Somehow we ended up at Stanford (this was the weirdest part). The last thing I remember was being in a stone bunker before waking up.

The dream started off with a good friend of mine and I pulling up to this diner in the middle of nowhere. We couldn't find our way out so we decided to get some food and think it over. (At this point I hadn't started to lucid dream just along for the ride really) we ate and paid and left. Things started to spiral once we left we couldn't find her car. We searched the parking lot for a while, but something kept telling us that this random vehicle that looks nothing like her car was hers. We decided we would get in and look for her actual one. We drove for a second talking about the car before this kind of clarity took over me and I realized that it was her vehicle we were in and after that the car looked like hers( I most likey changed the car back into the one I'm familiar with) we started seeing strange things and for some reason decided that the woman at the diner had fed us something that was allowing her to change our perception. I was wigging out because crazy things were happening we drove down the road hoping to find a way out and the road in a block form rose us into the sky while we were in the vehicle. A lot happens in between then and the part I'm trying to get to I won't bore you with the details.

I told him a backhanded joke like “oh I bet you’re ready for this concert, it’s gotta be your type of music (Grayscale, Story of the Year) which turns out to be pretty inconsiderate and racist considering, stereotypically, African American culture prefers rap/hip hop over hard rock/punk/alternative. Maybe this man liked the bands. 

Anyway...

Grayscale starts their first set and I guess they had a sound problem. The speakers weren’t working or their equipment was still malfunctioning. They tried to fix it, so there were gaps of silence while they were on stage. I wanted to buy a drink, but subconsciously I was worried about money (definitely related to spending habits lately). On my way to the bar, I noticed my buddy and I were wearing the exact same outfit (peach colored sleeves, gray torso, three button long sleeved shirt, gray sweatpants). I started feeling anxious. My buddy said he’s going to buy souvenirs so we don’t look the same. He comes back with a new outfit. 

To pass the time while the band figured out their equipment issue, my buddy and I played pool in the back. The band figured out the issue, called me out in the back of the room because I was alone not paying attention to them, and invited my buddy on stage to play a set (he shreds on the guitar). My buddy suggested Mr. Brightside, and the place started filling up a little more. I tried taking pictures of him on stage but I couldn’t get a clear shot. I was walking back and forth near the front of the stage, found a random bucket of popcorn and decided to take a handful. It was salty. Didn’t really like it. 

When I got back, the band was off stage and suddenly the room was empty. I get a text from my buddy, “me and grayscale are meeting the guys from story of the year. Come up” I said aw hell yeah, but I had questions. I figured it wasn’t right to bombard my friend with texts considering he was busy, so I went on about looking for them. (Story of the year is alright to me, so I wasn’t crazy about meeting everyone. Still wanted to do it, though.) 

I emerged from the showroom to the lobby and it turned into this giant, overwhelming, old-school kind of grand ballroom. Almost everything was made of wood. The stairways were wood with wood railings. You can smell the sawdust. There was only one person in the lobby and she was working behind a desk. I decided not to ask for directions on where to find my buddy and the band and to know where the location my buddy referred to when he said “come up.” I found a staircase and went up. 

When I got to the top, it was pitch black with several open doorways without doors. I walked into a giant room. With each step, I felt the entrance and only way of escape was moving further and further away from me. I walked around corners in a maze-like layout shouting “hello? Anyone?” Then I found myself in the middle of the room. It was totally empty and pitch black. I fell to the ground in a panic and I could feel the dust on the scratchy wood floor. Things started to get blurry and with every double-take I had, I saw black figures. At least three. Shaking, I reached for my phone to turn on my flashlight. The light was very dim. Dim to the point I could only see about six inches in front of me. Still in a panic, I felt these figures were starting to enclose me, getting closer and closer by the second. 

So, in my head, I convinced myself this experience wasn’t real and told myself to calm down. I closed my eyes, controlled my breathing and things started to go from hazy and dark, to clear and light. It was as if a picture went from totally blurry to totally clear. The room lit up with light. I saw everything perfectly clear and the architecture in the room was gorgeous. Sort of reminded me of mid evil times. I exhaled. 

Then, I looked over my shoulder to my left and a black figure was sprinting at me, came 2 inches from my face and screamed. It’s mouth was distorted and super wide. It was as if I could climb into it and get sucked down a never ending black hole. Teeth were spacious and pointy, but not very long. The figure had eye black on his cheeks. His scream was more like a dinosaur shriek - a pterodactyl. 

I woke up with my heart beating out of my chest.

I am in a forest, holding a stick, all of a sudden I get pulled of my body and I go up, into one of [these](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8225/8378903123_349a97c80f_b.jpg) (<--- idk how you call these so I just linked a Tera pic lol). After like 2 seconds of traveling really fast in a backward motion, I see a big beautiful white female angel with huge white wings. She stared at me for a while from a medium distance, and then lifted her arm to point at where my phone was located in relation to where my body (in real life) was (get it?). Immediately after she did that my alarm went off.

&#x200B;

Its like my brain was dragging me out of my dream to wake me up, at the exact moment the alarm was going to go off (10:40 AM).

&#x200B;

I turned off the alarm and closed my eyes again, just to realize what the hell just happened. A fucking big white angel FROM A DREAM dragged me out and pointed at where my fuckin phone was at the EXACT time the alarm was going to go off.

People were performing and everything and friends from school were their. The one i remember most vividly was Jade. She was hanging out with these theater kids from my school and she feel asleep. There was then a break and the friend group decided to go backstage. So they used a blue portal to teleport their. I followed them through the portal and saw like a dressing room with a tiger-stripped jacket and some other random jackets. I was trying to find the group but didn't see them anywhere. The break was over and I heard them say ""Guys lets go back"". They took a portal back to the America's got Talent place. I finally met up with them in the top seats. I don't remember what happens then but all I remember is some cyborg looking figure being alerted of my presence. I then pull out my phone and go on Snapchat and try to talk to my friends through there about what just happened. They don't answer or see my text so I decide to man up and go through a portal to go see them. As i'm going to enter the portal the cyborg guy gets a hold of me, pushes me on the floor and slits my throat. I wake up again in the dream back to the beginning and it then cuts to the cyborg perspective of the story. Its shown he was controlling my Snapchat the whole time and he was watching me. And every time I try to alert my friends of his presence he somehow kills me. It shows me multiple times like in a loop that I die in horrible ways. I died from a propeller fan in one instance. But every time I die from the cyborg I wake up in the beginning where I was in the America's got talent place. I finally wake up for real this time and had trouble moving. Took me a few minutes to finally get out of bed. I feel like this absurd dream had a message to it. The message could be how I just wanna fit in or fear of missing out or It could mean that I have a crush on Jade but every time I try to make a move I'm stopped by the cyborg guy which could be a metaphor for some obstacle in my path.

For about the last year or so I've been having a similar recurring dream with a guy that I used to talk to. I haven't spoken to or seen him in about seven months and the dreams are still happening. 

In the dream the setting is always different but main theme is always the same. He always walks up to me and hands me something. Just randomly will hand me different items. In one dream he handed me a rock that turned into a snail and in a more recent dream he handed me a paper bag that had cookies inside it. (Honestly I'm skeptical about this last one having any meaning.) 

To add some context (if it's even important) we weren't exactly dating but we had been out and where very friendly with each other. There was flirting and what seemed like the start of a potential relationship. Then one day it all just stopped. Suddenly. 

I don't know if there is any meaning to any of this or if maybe I'm just thinking to much into it. But if someone has some insight I would love to hear it. ",new,Recurring dream about someone giving me things.,4.0

The Tweedy farm had essentially been flattened into an enormous gravelly field under a permanently night sky. Mr and Mrs Tweedy were acting unusually co-operative and had made a pact with a strange wine-themed demon, which had the consequence of transforming both of them into unliving abominations covered in black tar.

If I remember correctly, Mrs Tweedy and the wine demon started bonding and having this strangely intimate love affair that Mr Tweedy wasn't aware of, as I started witnessing flashes of them both sharing moments in the countryside and in extremely high-class rooms with velvet curtains.

I believe the three of them were planning a revenge assault on the chickens that had escaped to the countryside in the first movie. They spent a moderate length of time discussing their attack strategy in the midnight gravel field, and the dream ended with the three diabolical individuals approaching the comparatively sunny countryside where the chickens were residing.

I woke up before the chickens even noticed them approaching, though, and I've never returned to the dream. It's such a shame, I would love to see the rest of this movie, part of me has always wanted the chickens' peace to be horribly disturbed.",new,Dream about the sequel to Chicken Run,3.0

At that moment, my friend(not really close) was also in that country but she had financial problems too. She told me where I could find a suitable atm to withdraw money. I was overwhealmed with anxiety in that dream as I was not sure if my atm card had been activated for overseas usage. I was queuing for the atm and out of a sudden, the ground was flooded by a toilet bowl that had choked and the entire ground was dirty. The crowd dispersed and my friend took me around to search for another atm.

It was a horrifying dream! This is the second time that I have dreamt that I was overseas and found myself in a state of being penniless. 

In reality, a few years ago, I was in a very similar situation where I have to sell some of my personal valuable things in order to get some money for basic essentials. That was when I was briefly unemployed.

I was just crying a few moments ago before I started typing this, suddenly I was worried about one day if I become unemployed, and my own savings get used up, and if I have no money to get foods, my elder brother very likely would not help me if he is my only surviving kinship. I suddenly have this overwhealming feeling of helplessness and that my brother wouldn't help me. I even imagined a situation whereby I even have to steal money for food or eat scraps of whatever rubbish foods that is at home. I know it is a very riddiculous dream but I think I know that I have no social support.

I used to have a group of primary school friends that were very close to me. We hanged out a lot and are close like as if we are blood-related. However, things changed terribly, I blocked them out because they were always ignoring me and not being a support whenever I need them. One of the popular girl, she accussed me of something I never say, and she left the whatsapp group chat. Immediately, another girl left, because she is a fawning syncophant. Waited a few more weeks, the last 2 remaining friends also left the group chat. I was heartbroken. After some consideration, I made up my mind, that I msged one of the closest girl friend to explain that since that girl would always be there, and the fact that all the while, i have never been treated fairly in the group. I said that I would leave forever, shortly after, I blocked everyone of their contacts and I never appear again.

I blocked them on facebook and whatsapp. In my heart though, I still cherish the friendship shared but I am also extremely heartbroken by the way they treated me! There were a drawer of letters and some childhood/teenagers photos. I remember their birthdays, their old addresses, and one of the girl mobile number.

The dream starts off with my mom and dad owning a hotel by the ocean in Rhode Island (I live in Illinois but Rhode Island is one of my favorite places and I feel safe there) and I had seemingly been working for them my whole life and my best friend IRL who lives in Texas just moved to Rhode Island to move in with me and work for the hotel. 

My dream wasn't really clear on this part but somehow a giant shark winds up in the indoor pool and some people decided it'd be a good idea to taunt it. One man accidentally fell in and his arm got ripped off but he lived. After that just a huge panic set in and everyone was running around the hotel up and down the floors like the shark was going to walk or something. 

Between the chaos of me trying to calm down visitors and my family I saw this man down the hall from myself and he was helping anybody he could get to safety. And for a moment we locked eyes and it felt like everything around us just stood still in that moment. He was a beautiful man. Very tall, curly ginger hair and bright eyes and excellent bone structure. Then he disappeared.

All of a sudden the shark problem was fixed. My father somehow managed to get the shark out of the pool and back into the ocean and get the man's arm out of the shark to reattach it to the man. Weird. The hotel was back to normal. Then suddenly I had this intense need to find the curly haired ginger man. 

I realized at some point in this dream that he is a part of my IRL friend group so for the purpose of this explanation I'll call him John. IRL I've always found John very attractive but never thought about him in this romantic type of way and I doubt he'd be interested in me. He lives about an hour away so he doesn't hang out with my main circle of friends too often but we've talked a little bit here and there.

In the dream he comes up to me and hugs me so tightly and it was honestly the best hug I've felt in a long time. He is so tall so my head fit perfectly on his chest. Then he asks me if I wanted to go out to eat with the rest of our friends and I of course said yes. We went to one of the best seafood joints in RI and got a big table for everyone and John asked me to sit next to him so I did. He offered to pay for my meal but I'm stubborn/independent so I gratefully declined but he insisted on at least buying an appetizer to split with me and so I agreed. He kept offering me food from his giant plate of food and I took it. It felt as if he was trying to take care of me and make me feel loved with some of his actions.

After dinner he told me that he'd wanted to tell me he has been attracted to me for a long time and that he thinks we should try for a romantic relationship. I told him I think we should start off being friends first and see where it goes from there. He kept telling me I was hard to resist (this moment reminded me of the cheesey moment from the first twilight movie where Edwards telling Bella she's his own personal brand of heroin). It makes me laugh thinking about it now. I can't ever imagine someone telling me I'm their drug. That doesn't happen.

I gave up with that and hid behind the walls And turned into some sort of paper towel using my powers. The villains had some sort of threadlike gun that strung up through your hands.

Somehow I escaped, somehow, some of my friends came too. We finally escaped on an old ship that the OLD me created. Also I found out that my captor was actually me, just a lot older and he was very confused/upset at the villains. But I couldn’t concentrate on that right now. The one who created the ship was another me though. Somehow, i had a flashback of the old me (ship builder one) trying to start the ship. He had been chased by a monster (something that was the mix between a giant Bowser, and the Green Goblin from Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse). Riley, and others escaped on this old ship with me, but Alaina W couldn’t go on since she had crutches. My other friends went on something different. I saw Sadie and others stay back. Our old ship was very broken and non-sturdy. We started it up, and flied through space and time. We saw the worlds from an eagle eye view. The dream had heroic music and everything.

Two nights ago , I had a dream where I was in Australia with her and a bunch of Australian people I have met through her, and we were staying in a large house with lots of windows overlooking a forest. Later on we got in a car and drove through a mountainous terrain where there were lots of gum trees surrounding the winding road. (Sorta like the blue mountains in Australia). 
In the morning I thought it would be interesting to tell her that I had that dream , and she then proceeded to tell me that she had nearly the same dream. 
We just FaceTimed and in her dream I visited Australia , where me and her friends were staying in a mansion with a view of a forest, and then went on a drive through the hills where there were many trees, and during this drive I said I was moving to Australia.

I was in a car, not driving and alone, and the setting was the airport drop-off at phoenix airport, but a bit different— I think  I was at Shanghai. There was really bad traffic, (some cars were perpendicular to me, basically crashed into the car I was in) and I saw some little kids running out the car, onto the sidewalk on the left, so I got out of the car following them, running like the Train to Busan. 

We entered a building, not saying a word, but there we're no people in the building except one— I'll get to that later. During this time, we did not stop running. I don't even know these kids, I'm just following behind. We run through a metal detector, and maybe 20 feet ahead was a walkway, like those things that is almost like an escalator but flat, but my view became third person, almost like a drone’s view. There were a few more walkways about 20 ft apart from each other, but keep in mind, there were three walkways next to each other when we walked through them. The ones we were walking through had a blue strap labeled STAFF in big white letters. We were jumping through all of them. The kids were jumping over them just fine, but I was knocking the straps over. A woman comes out of no where, running in front of us. She’s wearing a business outfit, a blazer with a pencil skirt with a brief case, and we don’t mind her as we run. We finally get to airport security, but it’s not like normal security. There is a desk on the left where a security guard sits and on the right, there are conveyor belts labeled STAFF, GENERAL, and the other one I do not remember. Of course we put our bags through, the woman puts her brief case in the one labeled STAFF, and the kids put their small bags in STAFF too. I put my duffle bag in the same one, and I get teleported to a house. 

There is just a hallway with doors, except the hallway leads to a big room in the middle, leading to another hallway. These hallways are very short and are not ominous, but I enter a room, and it’s supposed to be my room, but it doesn’t look like my present room. Anyways, I sit down, and three big, muscular men that all look the same come into my room wearing security guard uniforms with short sleeves and come state they are going to squish my skull, and I will die. I comply; the one in the middle squishes my skull, but I don’t immediately die. I can feel the blood pooling in my skull, presumably from the brain damage I must have gotten. The men walk out of my room and turn left. I follow them. They walk past the big empty room in the middle of the hallways to the second hallway where they open the door to the left of us. I walk into the room where they’re squishing my boyfriend’s skull. I don’t remember seeing my parents’s skulls getting squished, but dream me knows that they did. They are in the room in front of mine. I sit with my boyfriend, saying my “I love you’s,” and we just sit there, hugging each other and crying that we love each other, and that we will miss each other. In this state, I’m in no pain, just experiencing the warmth in my skull that is the blood pooling in my brain as I wait for my inevitable death. I start getting lightheaded, and my view goes black.

Also, it's not often I have dreams as vague as this, it's quite short and it almost jumped me, like it tried to jump me awake but I just woke up normally. 

So this dream starts with me and my dad using our tablets (Note, he has one, I don't. The one I have in my hands looks like a thick glass sheet with a screen that has no transparency) 

On our tablets we play Magic The Gathering, it looks like the traditional way to play the game, not the new styles and whatnot, which is weird because the MTG Apps are played with different game modes, additions, and new stuff all the time. 

We're outside and a bus comes, so we get on it, sit in the back, still playing MTG on our tablets. We get to the bridge of our town, clouds have rolled in and so I looked out the window, the river was much much higher than normal, there were huge waves. Like I mean enormous!! 

After a little bit, of just sitting there, I realized we never had a driver, but as I'm looking forward, the bus accelerates and is immediately traveling at like ludicrous speed it was crazy. Now what's cool is that the bus didn't take lift off or anything like that, it was grounded to the surface of the bridge (the bridge arks up a bit, part of it's design.) and as we hit the end of the bridge, the bus is moving so fast, I feel as if I want the bus to turn, I want it to move so we can drive down the street going this speed, but directly in front of us is a hill (There are three roads to go on coming off the bridge; left, right, straight, but going straight, the road is tiled to the left side a bit and so, if you just go STRAIGHT off the bridge, you will go right into a bit hill where a little home sits on top of.) The bus just goes right into the hill, before impact I wake up obviously, thing is, I didn't jump awake or feel frightened, as a matter of fact, I woke up casually and went back to sleep, had another dream but I might need some time to try and remember it. Ah fuck it I'll explain a bit of it since it's coming back to me.

I'm in the back seat next to my older bro, I think his friends are up front and to my left, it's crowded from what I remember. I think we're smoking, but what I recognize is the road we're on is of the piece of land across the river, look across and I could see the school and soccer field, to my right, I'd see a church, barn, and motel. Yeah, I know this road, we're driving along and it's just... vague as that. I can't remember much else. Btw I know in this dream that I wasn't any girl, I was definitely me as me, since when it comes down to dreams about family, I tend to not go into any other perspectives, like film camera nor strangers' view points.

I don't remember much about the dream itself, but at what turned out to be the very end, a man said something along the lines of: ""And now we will hear a piece by (can't remember), with two cellos…"" He kept talking for a few words after that but I don't remember what he said. Not a second after he finished, a song began. It was my brother's alarm on his phone.

Now this may sound normal at first, but let me outline a few issues I have with that. First of all, I generally wake up at 6:30, but this was a weekend. My brother had to wake up because he had a concert and we were all going to it, but I didn't have to wake up then. I wasn't prepared for this, or expecting it at all. It's rather alarming that the timing was so perfect.

Second, he never sets alarms on his phone. He used to a while ago, but it was this obnoxious song with a woman saying ""good morning"" over and over, and he didn't even have the same phone back then, and it had a completely different set of songs. Guess what instrumental arrangement it had? Exactly. There was a cello playing the melody. I'm not sure if a second one ever comes in, but it's a bit unexpected. I had never heard this song, and was not expecting consciously for it to play.

From what I understand about dreams, they're created and set beforehand by the unconscious part of our mind, what I like to call the unconscious soul. The unconscious soul kinda just pulls some random things out of the deepest depths of hell it can find, and springs it on you. But if I'm to believe this wasn't a coincidence, my unconscious soul would have had to know the following things:

* Exactly what time it was, down to the second.
* When my brother's alarm would be set off, and even the fact that he had set one.
* What the arrangement of the song would be, within a degree of error.

[Abu Simbel](https://i.redd.it/o0892g1xzif21.jpg)

  
A decade ago when I was a Christian Pre-teen, I had a dream. This dream happened while I was struggling with my faith - and while religion is NOT the focus of this post, it needs to be noted due to what my mindset was verses the nature of the dream you are about to read. Also, I had not done any type of drugs, nor had I even had my first sip of alcohol.   


So here we go.  


I was walking barefoot thought the sands of Egypt, when I came upon Abu Simbel. Four huge monuments freshly carved, none damaged. I approached with caution, and they all turned their heads to look in my directions, but they were not looking at me directly, more so beyond me. They stood up, and started to walk in the direction they were staring. I followed for many hours, until we came to a rope hanging from the sky. 

I looked up, but the rope did not have a clear connection point. It just faded into the blue atmosphere. A monument reached for it, pulled, and acid rain fell from the sky destroying it. The second and third did the same. The fourth went to grab, and I screamed out for it to stop, I begged it not to kill itself.

It looked down with a calm expression, an understanding smile to my pleas, and pulled. Acid rain did not fall, but it crumbled into pieces on the ground. I understood in that moment that they were content with death. I wondered alone pondering over what I had seen, knowing for a fact I was dreaming, but unable to wake up, until after endless moments I passed out in the sand.

I didn't wake up... I was just... there. Observing a wormhole with colours streaming along it's walls, liquid and so vibrant as if everything in the woken world had a shade of grey in it. There was a metallic ball the size of a basketball floating in the centre, reflecting the colours, but I couldn't see myself.  There was no beginning in this place, I had always been there and I always would be. 

And so I existed for countless eternities in that moment, the thought of escaping never crossing my mind. Again, nothing changed, I just was. (No feeling of transition) I was in space, with my legs crossed looking out to the stars. I was staring in the direction of where earth should be... where our Solar' system should exist. A giant explosion took place, sucking into itself forming our star with millions of years flashing by in seconds. 

I looked down at my right hand, and my dead skin cells were being manipulated by gravity into a ball in front of me, they converted into something like stem cells and grew into a heart. The heart beat once, and something in my head said ""I am the universe observing itself"". 

A deep rumble, a trembling so menacing from the edge of our universe cast echoing through out the stars, and I watched far... as stars twinkled out and a black mass approached.   


\- That is all -  


It's starting to fade from memory, so I wanted to share it before it goes.

All my friends drove away and I was the last to stay.As I tried to kick-start my bike,a girl came out from nowhere . She looked very weak and sick.She looked like someone of my age. She told me that she needed my help.I told her to get on my bike and asked her where she was from.As she tried to get on,I think she fainted and hit the ground.I quickly helped her up and I made her sit at the front of my bike(Me and her,facing each other and her legs and arms loosely wrapped around me).She was half conscious.As I drove in this manner,I could clearly see her face.She wasn't the most beautiful girl or cute.But she had a face that looked like as if it was touched by the Gods.Atleast to me,it felt that way .I drove for a few moments,confused where to take her.I decided to take her home and let her stay for the night.As I reached home,I carried her to my room.When I was climbing up the stairs,I felt that she was looking at me with those weak,drippy eyes.I laid her down on my bed,and I covered her with blankets to make her warm and cosy.I felt that she was hungry and hurried up to the kitchen to make her some food.I came up with a bowl of hot noodles.She then looked a little stronger and less sick.I told her that I made her food and placed the bowl on the bed.She looked a little shy.She thanked me for what I did for her tonight and looked at me with eyes that screamed love and empathy.I felt lost at that moment.It didn't feel like a dream.It was so real.Then, I woke up.It was so frustrating and at the same time,I felt a blow of breeze,a breeze of love.I wish that one day, I meet her and tell her of my dream and love her like I loved her in my dream.

He was so stressed out at how dreadful his life was and how much work he had to do that he had developed stomach ulcers.  I think at the end of this part of the dream he was about to be retired.

I decided to face my fears by going from the top to the bottom of the hotel in the lift.  Once I was inside, nobody else pressed the button for the lift, so it just kept descending, picking up speed until it seemed it was almost freefalling down.  It was going so fast that I was really scared.

Then I heard a vacuum cleaner in use outside the lift door which didn't go away.  Someone was cleaning the floor right outside the lift and the sound did not disappear as the lift descended.  It made me think that maybe I am not descending after all. But why did it still feel like I was falling fast?

Even though I was a 3rd grader in real life at that time, I dreamt of an older version of myself who was around 12 y/o. I was from an alternate universe where I was apart of a large royal family and living in the capital of a planet called Arcadia. The people/creatures that existed there all had various forms of magical powers and supernatural abilities. One day, an evil witch led the outbreak of a war and in the midst of it all, the ""good"" people opened portals for us to flee from our home. The portals were misty and purple, and I vividly remember entering one as the soldiers of our capital fought off the witch's followers around me. I also remember having been separated from all my friends and family because they were forced into different portals.

The next dream continued exactly where I left off. I fell out of the portal into what seemed like my backyard, except in my dream I knew that I had never seen this yard before and the atmosphere was completely foreign. I heard the sound of cars (there's a street behind my house) and was completely confused at the site of birds and other common animals. I tried to fly out of the backyard and use my powers, but they were gone. No one I knew was around me either.

Over the next couple years, I kept having consecutive dreams in which I was trying to teach myself how to fly and use my powers again. Still, I never recognized people on the streets and I was constantly being chased by humans (I somehow knew I was not human in my dream) who wanted to capture me to perform lab experiments in hopes of finding the source of my powers whenever I used them in public. Eventually, I began running into people from Arcadia who were also in the same boat as I was. They told me there was an underground academy of Arcadian refugees who could teach me how to master my powers on Earth.

A few years pass and I have graduated from the academy-- not only have I learned all my supernatural abilities that I possessed in Arcadia, but I am now a professor there teaching younger refugees. Throughout this time, I have gone on several ""missions"" fighting evil demons (that had been the witch's followers) who had also gone through the portals with me. As a professor however, I now guide younger students on these missions and fight alongside them. All the while, I am learning how to create a portal to return to Arcadia. Even now, after 13 years of having these dreams, I am struggling to return to the universe that I long to return to.

In this dream i am with three close friends and a bunch of strangers, and were climbing a mountain, what I believe to be Mount Kilamanjaro in the dream. We've climbed most of it until there are three ziplines left in order to get to the top. 

The first zipline I fly across with ease, across this icy canyon. It is sunny and beautiful but also icy all around. When I get to the other side I watch as the last stranger gets to our side. There are a bunch of bunnies hopping around innocently to which this last stranger who got to our side, picks up a rock and throws it at a bunny breaking it's neck and seriously injuring it, more or less killing it. Another stranger exclaims 'you bastard! Someone call the police, what an asshole!' Or something along those lines anyway. 

On this side is an office, inside are loads of people at desks etc. I can't remember the details specifically of this part, but I realise we are in Peru (I know Mount Kilamanjaro isn't in Peru but this is just how it worked for some reason) and I discovered this trying to bring justice to the poor bunny that had been horribly attacked so mercilessly.

Anyway, this is the really interesting part. 

We all leave the office and it's night time. We come to the second zipline. It's cold and the wind is blowing ominously so that we can hear it howling in the night. This zipline is suspended above what I can only call an abyss, a blackness with no return. I notice a small wooden sign right at the edge of the drop. It says this:

'37-3'

I ask the strangers what this sign means to which they all scoff and respond 'what do you think?' 

At this point I realise, it has to do with how many people have successfully and unsuccessfully gotten across, though to me it's still unclear as to which way around, though I'm inclined to believe 37 people didn't make it, though in the dream it seemed more like 37 people had gotten to the other side.

Anyway, I realise there is no harness to this zipline to protect me from falling, and I can't even see the other end of where it goes. This is a terrifying environment and I'm filled with anxiety. I debate it for ages as to whether I should get on it, until I'm rushed by one of these strangers (these strangers where all a lot older and where all dicks to be fair) going 'well, are you gonna get on it or what?'

I go to my friends 'i think this is too risky this' to which they all agree and we back away from the strangers who seem to have been here before aand were all filled with relief.

As we make our way down the mountain, the sun comes out, and the greenness really pops out. It's beautiful and me and my friends are happy.

Just for a little context, I'm 18 and me and these same friends are moving to a different city next year to go to University, and I am thrilled about this. I had some anxiety about having not heard back from this uni but they eventually offered me an unconditional two days ago. 

I am also a manic depressive, who has been undergoing a bad depressive episode recently. I have difficulty managing my anger sometimes, and recently have had uncontrollable instant rages which I have felt powerless over and truly ashamed. My mind up until this last day has been toxic and truly unbearable and even suicidal to some aspect. 

I really need help interpreting this, because I feel this can help me or it means something really significant. I don't even think this has to do with the uni, and I think the bunny dying definitely has something to do with my anger, though I wouldn't attack somebody I (I am even humiliated to admit this) broke my laptop when it was taking too long to load the other day and this just added to my feelings of worthlessness and stupidity.

I had a rocky relationship with my mother, who was at best unapproachable and at worst, abusive (verbally and emotionally). Our relationship has evolved since I moved and we are much closer now; I have learned to forgive, but forgetting is hard. 

I have stayed on rare occasions at their place when I go to visit, either by myself or with my husband. It is always when I stay by myself that I dream of shadow figures surrounding me. 

I remember distinctly two instances of this dream:

The first instance was a few days before my wedding; I had stayed with my parents to run some errands for the event and my then fiance had stayed with his parents to finish some preparations. I fell asleep with my back facing the door and my face facing the wall. I woke up in a cold sweat after having dreamt of a shadow figure standing behind me, watching over me and not making a single move or noise. I told my parents of my dream the next day and my mother insisted it was my grandfather coming to visit me to wish me luck on my marriage (my grandfather had been dead for over 3 years by this point). 

The second instance was about 2 years after my wedding; I had gone just to visit and my husband couldn't come with me because at that time we were applying for his residency and he had no passport. The bed this time was positioned with the ""front"" (where my head rests) against the wall and right in the middle of the room. The door again was closed. I woke up screaming for my mom and dad after dreaming of three shadow figures surrounding me: one by my feet and one by each of my sides. They again had been watching me, but this time they were talking. I do not remember what they said, but I was terrified.

I have stayed again at my parents' house after these two instances, but never by myself and always with a light on.

I was riding a bike on narrow streets with abandoned houses that looked a bit like movie-sets. I should rather say I was biking through a movie-set street with abandoned houses, with random rags and clutter everywhere. I kept getting off my bike to look at the houses from afar.  

It was daylight and sunny while I was looking at the houses but the next thing I know it was dark outside and a
man was following me on another bike. Then the setting changed to an old, very dirty house in which I was sitting on a ragged couch and gave a unkept, fat middle aged man some sort of letter to read. He started reaching for his crotch. His wife, also very heavy and unkept, was looking at me with contempt in her eyes. There was an uneasy, sexual tension in the air which made me very uncomfortable. 

On the couch next to me I knew there was the man who followed me earlier and now I knew he was a serial killer who was somehow toying with me by forcing me to ride the bike and him following.  It felt that the dream was starting to reoccur from the beginning.

I woke up feeling very, very unsettled, both scared and uncomfortable, which I still am now, writing this post. I am very sure I have dreamt the exact same thing last month, and the dream
keeps ‘replaying’ 2-3 times until I wake up.

I dont know what to make of it, seeing that I also had another bad dream (sadness-inducing) last night. For about 6 months now I keep having these periods where I try to start working out and sleeping better and 2 weeks in the bad dreams start happening. Then I cant work out anymore due to lack of sleep. And the cycle repeats itself. Help!?

I am having issues getting over a past relationship in RL and I keep having bad dreams either of him, which make me sad, or panic-inducing ones like the above. Work is also really tough because I’m unable to concentrate due to the lack of sleep over what is now a really long period of time. Working out really hard helps a lot and I’m really struggling to get back into it, however I just cannot keep it up for more than 2 weeks at a time, since that’s when the bad dreams start occuring. I work out and sleep well for 2 weeks, I get somewhat rested and then the dreams start happening.

Bingo! Bingo!"" over and over again (the weird sh\*t kids do...)

I was a freshman in high school in 2013/2014, which was 10 years after we moved into the house. One night at the dinner table my dad spoke up and said:

We were inside a 2-3 storey building and went room to room. He flipped objects in the rooms upside-down and stuck those on the ceiling with his gravity defying telekinesis. 

Eventually, we reached a room with nothing but about 20 plastic chairs inside. The man sat down, and I saw him individually pinpoint each chair. It looked to me he thought about how to arrange the chairs in a certain manner to form a certain shape.

Suddenly, I was on my phone chatting someone for help. Then, the man laid back on his chair, light breathing, looked asleep, and now topless. Stared at him for a few seconds and then an unseen force blasted the chairs all over the room but it wasn't the man's doing. 

Froze a bit, shouted ""In Jesus' name!"" Not a believer, but have a habit of doing this in nightmares for good measure lmao.

No reaction from him, so I began to escape room to room. Rooms had multiple doors that led to another smaller empty room, and only one door truly lead to another room that would bring me closer to the exit.

I eventually reach a room with a locked door and a shower cubicle. I peeked underneath the locked door, saw sunlight and ground outside but it was locked. I thought to kick the door open, but  was afraid it would wake up the doctor.

So I grabbed two chairs, put one on top of another and climbed over the cubicle. In it was a shower-stove hybrid. I turned the shower knob that looked like a stove's dial and instead of the showerhead shooting out water, it lit up flames as though the head was a mini stove. 

There's another door in that cubicle that led to a small room with two toilets. Then, I noticed a window with grills, except the grills could be slid to the side, so that the window was wide open for me to climb through!

I do that and saw I'm about 2-3 storeys up. The outside looked like the view from my elementary school's classroom lol. Also, tall walls surrounded the outside of the building. Figured I'd have to climb over it later.

There were 3 to 5 people passing by outside, and when I screamed help, I spoke it in Hindi instead! I am not Indian and don't know Hindi, wtf. Also realized I was naked, but didn't care - had to get out.

I was walking in a forest type area that morphed into the inside of a house. As it was transitioning, I noticed my hands were covered in thumbtacks, then my bare feet were covered too. The person I was with had some in their hands too, but nowhere near as many. She started to pull the few she had out of her hands, and I started to do the same by grabbing handfuls at a time from each arm. They were falling on the carpet and seemed to be multiplying. As I took them out I tried to walk away, but clumsily fell back into the pile of tacks. Now they were all over my legs and backside, and again in my arms and hands too. I think I took them out and fell back in several times. The last time, I noticed I bled just a little bit as I pulled them out of my fingers (but they didn't before then). 

There was no pain, but I could feel the tacks when they punctured skin. It was a weird feeling, but also oddly satisfying. Kind of like slicing thick jello, or if you'd pushed a tack into a sheet of rubber. Removing them was also oddly satisfying since they made little ""popping"" sounds and reminded me of bubble wrap. 

I tried to google some interpretations, but the results weren't written very well (poorly translated English?) so I didn't really put much weight into those.

Last night, I had a dream where my family and I went to New York on vacation. We were on one of those open ferry boats looking at the Statue of Liberty. We were the only people on the boat besides the tour guide. There were huge waves rocking the boat, and I remember having fun at first while we were on the main body of water. It appeared to be coming from barges, but there were lots of other boats crowding the river. Well, when we were done with our tour, we went to go dock the ferry and get off. We entered this small channel and there were two barges creating a ton of waves. The waves kept getting bigger and bigger and I remember watching out the side at how huge the waves were. Up until this point, I was happy; it was a fun dream. There was one huge wave that knocked the boat over and I remember right before the wave hit the side of the boat, I looked at my parents and thought I should tell them I love them. Then the wave hit the boat and flung me from it. While I was in the air, I felt calm. I knew I was about to die, but I knew there was nothing I could do about it, so I let go. I watched as I headed straight towards the waves coming out of a barge and I felt the impact when I hit the water and was sucked under with the current. Then, I remember watching the light fade as I sunk deeper, and then I remember just relaxing and breathing the water in. That’s when everything went black for a couple of seconds. When a picture came back into focus, I’m now outside of my body watching my lifeless body float under the water in the river against the dock wall. Right before I woke up, there was an image of a computer screen making it look like this was a simulation or alternate universe.

0.0,aoibpy,2.0,1.0,"[24F] So I've been having similar recurring dreams the past few nights..

The other night I dreamt I was in a house that I didn't recognize with my 2 older sisters. (It was a simple home with a 'single mom's apartment' kind of feel.) My sisters were looking for something in the bedrooms but I kept watch bc I was terrified that the person might come home. I remember wanting to steal something, idk what but it was nothing of value. I don't know what my sisters were looking for but they didn't find it by the time a woman came home. I warned them and we tried to get out but we were caught. The woman didn't seem surprised we were there. She wasn't angry, she seemed like she wanted to help us. She said she didn't want us to get in trouble and instructed us to go out this little hatch way type door in her kitchen floor. We did as she said and it led us down a dark, damp concrete stairwell. At the bottom was a metal gate that I lifted for my sisters to go under. I held it open while they checked it out bc I had a bad feeling that we'd need to go back. When they went through they realized we were in some sort of underground dungeon, almost like a sewer. We heard the door at the top of the stairs lock like a deadbolt. As I stood there holding up the gate, we all locked eyes and knew we were trapped... then I woke up.

Then last night I dreamt I was in a different stranger's home with my boyfriend. (This home felt different than the home in the other dream. It had a bachelor pad vibe, with minimalistic decor, cathedral ceilings, and a massive kitchen.) We wandered the house for a while, -me looking around and taking in the beautiful design of the house, -and my bf looking for something, shuffling through drawers in the kitchen and muttering things to himself like, ""where is it?!"" I didn't pay him much mind and kept wandering until I found a staircase to the second floor. I started up it, dragging my fingers along the cold wooden banister, imagining living in a beautiful house like this one... when suddenly I heard a car door slam that startled me out of my ""daydream."" I realized we were in someone's house and immediately went into panic mode. I looked out a window and saw that it was a car across the street and my breathing settled, but I was still very aware now that we needed to get out before this guy got home. I kept uncontrollably trying to steal small mementos on our way out.. again, I don't know what I wanted to steal, but I just had that feeling that I needed to take something that nobody would even notice was gone, for my own memory of this place. My bf started rushing me and told me he felt uncomfortable with me taking anything that wasn't what we were specifically there for.. which I have no idea what that was. I put whatever it was back, as I was nervous and kept looking out the window, but my bf didn't find what he looking for and I woke up. 

Some backstory about my real life - first of all, I don't steal things. I have stolen clothing from the mall when I was a stupid teenager, but never in my adult life have I stolen anything from anyone. About 6 months ago I packed up my life on the east coast when my mom passed away and my childhood home went into foreclosure. My boyfriend and I bought a camper, fixed it up, and then headed out on a journey of exploration, stopping in the Carolinas and working to pay for our stay.

We were working together at first, but then about 2 months ago he got a job an hour away from us, so I stopped working so he could take our shared vehicle to work. I was using the time to myself to focus on quitting smoking cigarettes, which was giving me crazy dreams. Then the other day I found out that he had been talking to other girls, sending inappropriate photos, etc.. for the past month or so on Facebook.

Now, he didn't physically cheat on me, but he has done this to me before and the betrayal and my insecurities were insurmountable at that point. I caved and started smoking again. BUT we talked things through and we both said we'd try harder from now on, even though my sisters think i'm nuts for staying with him. (It's not easy to be sexy when you live in a camper.. broke living and 4 minute showers don't allow for much primping.) Since this whole ordeal last week, things have been pretty good. He's brought me flowers and has really been paying attention to me.

TLDR; my mom died 2 years ago, I live in a camper now in a different state with my bf of 3 years who has recently been unfaithful to me, but I stayed to work things out. I quit smoking cigs then started again and now i'm having strange dreams almost every night about breaking into random people's houses.

If anyone has any ideas or suggestions of what these dreams might mean I'd be grateful. I have very vivid dreams all the time and i'm a firm believer that they are my mind's way of trying to tell me things when i'm too close to a problem.

He was older, with short white hair and wide, glassy, blue eyes that had a glint of crazy. He wore a wrinkled, tan-colored trench coat and blue jeans. It made him look as if he had just come inside from a wilderness hike.

He was walking behind me with a hurried pace, but I turned around and stopped him. Our eyes met, and I said ""What are you doing?""

""What's it matter to you?"" he replied, very disgruntled. ""I'm no one.""

*Shadow figure*

It started with this shadowy figure killing everyone I had ever met in gruesome ways except when they were about to die i'd witness it through their eyes and it would always be different each time except for the end. It would be me and my friend Alex and I'd be crying and panicking and he'd make me hide and i'd watch as he was killed before it would look at me and I'd awaken literally sobbing. The dream happened every night for a month, eventually I'd catch glimpses of the thing out the corner of my eye or when i'd look out the window beside my bed. I'd never be able to look it in the face but I remember the burning red of its eyes. The last night i had the dream everything happened the same except i didn't wake up, instead I was in a glowing forest on a bus with my friend Maggie, we got off the bus even though the driver told us not to and as soon as we turned to get back on it was gone and the feeling of something coming settled in so we booked it through the trees. Right before it grabbed us we came into a clearing and everyone from my dream was standing in it, staring at the sky transfixed. I glanced to Maggie and she was staring too...When I asked if she was ok i got no response and when i went to look into the sky my dad woke me up for school. I still see the figure though.

*25 year dream*

In this dream i literally went through 25 years of another persons life yet it was my own. I had all of my senses, ate food, went to school, had a job, and a whole different family. The world was also dystopian kind of? When I was around 15 in the dream i realized it was all just a dream and tried to jump off my parents roof to wake myself up and only broke my legs and arm, felt every bit of it too, my parents were pissed. I also remember a guy in the dream who always looked confused too, he's important for the next dream i had which is one that fucked me up a lot.

*Stairs*

I awoke in a white room around the size of a football field, completely naked, and surrounded by other naked people who were slowly awaking and looking around frantically confused. I remember it smelled like a dr's office with an underlying scent of death. I asked the closest person to me what was going on and they just shrugged and told me they were dreaming and just wanted to wake up, ok weird but i brushed it off. Then the voice came over the loudspeaker and told us we had successfully finished phase 3 and were moving to phase 6, that we'd be given a choice to either choose the stairwell leading up or down, both lead out. But if we didn't move fast enough doors would start closing us in and we'd have to deal with the hive to continue on. Then this part of the floor opened up and a table filled with backpacks came up and everyone rushed for them. Inside were a pair of army pants, a long sleeve shirt, a Glock 23 Gen4 ,40 pistol (I dont know how i even knew what the gun was in the dream. but I just did. When i woke up i looked it up and it was an exact match, also I'm not in the military at all.) and a box full of ammo. I put the clothes on and loaded the pistol before rushing for the stairs leading down, people are screaming and shoving to get past each other when the man from the 25 year dream grabbed my shoulders and spun me around, crying and screaming at me. ""ITS YOU, YOU WERE IN MY OTHER DREAM, WHY CAN'T I WAKE UP WHEN I TRY TO, ARE YOU DREAMING TOO?"" And then I woke up. In my night terrors i've never been able to wake myself up no matter what i do.

Overall this has really effected me. In another dream i died over 50 times and didn't wake up each time, felt myself dying each time but couldn't wake myself. When I woke up I had extreme stomach pains and was diagnosed with CVS (clinical vomiting syndrom), as well as IBS. I'd never had stomach problems before the dying dream though (I was stabbed in the stomach a LOT in that dream) also there was a symbol that kept reappearing in all the dreams, it looked like a double sided pitch fork, sometimes it would be tattoos on someone, other times an earring.

I somehow befriended him and started to talking to him, all happening in a kind of blur. I can remember knowing about all the people he killed, he had killed about 15 girls that night, I also somehow went on the run with him, we were talking at a train station or something, then we went around the corner where he had a car paint shop, he had his regular car there and then next to it an old school Mini Cooper that he had just finished painting with regular house paint, it was still dripping wet, the paint was also just slapped on like he didn’t even try, I got it all over my clothes and shoes, I can remember being very confused on why we were taking this car and not his normal car.. he didn’t give me a reason for it. We drove back around the corner to the train station where I thought we were getting snacks for the road or something, but we just sat there in the car for like 5 minutes. I then remembered I didn’t have any clothes or sentimental items from my house with me, I asked him if we could go to my house to collect these things but he said no; I argued I needed to go back for a while but I just left it. For some reason in this dream, in my head, I remember my brother buying a new house, but it wasn’t a house, it was an old hall with 3 inches of dust across the floor, I could also remember trying to clean the dust multiple times for some reason. Anyway, we got onto the road driving, Frankie said to me not to worry about clothes because he will take me shopping at Giuseppi, I said; what about a watch, will you buy me a watch, he agreed. After driving for a while I remembered, in my dream brain finding a list or something showing the people he had killed, I saw a girl on there that I quite liked a lot, loved even. When asking about the girl he just said ‘don’t ask questions to something you don’t want to know’, I left it there. I also asked why he killed, and why they were all girls, he continued to tell me a story. Frank was at the birth of his child, the baby came out like a fetus, all fucked up and stuff, he said he remembers taking the baby and putting it back inside the vagina, I don’t know how that had correlation with why he wanted to kill but I left it there. After being back on the road for a  while now, Frank ended up stopping at a house of some kind, it was like a house but there was no walls or ceilings, just a single bedroom, in the middle of no where, there was a little girl laying in bed, of the age of about 8, Frankie went up to the little girl with a weird looking butter knife in his hand, he got to the bed and announced to me he would like to kill her, I told Frank ‘NO’ in a panicking voice because she would see my face, he carried on anyway by taking the girls head, lifting it up and trying to put the blunt knife into her throat upwards, the girl awoke not even scared, even know Frank was pushing the knife with all his force and I could see how much he was straining to get the knife in, it didn’t impale her, she then starts kicking her legs, he gets up laughing and says let’s just leave it, I told Frank we can’t do that because she had seen both out faces, he just sighed and walked around a corner, I then walked up the the girl and tried to do the same Frank had done with the knife, except I managed to cut her throat open, the girl still didn’t seem fazed at all, the knife wasn’t killing the girl, so I proceeded to put my hand into her throat, grabbing her throat and ripping it out, after this I then gouged her eyes out gruesomely, just in case she survived; I didn’t want her to be able to recognise me, I somehow didn’t have blood on my hands after doing it. I started to follow the path around the corner Frank had taken, rubbing my fingers together confused why there wasn’t any blood. I got around the corner and there was Frank, he saw me, turned around and just started to walk the way we came in, the scene we were in was like a tall block of flats with regular houses at the bottom, hard to explain. Anyway, I started to follow Frankie to the car, all of a sudden he falls to the ground, I run to him and ask what was the matter, I think he said something about a heart attack or something, but he was holding what was like a larger crocodile skin wallet/envelope, I took it off him and it was full of money, a lot of it, he looked at me and described he knew he would die right in this spot and that I should take the money, I opened the wallet again and stared at the wad of cash in awe, he got straight up and took the money from me, then started walking away disclaiming I only was using him for the money, I told him I was just looking because I had never seen such an amount, he just carried on walking to the car and I followed, we both got in and he just looked at me and gave a smile, I told him I was sorry and I didn’t want the money, he just looked straight and started to drive, I think he did that because he knew he’d got me.This is the end of my dream.",new,A serial killer befriended me.,1.0

She responds with something along the lines of ""I've done it to the others why wouldn't I do it to you"" and obviously that's quite upsetting. This is usually where I wake up in stressed out, cold sweat. 
 Some background...
*this is in real life now* I'm 19 and my girlfriend is 21. Close to the beginning of the relationship (about 4 months in) she actually cheated on me in real life with an old friend, I found out because the guy found out she had a boyfriend (me) and told me over Instagram, I forgave her for this (say what you like about me for that, but I'm happy in the relationship and I came here for advice about the dreams, not relationship advice so keep that in mind) we did talk about it when I confronted her and I did ask why she did something like that to me similar to in the dreams. She has a history of cheating on her boyfriends, this is why in the dream she replied ""I did it to the others"". 
  To sum up...
It's clear to me and I think it's probably clear to you too that I have some unresolved issues subconsciously about the time she cheated on my in real life and it's playing in my mind lately, and I'd just like to ask for some advice I guess: what can I do to end the nightmares/dreams? Should I have a discussion with my girlfriend about them? How do I work out what is bothering my subconscious in order to resolve it? I'm at the end of my rope mentally because of these nightmares and it's the worst way to start my morning so any help would be massively appreciated. Thanks.

For example, last night I dreamt I saw a video on the internet, I think it was on Reddit, showing two girls fighting with a guy. The title was ""what a dodge"" or something similar. It showed one girl holding the guy from behind while the other swung at him with a taser. The guy managed to miss being hit by the taser, grab a knife from one of the girls, and stab the girl with the taser in the thigh, hitting her femoral artery, causing massive blood spurts. All of this was slow-motion in the video, but only took about a second. How do I know?

Because, at some point later in my dream, I dreamt that I was there, walking behind the girls as they walked up on the guy to attack him. I remember seeing them swing the knife around, slice at a bush with it, swing a club around, etc.

Now, the attack happened beside a road, and when I was walking behind the girls and watching the attack, I remember thinking ""these people can see them walking around swinging a knife/they can see them attacking this guy, why aren't they driving away?""

But it could have have premature, and that's why it was in this bare room with me in this old metal white lead painted crib , where the paint had been coming off. I dunno if it was lead paint but it needed a new paint job, cause the iron or whatever metal was exposed. I'm not sure: we all might have been sick, and were trying to look for a cure or something.

     I have these weird rare dream experiences.  Maybe once a year. Or once every 3 years I will have a dream that is significant to me. There’s nothing about this dream that makes it significant other than the feeling. Just that it feels important at that moment when waking up. Over the years I’ve experienced those dreams coming true.  For example, I dreamt that my aunt died 3 years before my aunt died. Which sounds silly. I know. Let me explain. The dream starts with me looking down at my aunt in her bed. She is very sick. Family is all around her and we are all praying , then I wake up from the dream. That exact scenario happened when she died. I remember how everything looked. From what color the walls looked like. The clothes that people were wearing. That day was sad and terrifying to me because I’ve never experienced such craziness. I remember the way I felt when I had that dream. And it’s the same feeling I have with other dreams that have come true too.  These dreams are not so important as the other one. These dreams are random. Dreams of me reading a certain book.

I rush over to Josh and tell him what he did was wrong. Then I made him apologize to the other kid. After that I wake up. I wake up with that weird feeling that this dream is important. I wrote down this dream this time. Because I think Josh might be my son. And if this comes true in the future I will have my own proof that I dreamt it. I know this all sounds crazy.

First, I’d like to say I hope you have had a great day!

So the reason I’m making this post is because I’m a little concerned about a dream I had last night.

So a couple years ago, two weeks after I started using and becoming addicted to hard drugs I had a dream which looking back was a warning from my subconscious, spiritual guide, whatever it is. 

I was on my parents house balcony and huge waves were coming towards the house. My parents and I were running around the balcony trying to figure out what to do. The waves started crashing against the house. 

Looking back at that dream, some sort of higher power was warning me a storm is brewing if I don’t stop what I’m doing. A storm inevitably came in real life and I fortunately made it through to the other side. 

I’ve been clean and sober for almost a year and a half now and feel better than I ever have. 

This gets me to the dream I had last night. 

I was on the beach and started seeing VERY large waves coming up towards the shore. I got hit by a wave or two and felt a struggle, but eventually reached higher land. I was on a tall pillar on a small hill, now observing the waves, concerned for the others closer to the beach. 

It was a weird dream, and I’m scared it’s another warning sign that something bad is about to happen. I’m not doing anything I shouldn’t be doing. Staying clean, going to school, working and doing the best I can. 

I take dreams as a very deep connection with the subconscious spirit and the conscious spirit. Kind of like a psychological self helper type thing.

Any thoughts/advice/opinions/help will be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!

It went like this: In the dream, I was holding my own left hand, cleanly severed an inch or too from the wrist and with no blood at all. I remember going to my dad’s room to let him know somehow my hand was severed and I may need urgent medical help, to which he replied with “sort it out yourself”. I usually do solve my medical issues myself but given the magnitude of the situation I needed some support from someone I could trust. Leaving his room in disappointment, I look at the hand at the severed part and to my surprise, it looks like raw beef. 

At this moment I decide to reattach it, and somehow it sticks in a similar way a magnet sticks to iron, and I can move it normally once again but with great pain on my arm.  Then I decide to detach it, and my hand stops moving again as it is separated from my body. I reattach it and the same happens once more, I can move it but with great pain to my arm. Afterwards in my room I look at myself in the mirror and to my surprise, on my left shoulder (I had no shirt on) there is a clean cut straight to the bone, no blood, but the bone is clearly visible at the joint. This is where the dream ended.

I was around 8 or 10 when it happened.  One night while I was sleeping, I suddenly was transported into a horrible plane, one that seemed to be underground in a cavernous vein with brown and red hues.  I was being transported inside a cauldron which was being moved by wheels atop of a rail, connected to other cauldrons in front of me but empty.  As I was being pulled slowly and deeper into said cave-like realm I watched on both side demons and the like around bigger cauldrons which cries of people agonizing would be heard from.  The demons were laughing as they were turning the insides of the cauldrons with huge wooden spoons.  One of said cauldrons was close enough for me to peer into as I was being transported further inside and I noticed limbs of charred flesh and detached heads which had a look of horror on their cooked, burnt faces, still screaming in agony.  Their eyes were completely white, void of any life.

I was in chains while all this was happening, trapped and not being able to move while I was being pulled deeper into this Hellish nightmare.  All of the sudden I opened my eyes and vomited to the side of my bed for a good while.  Mother told me the entire time I was sleeping I was moaning and crying for help even though in said nightmare I do not recall doing such.  

I am not sure how someone my age would had come to dream such a thing nor I could possibly had done anything as a kid to warrant such horrifying experience.  I will say though, this was one of the most vivid nightmares which I still can recall with such detail and have not dreamt anything as horrific ever since, not even as an adult.

Last night I had a dream where there’s a massive live vote in the uk, all the rich and famous went to a show to carry out the vote, but there was also a show on. My parents were there with a steam engine showing off some great British things, I wasn’t allowed in so ran home, 

there’s a lot of people standing on streets watching on large “public” TVs, proper wall mounted and that, and I can’t get too doir of house so I jump the garden railings, and head inside.

I rush inside and realise the house is full with bustling party guests and can’t find my sister. I start asking all the djs to start packing up and turn all the TVs onto the live shows. Something I remember about the party is no one was drunk. Most people left, the djs packed up and I sat down on a sofa across from my sister and her boyfriend (j don’t recognise either of the people but they feel real and I enjoyed there company) we watch the show and a dj comes down from the floor above my sister goes to him pays the man and collects out voting papers on the way back to the sofa, I stare at her the whole way before muttering out “you’re evil” with a roll of the eyes and a cheeky grin “duh”. we sit down and start filling out the voting papers about 15 questions on it poorly printed out with an empty printer by its appearance. So hard to read I use my laptop while both he and her fill there’s in. I’m struggling to use my laptop so get a paper copy out the pack, I’m struggling to read the first question, the tv is flicking between famous and rich people filling in the same sheets.

I have woken up right now after having a weird dream that didn't quite let me sleep that well. I really think my subconscious was trying to tell me something especially related to my waking life these days (which I will get into later) so I want to hear your opinions on this if possible. Thank you so much!
So here we go. I dreamed I was in the appartment I am currently living in alone to study. Both of my parents were around too, my mom especially. At some point in the dream, I had a pigeon fly inside the house through the window. It let me hold it, but it started flapping its wings so I'd let go, which I did. Shortly after, I also saw a black rat appearing in the kitchen. When the black rat and the pigeon met, the rat jumped at it, killed and dragged it somewhere. I became very afraid of the rat, feeling like it was always watching me from somewhere. My parents would keep telling me that it's okay, there is no rat but I could see it roam around the house sometimes. It even tried to attack my other pets (that I also own IRL), a winter white hamster and a small black hamster. I remember going to bed and staying awake in the dark because I was afraid the rat would crawl in bed with me. So, one night, I felt like I finally saw it in my bed, but only its lower body part (the upper half having been chomped off). Disgusted and afraid, I called my mom who lifted up whatever there was on the bed, only to reveal it was either some black shoelace or a black rope, don't know for sure here.

There's one more aspect of this dream which occured whenever I would take a break from stressing over the rat. I carried a severed wounded little girl's foot with me in a handkerchief. I would take it with me wherever I go. By the end of the dream, I felt the need to show it to my parents for some reason, so I unwrapped it in front of them. I do not remember their exact reaction, but they might have told me something along the like of 'return the foot to that little girl, it's hers, not yours'.

I'm not even sure whether this should be called dream or nightmare, but I did wake up several times, and it only continued upon falling back asleep. On the other hand, I have these dreams quite often.

And now about what is going on in my waking life... well it is pretty much a mess. And I feel guilty. I have recently been clinically diagnosed with depression and begun treatment, after years of thinking I had suffered from it but never having the courage to speak up. Classic scenario, my family was not very supportive of me getting a diagnosis, they kept saying it was all in my head and I have no reason to feel bad about life, sometimes even going as far as insulting or even hitting me if I stated I felt like I'm a piece of shit/had low self esteem/you name it. I've been greatly discouraged in letting my insecurities come to surface, instead repressing them (since I could not to show signs of emotional distress around my parents and they were, for a long time, pretty much the only social contact I'd have - making friends was never an easy task for me). 

Looking back even further in life, I have a lot of frustrations related to my past, especially about how strict they were with me when I begun school. Primary school was not a pleasant experience for me, and although I was getting perfect grades 99% of the time, they were pressuring me to only focus on studying at the expense of every other hobby I might have had (which usually involved reading literature or encyclopedias, for some reason that did not count as learning because it was a pleasant experience and I wasn't doing it because I was obliged, or afraid of something). What I mean by that is, my teacher used to beat me and a few other students, and my mom was supporting my teacher in this regard, saying that it's how you teach someone to care about school (as if I did not in the first place). It usually begun from an incomplete homework but could have arised from something as stupid as me panicking after she was yelling at me for getting disoriented. At home, the situation was not looking good either, my parents were on the verge of breaking up as one of them had cheated but I was expected to focus solely on my grades. Keep in mind this all happened when I was under 10 (I am 19 now).

My point is, I now believe that I finally realise this has made me set unrealistic expectations for myself. As these expectations kept crushing me, I became less and less able to motivate myself to perform even the simplest of tasks, thinking that 'I am a failure' and 'it will never be good enough anyways'. Today, I have finally spoke with my mother about my depression for the first time, having written about it on a blog which I gave her to read. To my surprise she supported me and said she is proud of me for having the strength to finally share this with her (parents do learn from their mistakes at least). However it was nothing but bittersweet for me. I lack a sense of direction so badly that I straight up told her she and dad are wasting their money on me for uni, I felt stressed and restless all day, havent slept in like 36 hours and refused to attend one of my final exams as I could not stand still enough and concentrate to study for it, as this whole uni thing has been one of the main reasons I have been feeling so down lately, upon realising I cannot concentrate properly to study (highschool was a piece of cake). She told me it was ok and she is fine with me retaking the exam itself but I feel like shit for being so... into her face about it. I really felt like I did not deserve their efforts or words of encouragement. If there's one instance where I truly ever felt like I did not, I'd pick yesterday when this happened. I told her I felt like quitting college until I figure myself out, at least partially but she said I shouldn't rush to making decisions and just take this exam a while later. It makes me feel so guilty thinking I am just dragging on with uni and making them spend way more money than they should if I were just a healthy, well adjusted person.

I am afraid about what future holds for me. I am thinking that my dream might have summed up all the fears that rushed through my head the previous day, which is why I found it so interesting. I've had longer dreams, but this one just feels like it speaks so much louder than these. I wonder if the little girl foot is a metaphor for something or it appeared in my dream just because I saw a post about a girl having a horrible injury on her foot due to child neglect before going to bed.

""The Angel's love is supreme because they hobble, hobble, cut and hobble"". This was written on the back of my shirt, I wasn't aware of this, every time someone would see it on my shirt they would first tell me it is inappropriate before reading it out to me.

So I googled the phrase and found nothing, would anyone here happen to know what this means? I can give the events of the dream that happened before this however I doubt they mean anything since they were really random and seems completely unrelated and I can't really remember them fully. 

So I was a Buddhist monk for 2 years in the rainforests of Thailand in the international monastery where everyone was mostly white if not a foreigner(not Thai). 

So anyway this is where the dream begins, I am back in the monastery, it is in the morning just before the daily meal but I am not sitting with the monks, I am sitting in the crowd of lay people(the normal people who come to offer monk's food). All the monks are sitting there, the German Abbot(head monk) is sitting at the front center giving a blessing chant to the people, but one of the junior monks stops him and tells him he isn't chanting correctly then they both laugh and are talking like bros debating whether he made a mistake or not. In real life this would never ever happen even if the senior monk made a mistake the juniors would never say a word, even if the other monks there were also senior they wouldn't really say anything. Then suddenly I'm outside a court looking inside, watching the judges press charges for something ridiculous I think but I can't remember then some woman comes out and sees the back of my shirt and I already explained the rest at the beginning of this post.

First time I died: I was helping protect a group of people, inside a house, from armed men. I walked down a staircase and into a room with a few of the ones I helped escort. I turn around after the people I helped has run into a safer area, and one of the armed people stand there. I tried to deflect his stab but failed, and got stabbed right in the chest. This irl. Felt like a weird ""buzzing"" in the area I got stabbed, and I felt the same ""buzz"" on my spine as well.
I fell to the ground unable to close my eyes I looked down at the sword, and up at the killer, after which I woke up.

Second time: me and to of my best friend were on a killing spree. (Btw, not aggressive by nature, and would never wish to harm anyone) We shot people, though, they had no reaction to it, and the people who were shot, were some of my closest friends. When they were all gone, I looked for a way out of the building this took place in, but failed to do so. My friend told my to shoot myself instead. I felt a very real sense of horror and fright but did it alas. I didn't wake up this time.

Third time: this was right after we shot ourselves. I was put back before when I died. This time I found a way outside and saw two of those towers that carries power cables, and a tall building. Still on the suicide mission, literally, I thought I would be unable to get into the house, the small cable thing as too small to die from, and the big was too far way. I was suddenly hit with a incredible feeling of anxiety, and didn't wanna die that way, instead wanting to shoot myself again. Though when I went back inside, my other best friend was in a lab coat, and strapped me down to a chair, and gave me a lethal injection. I just felt I was unable to move, and suddenly felt really tired. 
The I woke up.

0.0,ao8gdx,0.0,1.0,"It started with going to a cabin up north. I live in the midwest, so anywhere near Lake Superior is usually what we mean. It was as simple cabin, something rustic. The sort that almost looks like it wouldn’t have electricity and running water. I think it was the spring because I don’t remember it being particularly warm, and a lot of my clothes included long sleeves.

I was allowed to bring a friend and we were probably in our mid-teens in this dream. So, being bratty teenage girls, we made the most of exploring the forests that surrounded this little cabin. I remember tall grasses too. It reminded me of where my friend grew up when we were that age, so maybe my subconscious pulled from those memories. However, as we explored is when we triggered the strange events that would send my dream into a nightmare, then into an even stranger finale.

The first night of a week long trip to the cabin started with typical things that you see in a haunting movie. Creaks, knocks, scratches. All the sounds that tell a viewer that something paranormal was happening. What I didn’t know, that this would be the first night of a series of jumps in the dream. The next day would fast forward nearly to the end of the week. To the day that my best friend would disappear. We would be exploring the woods again, tramping through it like awkward teenagers. Until we would split up, getting lost. We never could find her that night, and even the next day. It was as if she disappeared.

The next part felt like a dream within a dream. We returned home early, I remember, because my friend had gone missing. I had dreams about something hunting us in those woods. Chasing us. Something that felt evil. It was unseen until it was on top of us. In my dream, it looked like my friend. And then, I was looking at the scene from a different perspective as this creature drug its nails through the skin on my face. It pulled away like dragging a toothpick through clay. Until it took my face and became me. I had those nightmares within my dream for years, refusing to return to the cabin until I was older. I was a little more brave, or a lot more reckless by this point in the dream.

I stomped through the woods, provoking whatever darkness lived out there. I remember the feeling of being chased. I felt safer inside of the cabin, but there was no one else there. I was alone. It was like I was back in time, watching some strange scene unfold of the life of the man who lived there. A man who gradually went mad from the isolation. A man that cherished his privacy even when people came to try to get him to move off of his land. He would kill them, cut off their faces to keep, and discard the rest.

When I woke, it jumped forward a few more years. I was out of high school, but still at home. This house wasn’t a place that I recognized. I just knew that is where I lived. When I came downstairs, there was talk of us going back up to the cabin. I remember being afraid, not wanting to go. But for whatever reason, my father wanted the energy that was there. He wanted to bring it back with us. Whatever darkness was tied to that place was something that he wanted to uncover. I remember referring to it as ‘ the faceless ghost’. My dream jumped again and we were digging an old wooden crate out of the ground in the woods around that cabin. Inside was filled with random items. Things that made the entity appear as being more human that monster. The collection of things of a lonely man pulled at my heartstrings in this dream.

Flash forward again. I am laying in the bath. We have since buried the crate somewhere on our property as a way to protect our land from unwanted visitors. We have lived in relative peace with the spirit. So I am laying in the bath with the curtain drawn when the lights flicker. I know that it is there. Just visiting, curious. I sit up, warm in the water though the air outside the curtain is cool.

I heard a voice, close enough to tell me that it sat just outside of the curtain, almost as if it mirrored my position as I hugged my knees to my chest. I wasn't afraid for whatever reason. I didn't feel threatened. Instead, I just talked to it. Whatever entity was outside the curtain. We spoke casually and I can't remember the entire conversation. I do remember asking if the entity could be tangible. If it was real. And to prove it, a hand snuck through the edge of the curtain. It didn't have claws or blackened nails. It was just a hand. Solid as my own. I reached out and laced my fingers with theirs. It felt warm, like how people do. I questioned how it was possible and there was no real answer that I remember. Finally, I pull the curtain away to look at this entity that seems to have haunted me for a major part of my life and IT'S WES BENTLEY. Don't know why or how, he is more like his character John Lowe in AHS Hotel than anything. But we share a kiss and I wake up.

So that is how I dreamt that I fell in love with a murder ghost that looked like Wes Bentley. Wes, if you happen to see this, don’t @ me because I'm already sorry.

This one felt so vivid and real and I still think about it periodically, wondering what it could mean.

Anyway, I remember in the dream I was getting out of bed and walking out of my bedroom.  It must have been morning or early afternoon because the sun was so bright.  When I walk out of my bedroom, the living room is on the right and the kitchen and bathroom are on the left. The living room has a huge window.

I was walking towards the kitchen when I felt the urge to turn and look out the window. There was a thin woman with pale skin who was holding up a plate or just something flat and white over her face, facing towards me in the middle of my living room.  She was just standing still.  In that instant I knew I was not supposed to see her.  I guess she knew I could see her as well because she threw the plate to the side and leapt at me.  I screamed but no sounds came out, it just felt like air was leaving my lungs.  I fell to the floor and I remember using all my strength to raise my arms, but couldn't.

-----
In the dream, I wasn’t sure if I was running or being chased. But I was climbing up the staircase of an old English castle. Cobblestone of a dark medieval color that was slightly cool to the touch. I wasn’t sure if I was naked or not but I noticed I was wearing flipflops for sure. Eventually, I reached the top of the staircase and as I halted my right flipflop flew off and fell in front of this person… He kind of reminded me of Sméagol from lord of the rings but it was such a blur that I can’t describe him for you. All I could focus on was the ladder in front of me. This ladder was in the center of the room and stood out like a light in the darkness. It was chrome, cold and it was just standing there. I didn’t look up I just knew I had to climb it. I tried to grasp the first step but a part of me didn’t trust the ladder. It didn’t feel natural, the same way you could never hurt a baby, it just felt wrong. 

I didn’t even care that I only had one flip-flop on or if the ladder was cold. I had this urge to get to the top. So I tried climbing. Resting my forearm on the step and grabbing one end and doing the same for the other as I rise. It felt like I was hugging the ladder. 

As I climbed for what seemed like ten minutes the cobblestone walls just stopped. There was no roof. It seemed like a large chimney. But as I climbed I stopped and looked at where I was… I was high, very high, the Mountaintops looked like those small sand hills similar to the kind at the beach. Even the clouds touching the mountain tops looked surreal. 

As I stood still I noticed the ladder didn’t feel cold anymore. It felt warm, like wood on a summer day. It’s like it knew that I was trusting it as I climbed. I started climbing again and the more I rose the safer I felt. The only chill I was feeling was the cold untouched air around me. 

I don’t think I realized… but at some point, I reached the top. I just rise up into this dark room and everything just disappears. The ladder and scenery below me just vanish and all there is around me is emptiness. Then I realized my eyes were closed, so I opened them. All I could see in my view was black walls, the room was cramped, no bigger than a cardboard box. It felt like I was in a bush, surrounded by orange branches like they were on fire… not bright, but hot enough to give off a little ember-glow.

But what really caught my eye was this window in front of me. I crept closer to the window and see my home. Earth… Space. 

I felt warm and cozy, almost comfortable.
I wasn’t sure if I was in a spacecraft, or dead. But I could hear faint giggles behind me. Like little children were behind me watching with me as the earth spun around. At this point, I forgot I was in a dream and just let go.

Then I just gather myself and start to get up. I needed to keep going up. I don’t know how, whether I found an elevator or another ladder, but I just rose up and I was somewhere else. I think I was sitting… but I definitely was in another place entirely. It was bluish. No earth, just floating dark bubbles, I could have been in a megaverse surrounded by different universes. 

I wasn't feeling scared. But I just took one last look and suddenly I woke up.

I remember looking at the televisions, and on the news where the reporter was shouting into her microphone, ""A firestorm has been ravaging the town!""  
I remember going, ""Dude what?"" and thinking about how it began.

The dream shifted into a restaurant where a guy was fixing a heater (or something like it). I remember seeing several things (like papers and napkins, flammable stuff) that was around the heater and going, ""Well, of course it's going to catch on fire.""  
But nope, that didn't happen. The man got his sleeve sucked INTO the heater and I was outside the window as he stared right at me with absolute horror in his bright blue eyes. The heater exploded and surprisingly, the window didn't shatter.

I was perfectly calm as everything happened. The firestorm itself looked like an orange-red hurricane with something in the middle of the clouds being white. Heat and humidity was rampant, people were shouting about how it's ""the end times"", Revelations, Biblical stuff. Again, perfectly calm as I saw people getting burned alive, buildings getting destroyed, everything.

Just staring at the firestorm and practically not giving a single care in the world. Didn't care about the people getting incinerated, nor about the destroyed buildings collapsing, nothing.

I'd say the firestorm itself looked kinda similar to a nuclear blast, but it wasn't shaped like a mushroom or anything, and no smoke at all. It was like a mix of a hurricane and a tornado (it touched the ground) and spun similar to a funnel, but on a MUUUUUCH larger scale.

I remember this dream happened around 2 years ago during the summer, it was a weekend when I was playing METAL GEAR SOLID 3, the dream was very vague visually, yet I remember the full plot, I was a teenage agent for a stereotypical Spy agency that sent spies to kill or get info, my main mission was to hunt down a spy who was deemed a rogue agent for unknown reasons, I agreed to take the mission, the rogue spy was an older man, but was in no way weak, he still had high grade weapons & was well maintained in martial arts, he was hiding away in a closed Cosco, I still don't know if it was abandoned or just closed for the night, it sounds like a silly setting at first, fighting an old man spy in a grocery store, but it the more I think, it makes a little bit sense, Cosco is a giant store, where anyone can hide, & being a high trained agent, he would be able to disable any security easily, as said it was a very visually vague dream, I can't remember what exactly I did, but I do remember the general jist of what happened, I was jumping from tall storage stack to another, while he says random philosophical taunts & quotes on war & politics, it was a very long game of of predator VS. predator in a giant maze, the more he talks about his story & his thoughts on life, I start finding random journal entries of his life, saying things that he was fighting during the Korean War, but he kept referring to it as the Korean Cold War, as he knew it was a Proxy War funded by the U.S. & Russia, but had to defect once to save a village or city, saving many lives, but ultimately costed him, making him a wanted rogue agent, to put salt upon injury, he had a son & wife that were lied to, where the government said he died in battle, his son became a father to a family, making him a grandfather, but he knew he couldn't visit his family as he could be found easily by doing so, I start feeling more sympathy, & start to question what I was told, this rogue agent isn't the villain my agency made him out to be, finally in the the last seen, I remember in a frozen food isle, I finally found him, holding his AK-47, looking for me, he says something along the lines of that I am a new agent of the new generation, & I must do what agents do & follow my orders, I don't remember how I took him down, but as I walked over to him while he is injured, laying on the floor, I hold my gun away from him, saying that he isn't a villain, but he grabs the barrel of my gun & points it  at his head, saying that I am a great agent, & I must complete my mission, impressed with my skills in finding him, but not getting killed unlike the rest of the agents that have tried & failed at killing him, I start breaking down, tearing up as he says he failed at complying to his orders, & tells me not to go down the way he did, in the final moment, he closes his eyes, & says
""Complete your mission....""
.....
*BANG!*
I drop to my knees, now crying into my hands as my gun falls to the ground, the flood of many emotions came into my head, this man was a hero, but was never & never will recognized as one, he may have been able to watch his family grow from a distance, but he never got to talk to them, he never got to handle his wife's hand at her death bed, he never got to see his son get married, he never got to talk with his son who is a man, he never got to see his grandchildren grow up, his family will never know his heroic actions, & as such, he died a forgotten hero.

I dreamed that my company relocated me to Hong Kong. They got me an apartment in one of those typical old buildings that looked like [this](https://imgur.com/a/qqxuVGo). The apartment has 2 entrances, 1 main entrance at the front of the building and another side entrance on a dark shady alley. The building has a small security counter at the main entrance. 

The flat is minimally decorated. There is a 4-seater dining table in the living room, a small kitchen, and 3 bedrooms. I share this apartment with 2 male colleagues (I am a female, married, hetero) from the Hong Kong office that i have never met. I do not know the names of the 2 colleagues but i remember 1 looking older, bald and short. The other one younger, tall and thin.

The first night i reached Hong Kong, they invited me to join them for dinner at the flat after i unpacked. I welcomed the gesture. We talked about ourselves. Dinner was fun with them and i had a good feeling about these 2 flat mates. 

I woke up the next day, prepared for work and when i stepped out of my room, the older colleague was sitting at the dining table. I asked him where the younger colleague is, and he said the younger man has went to work early. So i said goodbye and left for work. When i reached the office, i looked for the younger man but his colleagues said he did not come to work today. My day at work was uneventful and i went back to the apartment at the end of the day and turn in early for the night. I did not see the younger man.

The 2nd day, i prepared for work as usual and when i stepped out of my room, the older man came out of the kitchen in a white apron. There was some blood splatter on the left bottom corner of the apron. He was wearing a t-shirt and shorts underneath the apron. I asked the older man if he had seen the younger man, he said he left for work early again. I began to feel uneasy about the disappearance of the younger man but brushed it off and went to work. 

At work, i did not see the younger man, and his colleagues didnt see him either. And as my day ended, i felt more and more uneasy. I decided that i was not going to go back to the apartment as i was afraid i would be a victim of a murder. I roamed around the night market and saw a policeman patrolling. So, i told the policeman that my flat mate has disappeared and i suspected the older man had killed him. But the policeman refused to help as there was no evidence. 

I was adamant to report this to the police. So, i asked around if anybody knows the nearest 24hr police station. Finally, a taxi driver knows and he brought me to the police station. Whist at the police station, i made a report about it and told them that i am not going to the apartment today. The police lent me one the their cells for the night to sleep. 

And i woke up. ",new,Interpretation on a Realistic Murder Mystery Dream,1.0

I think it started out as like, me, my dad and a regular customer from where I work going into some building that needed its lighting fixed. I can't remember much after that until a point where I stepped on a piece of sand and it got stuck in my foot. I pulled the piece of sand off of my foot and ended up pulling a large chunk of foot flesh out with it. Part of my foot was hollowed out, and I could actually see through the top of my foot after that. For awhile I searched for a doctor or even a nurse, but we couldn't find one. I could still walk and my group decided to just go ahead and start fixing the lighting. Every time I looked own, even though I wasn't twisting my foot, I could see the bottom of it and the gaping hole, getting wider each time I looked at it. It was just so... grotesque, and I wanted to scream in my dream but I couldn't. It wasn't even a nightmare, I didn't wake up with a rapid heartbeat or sweating or with a sudden jerk, I was just in a mild panic for a bit.

I Also visit locations that I have been to in real life. Except they look nothing like it. But it looks the same in the dream when I re visit it. 

I don’t know if that makes sense but here’s some examples. 

I live in Canada and go to Canada’s Wonderland a few times a year. I always dream about it, except the park has a completely different layout with different attractions. But the dream layout is the same each time I visit it

My hometown has a different look and feel to it. It’s darker, bigger and has a creepier feel to it. But it always looks the same when I’m in it in my dreams

I always dream I go to the mall. This mall is completely different than any mall I visit, but alas, this malls layout in my dream is the same every time. (Also it’s always closing and I can never find something to buy)

The scenario changes but the sensation is the same afterwards. 

Basically, at the dream at some point I will feel I cant move because a energy like being in a vortex of a weird force is pushing me or restraining me and a gutural voice will come from me, after a while I thought the voice came was me but the more I dream this, I feel something speaks through me, this last time was saying for us (my family and I to move out).
Eventually after fighting this force (trying to move or scream at it), I wake up and my skin gets like that sensation when you listen really good music were all its hairs straighten up.

I had a dream the other night that stuck with me and I’ve been itching to find out what it means. Since google has been unreliable, I decided to grace you guys with this somewhat disturbing dream I had.



In it, it included just me walking around, visiting my sibling and abusive mother, I got high and I was having a panic attack. I thought this was real until I woke up. It was crazy. I never think that.
The main part of my dream was that I looked in one of the drawers in my kitchen and I saw my right hand, cut off at the elbow. Or what I thought was my right hand. It was bloody and covered in plastic wrap. Immediately I got a sick feeling in my stomach and it felt like something was telling me I used it for dark magic. I had both of my hands, it seemed like I shed that hand and grew one back. 

Seeing my hand was so weird. I had to do something with it. Bloody and looking freshly severed; I went outside and I saw a little mossy pit in the ground. I put it on top of this and it slowly sunk in. 


I’m seriously wondering what this dream meant. I just found out in therapy that the root of a lot of my issues stems from shame and guilt - from abusive relationships and people in my life. It’d help a lot if someone could figure this out for me. Thanks so much!

The dream is me, tiny, and inside an endless bright white room with nothing in it and no one else around. I can't see the end of the room in any direction and it always seems like I'm hiding inside a giant defect in the floor (almost like a crack, I'm assuming so no one can find me). I'm always whispering to my self, which in the dream seems like another person is there that I can't see. It's really myself obviously, but my mind acts like it's another person with other opinions entirely. I'm always worried about getting out of the room and trying to sort out a plan with myself. Then right when I start to say the plan (ie: ""Okay so we should do""), the dream switches to something else unrelated. If I remember correctly, I used to have the dream recur a few times in the same night when I was younger. Now it's only once if it appears in a night then it's gone for a while.

I grew up in a house that fought a lot. I had everything to keep me safe and all that, but my parents were constantly fighting and I always felt like the family was going to fall apart at any time. So I guess there was never long term stability and I couldn't do anything to stop or interfere in the fight. I'm sure that's kind of where the dream comes from but I'm curious why it would recur all the time and why it still does to now.

I guess the real question I have is why would my brain decide to show me back the exact thing that is bothering me yet not pose it any way that would be beneficial. Clearly, despite ""getting out"" (I moved out at 18), I haven't solved the mystery if I still have the dream, right? TIA!

They had 2 pet cats and a whole lot of dogs, like 50+, which would be weird irl but in the dream my brain just accepted it as normal lol.

Anyway, night time came and the mother had just come home, looking a little drunk. She told me that I had to continue to stay as she had something to do outside and she wouldn't be 5 minutes. I agreed.

I put the kids to bed. I thought they looked a little battered up, kinda bruised everywhere, but my dream brain didn't think much of it. Then I went to find the 2 cats to amuse myself until the mother came back. I also noticed the dad hadn't come home yet.

Then I heard a horrible screaming sound, something like cats in pain, and a woman yelling really loudly. I traced the sound to a room and saw the woman beating up the cats. I yelled at her to stop but you know how it is when you try to yell in dreams, nothing actually happens. So I quickly packed my things and booked it out of there.

Once home, I called my friends and told them what happened. Then one of them mentioned the bruised kids and we figured maybe the mother was an abusive alcoholic asshole. We came up with a plan to rescue the kids and the cats. I mentioned that the cats were really beyond healing (idk how I knew, my dream brain just knew that they were beyond help) so I suggested the only way to not cause them pain was to put them to sleep. Everyone sadly agreed.

So the next day my friends and I snuck in the house. My friend and I would silently inject the cats with something so they would die a peaceful death, and 2 other friends would go to drug the 50+ guard dogs so they wouldn't obey their owner's command to attack, while the last friend would smuggle the kids out the house. None of us thought to keep watch, though.

Everything went very smoothly up to the point when the friend tried to smuggle the kids out of the house. She was taking very long and everyone else sent me inside to check on her. Unfortunately while both of us were trying to get the kids out while avoiding the drunk mother crying over the dead cats, we got caught. The mother accused us of killing the cats and all I remember saying was ""at least they're in a better place now, away from you"". She got mad and tried to chase after us, then tried to manipulate her kids into staying with her. When that didn't work, she whistled for the guard dogs, but their brains were drug-riddled and didn't hear her. We eventually managed to get outside to the truck, loaded up the kids, and had some debate over whether we should take the dogs too, because she might have been abusing them. Eventually we decided to take all 50+ of them.

Then we drove off in the truck, dropping my friend and the kids at the police station. We took the dogs to a local shelter and all of them eventually got adopted. Next day I turned on the news and the mother was in jail for animal and child abuse.

  A few nights ago I dreamt that I was asked to work a shift last minute. The strange part was that it was for a job from years ago and a boss I hated. They needed extra hands so I said yes and agreed to 12-4.
   By some miracle, the same day as work I was told my grandpa had been brought back to life! It was the happiest moment in all my life, he is my favorite person and I miss him every day. The thought of seeing him again filled me with so much joy. 
   However, I still had to work. My boss pressured me into staying until 9:00, insisting I agreed to that time when I hadn't, saying it didn't matter that I could see my grandpa once more.
    In the end, I didn't want to inconvenience anyone by leaving early. Through tears, I worked the shift. I woke up before I was able to finish work and see my grandpa.

0.0,anybrc,3.0,5.0,"In my dream our house was broken into. My family and I were together just talking about each other. Then we heard a crashing sound. We snapped our head to the direction of the sound and there were 3 people wearing black ski masks and black pants and black shirts. We were all shocked for a second then without realizing it I began to run towards one of them. I tackled one of them to the ground then there was a big flash of light.

I wasn't in our house anymore. I felt hot and sweaty. I open my eyes and I saw the sun then I saw my feet but I wasn't walking I was being dragged. I look to my left and right and saw those people wearing black before then I a big flash of light blinded me again.

I open my eyes yet again and I saw I was in a jungle or forest of sorts. I was lying down but quickly sat up and looked around my surroundings. I found a calendar, a notebook, a tent and some banana leaves covered with what seemed to be blood. I stood up but I felt something extremely weird. I didn't feel heavy I was as light as feather when I stood up. I looked down at my body and saw that my body was still intact. No wounds or any injuries whatsoever but then I looked at where I was lying and there was my body lying down lifeless. Not moving whatsoever. There were no wounds or injuries either on my original body. I felt something inside me sink to the bottom of my stomach then another flash of light blinded me.

I open my eyes and I realize I was walking down a street. It was nighttime and the weather was a little rainy but not too rainy. I could still feel that sinking feeling on my body. I was thinking about heaven or hell. I contemplated whether it existed or not because I wasn't even summoned to either of them. It was just me alone then I felt myself get pulled back. It was the sensation of being in a rollercoaster but it was going in reverse in a very fast pace. Everything was a blur I couldn't see anything clear.

I was brought back to the jungle or forest part but I wasn't lying down. I was standing up and I saw that I was looking at the 3 people in black and one of them was carrying my original body. They placed my body down with my face facing the ground. Then I saw one of them pulling out a spear from thin air. It was colored black. My original body was moving a bit but I could see that my original body was exhausted. My original body was taking heavy breaths then one of them raised the spear and plunged it into my back. My original body reached with both my arms and legs for the sky but it was too late. The person raised the spear again and all of them vanished. I ran towards my body and placed him in a lying position. Then I looked around my surroundings again and found the same items in the previous area of my dream. The calendar, a notebook, a tent and the banana leaves under my original body. The calendar was marked December 2, 2019 and the notebook was empty. No writings. The tent itself was also empty. I looked around again then I was brought back to the streets but there wasn't a flash of light.

I stood there on street for about 5 minutes I think before I started walking again. I came across a comfort room one for men, one for women. The door to the women's opened and I saw two teenage girls with their little sister I assume. The two don't even bother to look at me because they were busy chatting to one another but the little girl looked at me and smiled. I was filled with happiness when I saw her smile my body was warm. I crouched down and reached my hands toward her she did the same and I could actually feel her hands. They were soft and warm that they filled me with tears. I looked at the two girls and they stared at little girl and said ""Come on, we're leaving."" The sinking feeling felt a bit lighter now and I let go of the little girl's hands. I stood up and waved goodbye to her and she did the same. I walked off into cold street and another flash of light hit me.

I was with my family. I could see them and they could see me. I was happy but still filled with that same sinking feeling but a bit uplifted. I asked my mom if I had a funeral and if they went to the funeral. They said yes and explained to me how my body was found and how they felt when they heard the news. They were depressed when they found out and cried when they went to the funeral they explained how all of my friends even went to the funeral. I cried my eyes out when I heard that then I asked them to take me to my grave and they did so. We arrived and I saw that my grave stone said 2002 - 2019 I felt my heart sink deeper when I found out that beside my graves were my family members but there wasn't any indication of when they died. I asked them how did they die and I was relieved to hear that it was of old age. I cried again even harder this time then I woke up.

My dream began with me hanging out with my parents at a mall. I don't remember why we were there but I remember noticing strange men following us. I decided to use the restroom and almost instantly I awoke in a dark cold room. There wasn't anything in it just me and about 20 other kids, we were tied up and a man walked in with a heavy Russian accent. I don't exactly remember what he said but he explained that we were ""lucky to be apart of the this program"" he left the room and I felt very queasy and I fainted. When I awoke men were grabbing us pulling us out of the chairs I thought they were just more Russians but I caught a glimpse of a symbol on one of their hats. All I saw was a sickle and hammer (I have no background in Russian history so idk if they actually had the sickle and hammer on their hats), I don't know how but I actually felt disbelief in a dream. The Soviet soldiers explained to us that we had traveled back in time and they knew we were coming. They dragged us into a hall that was guarded by 20 soldiers. When I looked out a window I noticed that we were pretty high up. 

Then I'm not even kidding Joseph Stalin walked in he looked exactly like the pictures I had seen. He just walked in and walked out. Anyway I hatch a plan that we tackle the guards and jump out the window with them and use them as a cushion to break our fall. So then every kid is grabbing guards and plowing through windows and we actually come out unscathed but we had to sprint to a fence to get over and we'd be free. But then machine guns went off about 6 kids beside got gunned down. We were eventually captured and put in a very small room. It was guarded by armor. It was like someone was wearing it, but there wasn't anyone underneath. It was just floating armor. Anyways I decided to bull rush this ghost armor thing and end up incapacitate it somehow. This guard takes us to a secret passage where I fight another ghost warrior and defeat it. The passage leads us to downtown Moscow and this is the moment my dream becomes a movie. Like I could see myself third person but ""Moskau"" started playing, so I'm running away from the police and some heavily armored soldiers. I don't dream me could here but all I hear is ""Moscow! Moscow!"" as I'm weaving and parkouring with some other kids. We end up running to the Russian countryside and we run by some stables in a small village and in the hay I find a Xbox One (I can't make this stuff up.) in like the mid 1920s I end up using the Xbox to get back to the future and safe with my family again. 
TL;DR Russia kidnaps me and sends me back in time, I fight ghosts, and run away from Soviet soldiers while ""Moskau"" by Dschinghis Khan was playing, stumble across Xbox One in mid 1920s travel back to the future.

When I was 21, I lived with my boyfriend of the time. He worked 3am-noon, and almost always, his alarm would wake me. One morning after he left, I had gotten up, turned the bedside lamp on, and decided to do some writing in a notebook. There were weird sounds in the driveway, so I walked through the apartment to the bathroom window, where I could easily see out but no one would see me looking. The boyfriend was in his car, which was running, and he was staring in my direction directly at me, almost threateningly. It made my heart race, it was so creepy that it woke me up. 

So now I'm full of adrenaline, I fully wake up and turn the bedside lamp on. Start writing like in my dream, about my dream. Weird sounds happen once more, but I'm convinced that I'm awake now, so I assure myself it's nothing and go to the bathroom window again to look out at the driveway. Boyfriend is staring again in my exact spot, this time his face stretches and distorts into a scary indescribable demon face. I wake up. 

I sit up, turn the light on, calm myself down, and stay in my bedroom. Now I can see from my bed that there is a bright blue light shining into the front door (right next to the bathroom). I slowly go to look. I can't grasp the image memory but I know there were some kind of blue creatures, coming into my home. In terror, I woke up. 

This time when I awake, I leave the light off. I wait in bed and try to be quiet. The blue lights come again. I fall off of my bed in fear, wrapped in my down comforter. I can't handle how my heart feels like it's going to explode. My back keeps bending further and further back into an impossible angle. It becomes that I'm out of my body, watching my body contort. 

Then I'm awake again. I stay tucked in bed under my comforter, peeking an eye out, listening and trying to breathe normal. Again I see the blue light. I close my eyes and tell myself it's not real, try to will myself into another dream. 

When I open my eyes again, I hide fully under my comforter, and peek through the blanket. Blue light fills my room and I haven't moved. I'm so terrified at this point that I'm incapable of taking a look. I make a little pocket above my head to let breathable air into my little blanket cacoon. I think that I fell back asleep again. 

This time I open my eyes and I feel such intense anxiety, worse than any panic attack I've experienced. I'm looking at the blue light shining through my comforter, and my head is telling me that I am having an actual heart attack. No joke, I thought I was dying. I made my peace quickly and told myself, just close your eyes and let it be over, now is your time. Don't fight it, it will only make it worse. Let go. 

And then I woke up, this time actually in real life (or whatever you want to call it). The time was about 3:40 am, so that whole dream sequence was probably only about a half hour of sleep. 

That morning I went into work at 6am and left an hour later because my heart was still skipping around and making me feel like I was going to pass out. I legit feel like I had a heart attack. I went to the doctors that day, doc didn't take me seriously, told me it was anxiety and sent me on my way. I may never know what the hell all that dream panic was about.

It started with me walking into a McDonald's that looked like it was pulled straight out of the 90s. It was sort of full, but there was no line, sort of like I walked in just after they finished up their rush hours. Anyway, realizing I was at a McDonald's in the 90s, I ordered a 10 piece Chicken McNugget meal with Szechuan sauce because, you know, when in Rome...

After ordering my food, I sort of unconsciously knew that I was in a dream because I knew I was never going to get my order since I never had the Szechuan sauce and my brain wouldn't know what flavor to put to it. But, I decided to wait around for it anyway to see what my brain might come up with.  So, I started talking to this girl who was there before me also waiting for her food and we ended up talking for about an 30 minutes in the dream. That's when things got weird. I took a second to actually look around at my surroundings and saw that all the ""people"" that were in the McDonald's were faceless husks of people, and I freaked out a little. Then, the girl I was talking to pulled me to the side and whispered to me to not look at them and pretend that I didn't notice that they weren't real. I could feel them looking at me and I felt like any sudden movement would've provoked them. I tried to play along for a little bit, but soon decided that I needed to leave. 

I told her I was going to leave and she told me I couldn't because they wouldn't let me. I told her I didn't care and slowly made my way to the door by the drive through, pretending I was going back to the front counter to wait for my food. As I was walking over to the door, she kept telling me that I couldn't leave becoming more desperate. I could feel the husks staring at us and knew that they were getting ready to stop me at any moment. I stopped short of the door and stood at the counter to try and calm the husks by making think I was asking about my order. After I mustered up enough courage to make a move for the door, just as I was about to open it, she grabbed my arm and begged for me not to leave. I turned to look at her for a second and the look of pure terror on her face shook me to the core. There were tears streaming down her face and, in that moment, I felt the full force of her unbridled fear. 

In that moment, she felt real. No one in my dreams ever feels real, but she did. And I felt like, wherever I was, she was the only real person there. And I was the first other real person to be there for a long time. She was lonely and didn't want to go back to being alone. 

I took a look outside the door and saw that the McDonald's was in the middle of an endless white void and when I turned back around, the McDonald's was completely empty. I woke up shortly after.

Ever since that dream, I've had a weird nostalgia for the 90s, going so far as to genuinely wish to go back in time to live it for myself (since I was born in 98 and never really lived through it).

0.0,anun1z,2.0,1.0,"My first post on Reddit! I'm on mobile.

I had a weird dream, I went to a friend's house for a group sleepover. I never knew these people in real life. 

I think the host was Donna from ""that 70's show"" but I don't know her actual name, so she was just Donna. 

So at some point they decided it would be a great idea to start summoning a demon or some shit. We at each sat at a point of a pentagram, and a few others sat in-between to make a circle. 

After some whoopla, I was just sitting there concerned not chanting or anything. When this venom looking like creature rose from the ground, and started attacking people.

I hid in a closet, it killed everyone. Found and killed me. I woke up in the closet, and looked around, it was empty and eerily quiet. 

I started finding my stuff because, ""I'm getting the hell out of here"". I found most of my stuff, but not my shoes. I creep around the house, because I think the creature is still there. 

When Donna finds me and flips out, ""who are you? Why are you in my house?"" I try to explain what happens, but I just freak her out. 

She gives me an old pair of her shoes, and I leave. I have no idea where I am, there are two dogs outside. One is super friendly, the other is menacing and barking like crazy. 

I have to go past the menacing dog to get to where I thought was home, I try to avoid it, but it's chain was longer than I thought and it tried to bite me. 

I avoided getting bit and ran ahead, something felt off. So I grabbed my phone, and I was going to text my fiance and ask him to pick me up.

Until I seen the date, it was something like ""May 15th, 2014"" don't remember the exact date, but I freaked out. My first reaction was, what happened to my fiance? I just had a baby, so I knew now that she didn't exist anymore. That made me really sad to think about. 

I tried opening my phone, but it was locked, and I couldn't figure out the password. 

So I started having an anxiety attack, afraid of what was going to happen. Technically I had a new start, but it wasn't something I wanted. 

I started crying, thinking about if me and my fiance would even get together again. I told myself I'll find him, and I'll try to spark a relationship. It also crossed my mind, ""maybe he remembers me too?"" Maybe we just have a bond that can beat time. 

Then I thought about my daughter, and that those nine months just faded away. It made me even more sad, she made me so happy. 

I'm just walking at this point. The sidewalk was shitty, and there was an old shitty abandoned factory to my left. A train track to my right. 

At that moment I just thought, ""I don't want to start all over, I'm happy with the family I already have."" 

And then I woke up, realized it was all just a dreamed. It was instant relief, I already appreciated the life I have, it just made me appreciate my life even more. 

Not sure exactly what the deeper meaning is though, I have no idea what my brain was doing. ",new,"I died, and went back in time.",1.0

I remember everything in my room being very detailed but really dark. I could only see the figure because of the street lights peering through my windows. A couple nights later the figure was standing in the middle of my room. The next night it was standing right next to my bed, Its body was up against my bed looking down on me. I couldn't move. That same night but at a different time, it had gone inside of me. I remember immediately waking up but not being able to move, speak, or yell. Sleep paralysis I assume. 

Last night was the worst of them all. I remember going down into my living room. There was water up to my waist and dead children floating in the water. A women, who I had presumed to be dead as well, quickly looked up and stared into my eyes. Then I was suddenly outside my house. I tried to walk inside but I stopped at the door. My body started bending in ways I couldn't even imagine. Kind of like I had been possessed. Actually, almost exactly how you would expect someone being possessed would move.  By force my face kept slamming into the pavement. When I woke up I could very vividly remember the pain I had felt.

(IRL, I just got back from a vacation to Montana with my sister). We had a great time, I only remember eating at a restaurant together before we headed to the airport. At the airport, we got through security before I realized I forgot to bring some of my bags through. I went back for the bags and got sexually assaulted by my IRL boyfriend’s professor on the way??? When I got back to security, I told the airport staff about my bags and then I had to sit in a room with glass walls for hours waiting for someone to bring them to me. The room was kinda like box seating in a huge arena setting with like 60 stories. But the area below was concrete, it felt like a prison, and there were people putting on some kind of show for us while we waited. There was a balcony outside of the room that we could watch from. I sat in the room instead and ate a TON of bananas??? My family couldn’t see or contact me during that time so I figured they took the flight without me. Eventually they broke into the arena and found me, brought me my cat, I realized that somehow I had my bags all along, and we tried to leave. We weren’t able to get out tho so instead we stayed and watched the show that was being performed in the arena. While we were watching, people from the other box seat balconies started falling. We assumed it was a mass suicide and started freaking out. But I noticed a few mins later that the floors of some of the balconies were tilted down and that that was how people were falling. I grabbed onto the wall of our balcony (we weren’t able to go into the room for some reason) and realized that someone IN OUR BOX was controlling it. And that it was my IRL childhood best friend’s mom. She realized that I figured it out and tilted our box so we’d all fall, but my sisters boyfriend killed her and we broke back into the room. At this point, my cat was sick or injured or something so I took her to a DIFFERENT IRL childhood friend’s mom, who also happened to be at this weird airport arena setting. She treated my cat and everything was fine, until my cat turned bright purple and I realized that she forgot to stop drawing my cat’s blood. My cat lost a lot of blood and almost died. For that reason, I refused to pay my friend’s mom for the treatment. My mom stepped in and yelled at friend’s mom for trying to make me pay her. Friend’s mom freaked out and stormed off, returning a few mins later with a knife and blood already on her. Her entire vet staff showed up out of nowhere to help her defeat us. She tried to kill my cat and me, so we went back to our box seat room and told the others (who I never noticed were there before in the dream, but they ended up being my friends from college).

0.0,ansq3c,1.0,1.0,"Here is a sort of 'rule' I've noticed to dreams, in general.

""When something happens in real life by accident, your dreams won't accept that and show that it happened because SOMEONE WANTED IT THAT WAY"".

And they usually put some big plot behind it.

For example in real life I got some infection in my finger (only 2mm in size). It didn't heal properly after I pulled it out. It left a scar for a few a months. My dreams however showed it as some sort of demonic turtle who just attacked me and was biting my finger.

Another time, I burnt my hand by accident on a hotplate (again only 1cm burn no big deal). My dreams however, showed a dark dungeon room, with two monsters in it wearing armour, one of them decided to jump into a frying pan and be burnt alive! Describing how his body was being burnt and he can feel his eyes going blind (as if it's fun) and finishing off saying ""It's the style of the century!!!""

lol. I guess?

I've seen many dreams here on this forum too saying the same thing. [https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ansedu/one\_of\_the\_weirdest\_dreams\_ive\_ever\_had\_beaten/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ansedu/one_of_the_weirdest_dreams_ive_ever_had_beaten/) this one, some woman is losing all her children in the dream but it turns out a doctor was secretly killing her children.

See? ""There's no such thing as infertility, an evil doctor is doing it to you!""

...

Another time in real life, I broke one of my house-plants by accident (about 30cm tall) and it needed urgent ""plant surgery"" to save it. But in my dream I saw that actually the house-plant was a CAT, and it liked being near me so much that it actually sat underneath me by accident, and I'd sat on it and broke it's leg :(

Again... well the dream is saying I didn't break my house-plant by accident. It was almost saying it was the cat (plant's) fault for being near me too much despite it being obviously dangerous.

...

So what's the point of this? Well! Here's the point.

If dreams show really cool stuff in a fun way, that makes sense and is meaningful... and they always seem to be run by the rule of ""nothing bad happens by accident, it's because someone chose for it to be that way"" (Even if they didn't want it to be so bad but were WARNED and didn't listen, its still a choice).

Well... what about writing real-life stories like that? I mean, for a fiction-writer. Or someone writing plots for computer-games. Or films even. That ""things don't just happen by accident"".

...

There's no disease that happens by accident. No ""birth defects"" that ""just happen by accident"". Or even ""you don't start out with a disadvantage in life by accident"", from abusive parents or bullies at school. There could be some reason they are doing this, some plot behind it to try to stop you, or perhaps you chose to suffer, either way SOMEONE chose for it.

That's all.

Maybe it would help write more fun and deeper plot-lines for stories in general?

Some people might even believe it is true, for example many ""myths"" had it that ""even bad things like winter don't happen by accident, they happen because someone (some powerful demi-god) made it that way because they were angry about something...""

I think ""the gods caused winter cos of arguments"" is a kind of bad myth to be honest, because we orbit the sun and stuff and that's why we have winter. But still... it makes for an interesting story. I'm sure better stories could be made that also fit with physics.

Considering how easily people can just ""dream up"" really deep and powerful plotlines to explain all sorts of things, far more complicated than ""winter""... I'm sure someone could ""dream up"" a better dream explanation than ""some gods being angry""... or else why would they get angry every year at the same time? its stupid. its a physics based event. But that doesn't mean a dream would interpret it that way.",new,"Interesting pattern about how we dream, (could lead to more interesting stories)?",1.0

The place we moved to was weird. It was like we had to pass through five other rooms to get to our room/apartment. It was small and depressing, and the door basically had no locks or anything, it was literally moving into a room of a house (although it was more of a hotel if I recall correctly) and the door just didn’t have a proper lock. 

Although it was dark and depressing inside, there was a single window with a beautiful view of a bright beach, and the shore curved like a crescent moon and the water was a bright blue. My mom tried to cheer me up by pointing out how beautiful the view was, but I still missed the view of my city’s skyscrapers. The beach was beautiful, of course, but I just felt so out of place and desperate there.

In the dream I was very worried because my dick is small, and I said to myself that how was I gonna make her happy with a small dick. I was adding a lot of emphasis on the size of my dick. I saw past it and ended up marrying her. I was married to her for about 4 years when she got pregnant with our first child, and guess what? It died. So I obviously remembered about the other three she had lost and I started to investigate and dig deep into her life. Maybe she was cursed? Maybe, someone she knew was making her lose her children? Later in the dream I found out that it was her doctor (some fucker named Pietro who looked exactly like Albert Einstein) from all her life the one who gave her pills saying they were for a sickness she had when in fact made her lose her children. Turns out the guy raped her when she was 15 and got her pregnant, and made her kill her fetus so he wouldn't get discovered. He found some sort of sick enjoyment out of this and from that moment onwards every time one of his patients (including my fake wife) got pregnant he would kill their child.

• Went to watch a movie with this close friend  (but somehow she morphed into someone else now?? I realize this after waking up) We were watching the movie in a large room with a projector sitting on plastic chairs, close to us were people from my class including this guy I have been into on and off for three years.

Then I was eating some sort of rock candy from a bowl, **that is the disgusting event #1** because I struggle with binge eating and I ate so much of it that by the time I stopped I felt really gross, not just psychologically but physically.

• I had been cutting some fruit on marble and forgot to clean it up, making a huge mess in the morning.

Then I threw it onto the ground and stepped on it, it bled a lot (as in human blood) and to top it off the cleaning lady told me to move its corpse. Thankfully I woke up before having to touch it.

The first happened three years ago, I had stayed up until 6 am and from 6-6:15 when I laid down to sleep I went into this foggy state. In this state I got up out of bed and there was a man laying on my couch, I couldn't see his physical features as he was just all an all black figure but he had an energy about him that led me to feel like I knew him. He couldn't talk to me, I just know I was panicking because he wasn't supposed to be in my house because my parents were going to wake up soon. I was telling him this and looking up the stairs where my door was cracked just as how I had left it (I slept in the basement). Eventually the man got in my bed and I followed suit, and then came out of the foggy state and realized it had only been 15 minutes. So I thought that was weird.

Then last night I had another similar experience that was just a bit more disorienting. It was 4am and I had just laid my baby down and got into bed to go back to sleep. All of a sudden it was like I got back out of bed to use the bathroom, and for some reason I was confused and sat outside the bathroom when I finished. I was feeling really disoriented and decided to go climb back in bed and when I was walking to and getting in my bed the whole room was just spinning, I couldn't get a grip and felt very uneasy and just got back in bed. I continued on sleeping but that was the start of it before I started dreaming like normal dreams. 

It was very odd and I haven't felt like that in so long that I just wanted to share. Has anyone else had these kind of experiences? The more out of body in the present moment rather than in dream Land? I never did see my own body. But it just feels so real and not like the usual dreams I have, which are extremely vivid.

Her name is Brianna, and she’s very pretty and very quirky. She’s had a couple of boyfriends, she was kinda popular and she was very funny.

She lived here for a while and she’s very kind (might I add) and she’s just smart in every way, but I just don’t like her in that way. I liked other girls at the time.

Here’s where the dream starts, we were I would say like maybe 7 or 8 years old just talking to each other and this is where the dream gets a little bit loose but I remember I did something and we had liked one another and I asked her “Do you wanna date?”

She replied with “Yes” and we never did date. The future came and I was going to ask her, but I didn’t have the balls. I was gonna say something like “Hey you remember that time when you say you’d wanna date? Yeah... about that...” or something corny like that.

What could this dream possibly mean? I’m so confused...

I was never behind or unprepared, besides, I thrived on the stress and pressure of exams and deadlines. Now that I'm an adult, I don't think back to my education much during my waking life.

Yet, very frequently throughout my adult life, I have recurring dreams about having to go back to some point in my education (school, college or university) and attend classes, complete assignments, re-sit exams, sometimes re-do entire qualifications with a class of students much younger than me. 

These dreams always involve me having missed a lot of classes, being really stressed and overwhelmed as I realise I'd completely forgotten I was supposed to be studying at all! And having a sudden realisation that I'd been avoiding/ignoring all this work and realising how hopelessly behind I am.

0.0,asewza,0.0,7.0,"It started off as a regular dream, me and my friend went to a music concert, until I spotted an elevator. This elevator was to go to the bar on the top floor, which apparently had a great view of the concert. On my way up, the biggest cockroach I've ever seen scuttled onto my foot. I screamed and kicked it off. It became paralysed for a moment when it hit the wall, so I decided to stomp on it to make sure it didn't frighten me again. I lifted my shoe and expected to see cockroach parts mushed all over the bottom of it, but there was nothing there. I looked back down at the cockroach and its body was crusting over. I stood in the opposite corner of the elevator, to try and get as far away as possible from that monstrosity. Then, it's body started to tear in half and four, still quite big cockroaches crawled out of it and up the walls.

I woke in a sweat, the only reason being that I hate cockroaches. But the second dream that night is where it got worst.

I was watching a youtube video, when it abruptly changed. There were some blue curtains on the screen with a large green box over it with the words 'finding dory' (I actually have no idea why it was that movie, it doesn't fit with the dream at all). Suddenly, all the speakers in my house turned on, and the dealing noise of a shotgun loading rung through the house. Thank goodness there were no police nor family members at my house. The second part of the video opened up all of these files on my mac, they were all just basically spam. I tried to turn off my computer, yet when I held the power button, it wouldn't turn off. I looked at my keyboard and my figure had moved to the next key along. I tried again and it kept happening. I eventually managed to force quit all the files. After I had located them, I instantly deleted them. Later that afternoon, I got an email from an unknown contact. It read 'If you are to share what happened to you today, I'm afraid you won't see the light of  tomorrow.' I thought nothing of this morning, and told my mum. Then I woke up.

Dreams, like these two, really have an impact on my sleeping schedule. For example, I'm currently writing this at 4am, which isn't good as I have school today.

For instance I was horrified to be told they were going to take two kidneys from me.  When I questioned this, the female nurse told me some people have three so I might still have one left afterwards.  They were going to take most of my other organs too, basically empty me out.  I didn't want to go through with it after all and decided to withdraw consent.  The male doctor wanted a cheque from me for something (to get him to agree to cancel the donation maybe?) but I told him I haven't had a cheque book in years.  He was adamant he would only accept a cheque.

I left, and I was walking down some lanes and unexpectedly found myself in a different town at a field that contained my mother's pet horses.  I was surprised that this town was so close to the place where I had been.  A girl came along who supposedly rides the horses sometimes.  I decided to get a taxi back the way I had come even though it was a short walk.  The taxi arrived, I got in and he asked for directions as he didn't usually go that way.  He told me the fare would be at least £500.  I was surprised that it was so steep.  We drove up the lane and came to a stately home.

i’ve experienced reoccurring dreams in the past but never this prominent. i am not joking when i say i’ve had pretty much the same dream every night for over 2 months now. should i be concerned? i have kind of a bad habit of eating sour candy before i go to bed, maybe it’s got something to do with the candy’s chemical properties? do i just need to go to a music festival???",hot,reoccurring dreams for literally months??,5.0

""Tell us!"" They insisted. 

I take a deep breath and explain, ""I can fly because this is a dream. You aren't real, and when I wake up you will cease to exist""

My daughter, eight years old, told me about this crazy dream she had last night. I felt lightheaded as she gave me more and more details; it's the same recurring dream I've been having my entire life. 

The dream itself is pretty innocuous, nothing too weird. In the dream I have the ability to float for short amounts of time, and it always starts in the kitchen of my grandmother's house. I walk over to her hallway that leads to the living room, and do the little hop that gets me floating. Then I just float up and down the hallway for awhile. 

My daughter described all of that to me in detail, starting in the kitchen and floating up and down the hallway. She demonstrated the weird little hopping move that gets the floating started in the dream. 

I guess I just wanted to see what other people had to say about this. I'm floored because it's so specific and she had the EXACT same dream, not just similar. 

Reddit take the wheel, I'm a little unnerved.

She was a shorter girl with brownish-blonde hair and a very pretty face that I can still picture in my head. It's weird because I also remember some super particular details about her life and character, since my dream consisted of me getting to know her and falling in love with her. She was 2 years older than me, and she had an incredibly adventurous-like personality. I remember at first thinking we would never be more than friends because of her being older and more confident than me, yet to my surprise she ended up showing interest in me regardless (which made me incredibly happy). Her father had passed away, but she was very close with her mother who had founded this online education program sort of thing. She was in the process of completing her mom's program, and had a job arranged for her to work at The Guardian as a political analyst when she was done (so fucking random but I remember this clearly). Anyways that's all I remember backstory wise, the rest of the dream consisted of me going places with her, meeting her friends and family, and ultimately developing mutual feelings for each other. I woke up sad that the dream was over, because I felt not only attached to this girl, but that I actually knew her and loved her as a real human being. But in the end she was just imaginary...

Has anyone ever had a dream like this?

This has never happened to me before, so I wanted to share and see if anyone else has experienced something similar

I always respect her wishes. I look away and busy myself with work while she unlocks whatever I need. 

Today, I had a dream where I was holding her phone and decided to unlock it. The first numbers which popped into mind were 3551 \*her password has since changed LOL\*, I typed it in and BAM! Unlocked. It was a weird and short dream, but as I was getting up for work I thought it'd be funny to try it out. And what do you know...it unlocked. I thought I was still dreaming, it was INSANE! 

I don't know why those numbers stuck out to me, perhaps my subconscious has picked up on something that I wasn't aware of? Or maybe my brain is a sleeping-hacker? HAHA. But in all seriousness, I thought that was pretty cool...now to dream up some lotto numbers and win big!

0.0,a3eo1x,89.0,163.0,"This is a weird lucid dream I just woke up from 20 min ago from taking a nap.  I’ll try to summarize the whole dream as short as I remember most details.

I was in this 2 story house on some vacation.  My family and some other people were there.  I had no idea who they were.  I was asking my mom who some them were and realized just then and said omg I’m dreaming.  I just decide to take things through my own hand.  Around that moment, I suddenly appear in another dream talking to this girl named Annie Who was wearing something on her head.  I can’t really describe what she was wearing exactly, but it encased her whole head with a rubber seal at her neck.  I don’t know why she was wearing it, and I didn’t bother to ask.  Well, we are looking for the School librarian in this dream.  I have no idea why, but we were, and I decided to go along with it and see where my dream leads me rather than doing my own thing.

We go walking outside towards the school, and I’m conversing with Annie.  Nearing the front doors, I end up opening up to Annie and saying that she is not real, that I am dreaming and that she is just a person i am projecting in my dream.  What followed was surreal.  She started to cry and wanting to deny it saying this can’t be true.  She was crying so much unrealistically that her tears started to fill up the helmet or whatever the hell she was wearing.  I tried to calm her and get her to stop crying by lying to her and say that she may actually be real.  So I repeatedly asked her what her full name was and maybe I’ll find you.  Her mask filled up and she passed out.  I caught her and gently laid her on the ground.  I pulled off the helmet, and shook her waking her up.  Her eyes were opening partially and then she started what seemed like convulsing while more and more tears started coming out, but liquid was coming out of her mouth nose and ears.  Almost seemed like acidic liquid, but it basically ate her body away.

I was shocked as to what happened, but I decided to continued on the quest to find this librarian.  I walked in and approached this first door I see.  Dogs through this glass window barked and scared the crap out of me, but the dogs looked hairless and evil.  A woman answered the door and said that I’m looking for the librarian.  She said look outside.  There are two blue houses and he is in the house on the right.  I look outside, I see it and the dream ends.

———————

I thought it was weird that Annie seemed like she was erased out of my dream in a horrific way because I simply told her that she was not real.  Then the dogs in the room seemed like foreshadowing or an omen for telling that girl Annie, because they did not look like any normal animal.  Then the woman guiding me outside the school seemed like I was going to be taking a different turn in this dream rather than finding the librarian.

I woke up, and I’m not really shocked, tired, confused or groggy.  Feel free to share any thoughts, ideas or questions as to what the hell happened.

This time, for whatever reason, I was feeling inquisitive - I wanted to know where I was and how this dream stuff works, so I asked…


[This is a dialogue between me and one of the girls, I’ll call her Britt]


Me: “Am I dreaming?

Britt: “Yes, you are.”


 [At this point I look into her eyes, because in my past experience in dreams eyes always look fake. They looked as real as can be. This was happening as we got in a truck to go to their house.]


Me: “Are you a part of my dream; you seem so real!”

Britt: “No, silly. You are a part of our world. I am as real as you are.”


[At this point we get to their house and go inside where we sit around a circle table littered with sticky notes and cards, and the tv is on. I have to keep looking at my hands to prevent waking up.]


Me: “So what is this place?”

Britt: “This is our home.”

Me: “ No, I meant this dream, where is it taking place. Is this another world?”

Britt: “No, we are not of the universe.”

Me: “Well then…where? Is this like a different dimension?”

Britt: “You could call it that. This place is an infinite space without matter. There are only thoughts here, only imagination. We don’t have bodies to weigh us down, we are free flowing energy. 

Me: “So, why does everything look so normal here? I mean you all look human like me.”

Britt: “That’s because your thoughts make what you see. Your thoughts form the energy into imagery you can understand. Everything around you is energy, not matter. Your material brain isn’t meant to understand this. Your kind is so used to everything having purpose and being understood, it is hard for you to comprehend a place like this.

Me: “Wow, I’ve been waiting to learn this stuff my whole life. I wish I could tell the world, but no one would believe me…”

Britt: “Don’t worry about convincing others, they will all figure it out in time.”

[Now I look over at the TV, it looks like a commercial. This one is different than anything I have ever seen though. The background picture is just colorful waves and there’s a strange writing scrolling up the screen - image at the bottom]

[It's normal for me to see English alphabet letters in my dreams, even if distorted or hard to read, but I had never seen anything like those symbols in dreams or while awake]


Me: “What is that on the screen, those symbols?!”

Britt: “Those are words…”

Me: “ I see that but what language is that, is it yours?”

Britt: “No, it’s yours.”

Me: “I don’t recognize it. I want to keep a sample of this, write something down so I can memorize it. I’ll write something for you too. Do you have paper?


[At this point the three girls are silent as I search through the stuff on the table for unused stickynotes. I finally find some and tear off two of them, but as soon as I reach out to hand one to Britt I suddenly wake up without warning. ]



[Here's a link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1BED9lp2GhrcmwwVEJ3VWdSUmc) to what I drew doing my best to remember the symbols on the screen. The ones I drew **are not** the exact symbols I saw, I couldn't remember the exact ones I saw, but it represents the style of the writing and the parts of letters that I did remember.

0.0,962ey6,69.0,135.0,"Its about a young girl and I've had 2 dreams of her. The weird thing is.. she appeared in my real life just 1 year ago. I dreamed of her in 2004 and 2016. It's a little girl and she said in those dreams: *""If you want me in your life, you have to put this piece of rock in the center (this was in 2004)""*. One year later I moved to the other side of the country, into a town that is known for having big pre-historic boulders. Basically I started to center my new life around this town, known for it's rocks.... So I completed that task without even knowing it. 

In the 2016 one she said in a dream that if I want to meet her in my life, I had to call her name and say loudly that I want to meet her. So I did. In 2017 I moved to another part of the town. Not long after that I saw her playing on the street, just in front of my house. I was stunned, she looked exactly like that girl from the dreams. Shes my neighbor. And when she told me her name, I couldn't breath. 

Another weird thing is, She's only 7 years old and she knows stuff about me she cant possibly know because I haven't told her anything about myself. Today, out of the blue, she said to me: *""I will never leave you""*. She somehow knows that I've always been afraid of people leaving me (I've developed an attachment disorder in my youth because I was taken away from my parents and moved a lot between new parents / (foster)homes). I asked her to repeat because I couldn't believe my ears. She repeated. When I asked her why she said something like that, she answered that she just had *that* feeling she had to say it.

This dream and the appearing of her in my real life makes me believe that there is more between heaven and earth.

Edit after reading some comments :

- to be clear, I didn't change my life for her. I just moved because I needed a house to life in and I had a bigger chance in this town to find that. In 2017 I moved from a 2 room apartment to a 3 room family house. So you understand that I wanted to live in bigger house. 

- Also, I have no ""feelings"" for this girl that should worry you. I'm not like that. Disgusting!

I was woken up by the overwhelming sense of grief and despair of losing my girlfriend. The dream involved me hearing of her death, and it continued until the sadness I felt had snowballed so much that I physically felt sadness throughout my whole body. This happened a little after midnight, and I lay awake for hours unable to sleep afterwards.

My girlfriend was sleeping beside me in the same bed, and for 4 to 5 hours I fought off the urge to wake her up (she was up early for work and I didn't want to ruin her sleep) to talk to her for some comfort after feeling such sadness at the thought of losing her.

At around 5am my girlfriend woke up in a panic. She was crying and breathing very heavily. I asked her what was wrong, she seemed reluctant to answer, but after I asked again twice she told me that she had a dream that I had died. 

I comforted her as she was very upset. I then filled her in on what had happened in my dream. She was obviously shocked to hear I had had the same dream a few hours previously.

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar to this?

My family and I were exploring a small tourist-y island somewhere out at sea when all of the sudden alarms started going off. North Korea was firing nukes to Japan and we had to get to safety. Luckily all places in Japan were well prepared for this and we could all hide in underground tunnels that were well built and would lead us to an airport far far away. We could hear explosions happen on the surface above us and people were scared and crying. Everyone was spooked and nobody knew what to do.

Fast forward a bit and I’ve somehow made it back to the Netherlands (where I live). It is nighttime and I meet with close friends who are glad I’m alright. We talk about what’s going on in the world when suddenly while we’re just out on the street we see another nuke coming pretty much straight for us. For a few seconds everyone is just staring at it. Why would our tiny country get attacked? We all start running but after a few seconds we all knew we were done for.

Time seems to be slowing down for us as we suddenly see the biggest, brightest light growing and growing only a few hundred meters away from us. I heard one of my friends scream something but couldn’t make any sense of it because of the explosion. I remember saying “I love you guys” before being engulfed in this light. I think i flipped it off before it happened? Not quite sure...anyway.

I see and feel my body just melting away and becoming nothing as time just slows down even more. All i see is white which then slowly turns to black. All sound and thought dissapears until there is literally nothing but dark.

And then, and I swear I dreamt this, it brings me to a character creation screen. Where I try to just make myself again but then am quickly told that no I can not remake myself. I can however, since I’ve been a good person, make it so that my child will resemble the now dead me.

So I was in an Apocalypse and people were running. A police officer took me and was dragging me to somewhere. I realized that he had a grenade on him and I stole it. I pulled the pin and waited. The grenade exploded and I died.

Next thing I know, my body was dead but I was still concous. I was looking in a 3rd person perspective at myself lying on the floor. And just watching myself decay. 

Suddenly everything went black. Like the 'you died"" part in a video game, I was given 2 options. I was given ""accept my death"" or ""revive myself"". For some random reason, my mind choose the 2nd reason, which was to revive myself.

Suddenly my concouness when into my body and I woke up (In the dream). Everything reversed and I wasn't in the Apocalypse. 

It was just so weird. I don't remember anything after that.

0.0,9v1sb7,20.0,115.0,"I just had the most crazy dream ever and it’s perfect for the plot of a movie. The dream started off weird, like someone had skipped an hour into a dvd. I was already at the climax.

Me and a friend of mine (lets call him joe) somehow ended up in a COMPLETELY different universe, seemingly stuck in a dystopian earth. 

The dream begins with us hiding behind a bush in a lawn, hiding from something. We seem to be in a residential area just outside of a large city, whose menacing skyscrapers could be seen from where we were.

Every material, including the distant skyscrapers, was blocky and various shades of grey. There is barbed wire fences EVERYWHERE except the sidewalks and street. The only evidence of life was the grey, lego-like houses, and the occasional peek from behind the curtains. Trees were scarce, grass even more so.

Joe says something along the lines of “its safe to go out now.” I ask where the hell are we, to which he replied “I don’t know.” We start walking down the barren street, and i think about how to get back to our reality. Abruptly, i sense something approaching us from down the street, and think to myself “run!”

Here’s where it gets a little crazy. I never see the antagonists physical appearance. It’s just a feeling, like i can tell that ITS there. The fucked up part is, they’re not invisible. They’re just REALLY hard to focus on, like when you see them your eyesight degrades exponentially. I see them once, later in the story. For the rest of this post, I’ll just call them the antagonists.

Without saying a word, me n joe sprint to the side, my vision blurry from viewing the antagonist. There was a building that looked identical to a jail, Alcatraz on land to be exact. We sprint in without a second thought.

With dream physics, we are pretty much instantly in one of the hallways within the jail, armed with ray guns. There is no source of light, and it looked tech-y. For sake of visualizing how it looked, twas’ very similar to the setting that the video game SCP containment breach was set in.

There are multiple doors on each side of the hallway, and we enter one. Inside is a classroom. Full of kids of various ages, mostly late teens or little kids it seems. They are all wearing something akin to bodysuits. In the room itself were multiple antagonists. With my vision blurred and more dream physics, me and joe put them down. The kids all jump up, and I prepared to find the answer to the age old question- “how many 5th graders can you take on at once?”

The kids erupt in applause and happiness, thanking us. We ask the kids about life, and boy does it fucking suck. They have no freedom, uniforms, and no choice in life. We learn we are in their version of high school. We decide to destroy their high school and set them free.

Dream physics strike again, and i reach in my hoodie pocket to discover. i am carrying an atomic bomb the size of a watermelon around. In.my. pocket. Thanks to my video game knowledge, i knew i had to put that at the core of the high school and get out. 

We go class room to class room, clearing out anyone that tried to kill us. Some students rooted for us, or fought us. One student claimed he needed our help, and led us into a trap. We were surrounded by the antagonists, and next thing i know we were being held down.All of a sudden, panic breaks thru our captors, and all of them eventually hit the floor. I felt some one freeing us. I stood, and looked at my liberator.

HO.
LY.
SHIT.

She was an absolutely beautiful woman who i can’t tell if I’ve seen her before. curly hair, amazing body, light brown eyes. Beautiful barely describes her, and perfection is a mediocre attempt at describing her. I felt more than a physical attraction. My brain was telling me “this is your soulmate. This is her.”

Without a second though, she says “follow me!” And me and joe do without question.

She put down any antagonists we came across with so much ease and grace, never hesitating. She must’ve had the ability to see them.

We plant the bomb and get outside, standing atop the roof. We can see helicopters, tanks, and apcs heading our way from ALL directions. Joe pulls out this weird device (a portal), throws it in the air and says “lets go home”. I was too busy watching the woman, with her curls blowing with the wind, her eyes fixed on the incoming force. 
I remember this part word for word.

Me: “please... come with us! We have freedom, and better lives! You can be so happy.”

Her: “....” 

Joe: “come on, we have to go NOW!”

Me: “please... come with me.”

Her: “... I can’t. This is the only life I’ve ever known. I just can’t run away from my reality like that.” She looks at me and tells me “please, go live your life in your universe. Just be happy.”

The structure is rumbling and collapsing. Joe grabs my hand and jumps into the portal above our heads. The last thing i saw was fire from the blast of the bomb. I woke up, and started tearing up immediately. I felt like shit.

We were renting a house at the time, but looked at one bedroom apartments that were cheaper. We found one and put a deposit on it. We were set to give our landlord a 30 day notice the following day.

That night, my sleep was greatly disturbed. I was dreaming that we had moved into the apartment we'd put the deposit on. In my dream, we hadn't lived there long when our doorbell rang. My husband went to open the door. I heard a gunshot and ran to find my husband bleeding out on the floor.

The dream was so real that I awoke and grabbed the phone beside my bed and dialed 911 in real life! Thankfully, after hearing one ring, I realized that I was awake and the whole ordeal had been a nightmare, and hung up the phone. 

I dressed quickly because I felt that the police would probably come to our house since I was certain that our number and address had been registered on their end before I hung up.  Luckily, no one ever called back or showed up at our house.

But, because of this dream, I told my husband that we shouldn't move into that apartment. We found a different apartment and moved there instead. And, it turned out to be the right thing to do because not too long after, we were watching our local news. There had been a shooting in the apartment parking lot of the one I had the dream about. A resident had been shot dead as he was going to his car. There was no rhyme or reason to it and the shooter was never found. 

I feel that my vivid dream saved my husband or perhaps myself  from being shot and killed. It was one of the freakiest things I've ever experienced.",top,My creepy dream that caused me to dial 911. X-Post,111.0
0.0,abu8yp,24.0,112.0,"I've told my friends about this dream and their reactions were a mix of concerned, horrified and baffled. I really want to share this dream I had because it haunted me for weeks and I feel I'm owed some actual explanation.

This dream was incredibly vivid - - when I woke up I thought briefly this had actually happen. I will speak generally and omit details for brevity but feel free to ask for specific information.

I don't know if any of you know Onision but he is somewhat of infamous YouTuber. I don't follow him or the drama around him so I have no idea why I would have a dream about him. 

The dream starts off with me and my mother driving. My mother is the driver and I am sitting in the back for whatever reason. We have no destination if I recall. We were driving across massive deserts that didn't seem to end. There wasnt anything for what felt like hours. Until we come across a parking lot.

My mom slows down the car to a stop as we see a couple is stranded due to their car being visibly in disrepair. I recognize that the couple is Onision and his spouse. This actually scares me - - I turn and tell my mother we should avoid them and leave them here. My mom disagrees with me and offers them a drive from across the parking lot. At this point Onision does not speak and neither does his spouse. 

They just get in the car. 

Onision sits next to me and his spouse sits in the passenger seat, next to my mother. I am extremely uncomfortable with this and as we drive again I put great effort to avoid eye contact with Onision. But I can feel this weird energy exuding from him next to me. I know he's there. 

Now for several hours, Onision says nothing. I found this weird but it eventually made me feel calm as I stared out at the window. I can vividly remember watching the shadow of the car and the landscape shift the further we went. 

The Onision began to insult my family with no prompt given. I cannot recall what he says here so don't ask me, but trust me when I say it must have been offensive or deeply personal as it made both me and my mother cry. What I'm about to say is going to come across as though it happened a lot faster than it actually did but.

I reacted by pushing both Onision and his spouse out of the moving car. I somehow moved from the back seat to the passenger seat to push Onision's spouse out of the car even though they did nothing wrong? I don't know. Neither of them put up a fight. Next moment, my mom is holding me as we both sob. I tell her how wrong she was for offering Onision help and she agrees with me, and it is all very, very dramatic. 

Now. Flash forward a year into the future. 

My old high school asks for me to give a motivational speech at one of their assemblies. For some fucking reason I decided to talk about my encounter with Onision. 

To keep it brief, it did not go well.

The audience was either bored or outraged by my speech. Both made sense because for some reason I decided to add false details to the story that made it more longer and extravagant than it needed to be. 

My reputation was tarnished by this and I was incredibly humiliated. 

Fast forward ANOTHER year. 

I am now homeless. I know, I know. But I remember very vividly living in an alleyway in a cardboard box. I was very skinny and my hair was oily and I stank of sweat and blood. I don't know how my speech about Onision ruined my life to this extreme, but it did. I was very cold and very afraid. 

 One day, a kind stranger offered me a dollar. I decided to go to McDonald's and buy myself a burger. I'm very embarrassed because of my tattered clothes and everyone in the restaurant recognizes me from my speech. I go up to the register and ask for a kids burger very timidly. 

When I look up, it is Onision. He is working at McDonald's now. He doesn't recognize me as the girl that pushed him out of a moving car two years prior and politely asks me if I want anything else. 

Then I wake up. 

For several hours after the dream I couldn't stop thinking about it and what it could mean. For days and then weeks it would randomly pop in my head. It's become a joke among my friends now because of how ridiculous it is but I really want answers.

A couple years ago, I broke things off with my fiance. He was my best friend. It surprised me how his chest could contain a heart so big and so warm. You know how some people are described as so kind, that they would give the shirt off of their back to someone in need? He actually did exactly that, for a complete stranger. I loved him. He was a silly, goofy guy that could make me laugh so hard my stomach would hurt. He'd leave me little love notes to find around the house, make me coffee every morning. We made unforgettable memories together. 

But he was a heroin addict. His mind was filled with turmoil. He fought daily, unseen battles. He'd been to rehab, multiple times, as well as counselling and psychiatric hospitals. I know how hard he tried to get better, how much he struggled. If you have a loved one who's been through it, you know the heartache. I stuck by him, when he went to jail for stealing. And again, when he went back for violating probation. When he relapsed and became comatose, I was there when he woke up. I helped dress him and pushed his wheelchair until he could walk again. But eventually, I left. I was scared. He wanted to keep in touch, to be friends, but I pushed him away and went NC.

The dreams started last March, the month that he died. Every other night, but sometimes every night. They happen even now. We weren't Facebook friends, but I'd regularly check his page to read his daily, public inspirational/motivational quotes. But they stopped. After a while of silence, I tried to reach out. In late May, his parents contacted me and I learned the truth. 

My dreams about him are frequent, and vivid. Sometimes they are good dreams. I'll run into him and find out he never died, or he came back to life. He will be concerned about me, or we will just be hanging out like we used to. They feel so real. Sometimes he seems mad at me, I find out he faked his death out of spite for me, to hurt me. But even in those dreams, I feel relieved that he is alive. No matter what though, every day is the same. I wake up, and for a split second, I believe he's alive and I still have a chance to reach out to him. 

For a moment, I forget that he is gone. Then I remember, and my heart hurts. ",top,My ex-fiance regularly appears in my dreams. He died last march.,108.0

So for some reason I’m living in New York and there’s a massive fire that’s destroying all of the city(Never been to New York irl). There are these towers that people are supposed to evacuate too. So everyone in the city is rushing trying to get to the tower. 

For some reason i was responsible for making sure a bunch of kids got there safely and we have to cross this small swinging bridge hundreds of feet off the ground. I’m not scared of heights so it wasn’t a problem for me, but I remember all the kids being scared. We finally start crossing. 

As we get to the evacuation tower one of my students slipped. She was panicking and started shaking the bridge. I went to help her but she was struggling so bad that she tipped us both over. Her hands are wrapped around my neck while I’m trying to hold on and pull us back onto the bridge. The door was so close. All the kids were crying and scared. I’m trying to calm the screaming girl on my back while we still hang over the edge. 

I eventually am able to pull us both up. As we start I crawl into the door with the girl on my back I let her down and begin to make sure all the other kids are ok. Once all the kids are there I just break down. My heart was pounding from the relief of the situation. I remember crying in the dream. When I woke up I was having that same reaction. I woke up in a sweat, heart pounding, tears running down my eyes. 

I work as a teacher irl. With a lot of little kids. I’m pretty sure that has something to do with it. I’m not sure what I came to this reddit for. It just felt appropriate that I share it.

So basically I was playing a weird version of Kingdom Hearts (I think?). I was Xigbar and I was exploring the caves of what I assume was Hollow Bastion or something. But there weren't any monsters at all, which I found weird. Eventually I got to the first savepoint which was a clean double bed with a heavenly spotlight over it. A text box appeared and warned me that this savepoint was free, but that I would have to earn the right to save at other points. I found it odd, but I just kinda brushed it off and kept exploring further.  


I woke up not long afterwards from my alarm to get ready for school, but I was still not fully awake and I just thought ""oh wait, I forgot to save my progress!"" so I went straight back to sleep and picked up where I left off. I quickly found a savepoint, but I forgot about the warning the previous one gave. Instead of a text box, the savepoint spawned a fire dragon boss fight (it looked a lot like the fire dragon from Ocarina of Time).

As a child I always had nightmares of this little boy who would knock on my window at night asking to be let in, and I’d tell him no. Well then he would come into my home and murder my family. The little boy appeared in my dreams for many years until I outgrew them. But those dreams really did traumatize me.

So recently, I had a dream on how the little boy was created. It had me pretty shaken up since I’ve had nightmares of the little boy when I was younger. So a man stood before what I presumed to be the devil since I only saw a back of a person. And it was a human person but he had a very evil presence. He spoke to the man saying: “I am going to make you into a little boy.” And the man confused asked “why a boy?” The devil responded saying “I’m going to make you a boy so you will bring other children to me, because little boys and girls will trust another child. But not a man.” The man nodded his head in agreement and then the devil transformed him into the little boy I had nightmares of as a child.

I'm writing about this one cause I just woke up from it and it kind of through me for a loop. It was actaully kind of nightmarish, but nightmares are so routine for me that I don't wake up from them startled anymore. However, what did wake me up was the fact that the dream was so cinematic, and how it was styled after a documentary about a small town in god knows where.

Anyway, it primarily centered around the power structure in this small town, about the local politicians and business heads and some really awful goings on related to missing children or were either being molested or used in satanic rituals. One of the stories was about a little girl who went missing, and in the midst of the search for her, the mayor sent the gift of a large recliner to the mother of the child, with a card saying ""Don't worry, [insert name here]"". The mother found this to be kind of crass and mystifying, and others speculated that this ""really nice recliner"" (and it's so odd but I remember it was like a cream-colored, leather Berca-Lounger...yup, even down to the brand) was in fact some kind of warped payment because the daughter had been taken by the ""higher-ups"" in the town.

Then there was a story about a really awful dentist who was also heavily involved in the town's politics, who despite being inept and messing up people's operations time and time again -- almost as if he took pleasure in mutilating them -- was somehow protected and allowed to keep office. The documentary then went into detail about one such patient, but what was shown wasn't really even entirely within the realm of dentistry: entire parts of the man's body had been excavated, down to his thighs, and he needed assistance to stand and even had to use special signals to communicate and part of the documentary centered on his ""rehabilitation"" and the physical therapy required to make him a communicative being again.

Finally, the show began talking about a boy who was kind of the town mascot in the sense that he was the grandchild of the biggest family in town, their lone heir, and what a weird person he turned into and his troubles with the law that even the family couldn't hide despite their power because they were so numerous and egregious. The documentary ended with a look at the boy, now late teen's, internet profile where he went by the profile, ""2SadForUMrSatan"". The Username stood out so vividly and the commentators in the documentary were saying how it was obvious he was used in the rituals as a boy and how it royally fucked him up.

Then I woke up. Yeah. I guess my question is, can anyone make sense of this, and has anyone experienced a dream like this before? It was so weird how it was incredibly well shot, had camera tricks and the exact kind of commentary you'd expect from a documentary of this nature. I also found its theme quite interesting because I'm not really a huge ""there's a giant satan worshiping cult"" guy. Like, I could see dreaming up something like this if I were, or had been thinking about such conspiracy theories, but truly nothing like this has even crossed my mind as of late.

I heard of false awakenings before and have experienced a few of them, this was something else though. This was a false awakening nightmare loop, that looped about 3-4 times. It went as follows: 

Loop 1: I woke up in my bedroom in my bed with my ambient music I play every night to help go to sleep. Some reason my deceased dog was in my bed sleeping with me so to quietly not wake her up I manually turned down my Alexa that it plays on, then my tv flickered and desplayed an error message saying ReS or something. I went back to sleep.

Loop 2: I woke back up in my bedroom with the ambient music playing loudly again, the tv was also playing loudly and I felt an evil presence this time. I got up turned off the tv, lowered the Alexa and went back to bed.

Loop 3: I woke up back in my bedroom same shit, loud music and now flickering loud television, I was yelling at my Alexa to turn itself down but she wasent. The evil prescience was strong now. I got up out of bed and both my closet doors were wide open and for some reason whenever I looked at them the feeling of dread and evil got extremely strong. I went up to my tv and turned it off, I stepped on something. It was an old iPhone 4. I picked it up and the background was this weird array of colors, I for some reason thought this was my phone but it’s not (I have an iPhone X). I plug it into charge and that’s when the evil feeling was at its highest. My tv turned itself back on again and was playing gibberish. I got back into my bed.


Loop 4: again woken by the Alexa and tv, this time it felt like whatever the presences was, was now standing on top of my bed. I hid under the covers, heart beating a thousand miles per hour. I felt the presence dissipate for a second so I decided to lower the Alexa with my voice but it didn’t work, the presence was back and I hid under my covers in fear. Whatever it was, it grabbed my ankle and yanked me (the exact same way the girl was yanked in the movie the conjuring). I threw the covers off and ran upstairs, there was groceries all over the floor, it was nighttime and everyone was asleep, I was bolting it to my parents room and was going to sleep on their floor like a little kid (I’m an 18 year old male btw that’s how terrified I was). Then the rest was a blur. 

I then woke up for real and smoked a cigarette and typing this out. During the loops I felt groggy and exhausted and they all had the weird “dream” feel to them yet felt somewhat real, I never had this happen before. Has this happened to anyone else?

So last night I realized I was dreaming and asked the lady I was working with if she dreams in black and white. She told me in her dreams she just narrates to herself. People in dreams dream too!

So, just out of curiosity I told her she was in a dream....

She goes over to the wall to a black thing and checks. Then she starts screaming and staring at me face distorted, jaw practically to her chest, not even stopping for a breath. This is not going how I expected so I try to calm her down by telling her “I was just joking. You are not in a dream. I was just joking!” She calmed down a bit and I apologized for scaring her with a stupid joke. Whew!

But that wasn’t the end...

Next she comes after me with a knife, trying to slash my wrist as I deflect her flailing arms. After a bit of this I take to the skies to get away from crazy lady. But her knowing she was in a dream gave her flight too! So I try to go to a private place to hold a decent conversation with her but she is not listening to a word I am saying. I finally got away from her and commented to another person in my dream about how crazy she is...

Yes, it got worse. EVERYONE in my dream started attacking me with knives! At this point I’ve had enough of this and forced myself awake. 

Annoyed and very tired, I immediately go back to sleep. In this new dream a guy from the last dream has crossed over and wants to kill me! This time with a gun! I tell him “you can’t kill me. In another dream I was shot three times in the head and once in he shoulder and guess what: I didn’t die. What are you going to do?” Motion to the gun. “Shoot me till I’m hamburger? I’m not going to die.” 

The alarm goes off, I hit snooze, go back to sleep and the dream resets. In this dream I get a pile of letters from these people! Ugh! It’s time to get up anyway. 

Never again!!

TL;DR: People in my dream went crazy and tried to kill me when I told them they were in a dream.

We were in a group of people. We were all in a large room. I think the man was helping me ride a scooter or a bike, and I started sliding off of it. But I was trying not to touch him or lean on him, as we were attracted to each other, but I'm married (happily IRL; I guess in the dream, too!) and he must have been married too. Or at least respected that I am.

But I felt a sense of urging from the people around us, and gave in, and ""lost my balance"" and he caught me and we embraced. And it was so innocent and pure and beautiful. Beautiful in a life-changing way. Then we pulled back from each other and looked into each other's souls and we just knew. It wasn't to be.

Then I woke up and was overcome with longing. Longing for something that can never and will never be fulfilled. I've spent the entire day stifling sobs because a piece of my heart is missing now. And my eyes are leaking from writing about it.

0.0,aglf7a,32.0,103.0,"It's been about 15 days since I quit smoking marijuana and since then I have had dreams almost every night of sleep. This is something I have not been use to for many years and it just makes me feel awesome. All the dreams I've been having have been great. Some are wacky and some are just really satisfying. Last night however, I definitely had a nightmare, the worst I have had in 10+ years and maybe my whole life and I really want to tell the person that takes their time to read this. I still remember quite a bit of the dream since it was extremely vivid and detailed so I'm going to try to explain this the best I can.

This dream began in my mom's bar.  Now this is a real place in my life that I spend a lot of time at since I've been going there since I was a kid and that I just started working there (I'm 23 now). It's a somewhat small bar, probably can comfortably sit 20-30 people plus 2 full size pool tables and a back office which I do the payroll and such. Anyways, in the dream, it was just me and my dog, Domino, hanging out at the bar by ourselves late at night. I can't really be sure as to why I was there so late but I felt the intention that I was going to be staying throughout the whole night. Most of the lights were dimmed and I only had one TV on.

So, there I am sitting at the bar top watching whatever was on the TV that sits in the corner above. Domino was asleep underneath my stool and I remember looking up at the analog clock next to the TV and it said 3:30am. I feel shocked about how fast time has gone by even though I had no other reference to the time before. Then suddenly the landline phone in the back office starts ringing. I run back there and pick it up off the wall and it was one of my good friends (whom I drink with at this bar the most with) and he is speaking frantically. I could barely understand what he was saying and told him repeatedly to calm down. All he could mutter out was ""please leave the bar and come meet me at my house."" I tried asking what was wrong but he had hung up before he could tell me anything else. This is when I started to feel worried.

I started to pack up my things in my space theme backpack (that I have had for years), and I begin to hear a very quite noise. Domino's ears start to perk up as he must of awoke to the same sound I heard. Then it gradually gets louder turning into a whining sound of some sort. I turn the TV off and sit back down on the stool and look around and listen to where this sound is coming from. After about what seemed like 1 minute of whining I hear a child's laughter clear as fucking day and at this point my dog is standing up hugged against the legs of the stool. My heart fucking dropped and I immediately start panicking. I get up to go back into the office and Domino starts barking, aggressively. Before I get into the back the light above one of the pool table turns on, and I turn to see a little ass kid laughing under the light. He had black hair with a bowl cut and his eyes were pitch black. I'm so distraught at this point I start walking backwards unable to look away. My heart is pounding and I remember my hands couldn't stop shaking. As I was walking backwards toward the back office I try to say something but couldn't physically get any words out. Then right has the child started to make it's way to my side of the bar, I trip over Domino who must of been behind me and I fall flat on my face and wake up.

I'm still getting chills right now writing this and I'm kinda worried that I might remember this one for quite sometime. I seriously woke up sweating like crazy and scared out of my mind. I am thankful that is was just a dream and that it's all over but holy shit I just can't get over just how detailed everything was in this dream. I wish I could of explained that in better detail but, no words could do justice.

So the dream started with the four world leaders in a small room, with a blast furnace behind them, and a table with ingredients Infront.

They were given the objective of making the most solid cookies that weren't burnt.

They got to work immediately, for some reason, and started mixing their ingredients, the top gear cast talking about their mixing abilities

After a few unsuccessful cooking attempts, Trump stormed off like a child, and was replaced by Richard Hammond, who may or may not have been dressed like a death metal enthusiast for a moment or two.

The competition we t on, and they started getting some success. Near the end, Putin just tossed his mix on a tray, threw it in the furnace for ten seconds, and got the stiffest cookies you've ever seen in your life.

Bush disappeared into a door that wasn't there a moment ago, and emerged with some beautifully glazed cookies.

Unfortunately they weren't as solid, so he lost. Hammond decided to break one of bush's cookies on camera, to prove that he lost, so they are those.

A moment later, having been inspired by Putin, Obama produced the second hardest cookies, and the two winners went over to a corner, and had a talk.

Eventually, Hammond managed to fix trump's mess, and got into a gracious third place, deciding to eat his on the spot.

At the end, Clarkson draws the attention of the camera to the two in the corner, where Putin, asked Obama out for a drink at the nearby pub/bar, he suggested vodka, but Obama had work later, so they shared a single beer.

I was checking my grade (which was an A), when I noticed a notification from my teacher that said there was an urgent problem with my grade that came up. I did some more investigation and found that there was suspicion that I was guilty of sexual assault and scheduled to meet in court in my college town 7 hours away this week.

Obviously, I was shocked and horrified and racked my brain trying to figure out how this came to be. The only lead I had is that for this psych class, I had presented a power point about rapists and their motivations - pretty dark stuff. As part of the presentation I included an interview of an imprisoned rapist and wrote out a quote by him admitting his crime.

So I looked through my PowerPoint and finally had an aha moment. It turned out that I had forgotten to add the quotation marks outside the prisoner’s monologue. This made it look like I was speaking from my own personal experience and admitting I had raped someone.   My instructor had flagged my presentation and reported it to authorities, and now I had to look like a fucking idiot in court explaining to judge how I falsely confessed a crime as serious as rape in such a stupid way. And then I spent the rest of the dream stressing out about finding my court notice because I forgot the time and date, getting a ride back, getting s lawyer, and paying for it all.

There were points when I debated if it was all dream, even in my first few minutes of wakefulness, because even though lots of details were different (I never even took abnormal psych), the dream was remarkably coherent and occurred in real time. Sure hope these stop, seeing your entire life fall apart for a half hour or so because of a stupid grammatical mistake is not much fun.

A lot of people in the world seem to not fully understand just how downright magical dreams are. No matter how many strange dreams I have, I never stop being fascinated by the basic idea of a dream. The brain constructing a surreal narrative out of thoughts, emotions, memories and experiences generated over the last few weeks, and tricking you into thinking it was really happening. A series of fragments arranged into a constantly evolving nonsensical story. The brain creating abstract, original art by itself.

Seriously. So many people just say ""I had a weird dream last night"" as if it's nothing. Sure, dreaming is normal and everyone does it, but holy crap is it unappreciated. Regardless if what your dream entails, the very fact that we *can* dream is just awesome to me.

I can remember two of my dreams from last night: In one, I dreamt that I was looking at some massive, sitting giants with huge tusks and horns, grunting like rhinos. In the other I dreamt that a group of archaeologists found out that the ancient Egyptians had kept secret hamburgers within the pyramids all these years. The night before, I wasn't specifically thinking about giants, rhinos, pyramids and hamburgers, but the very fact that my brain was able to extract and combine previously thought-about information from my brain's archive of thoughts and memories, like a computer searching for lost documents, just wows me.

It's just... amazing. You never know what you're going to get, it can be literally anything. And what makes it even stranger is the fact that while you're dreaming, you treat it as entirely normal. You hear sounds that aren't actually there, your brain is just saying those things to you by itself. Sometimes you meet people in dreams and it's like you've known them your entire life. You just accept stuff, no matter how weird it is, and sometimes you wake up with new ideas and conclusions that can guide you in waking life. Stuff you never would have thought about.

Sometimes I have really unpleasant dreams that leave me so shaken that I can't get back to sleep. A few weeks ago I dreamt that I was lost in my old school, searching for brother; I kept finding locked doors and large objects blocking my path. When I found him he was having an intense stomach ache while some really disturbing, distorted grunge music was playing in the background. It was horrible and I hated my brain for subjecting me to it. But even then, *it's fascinating*. What did it mean? Why was I shown this? It's almost like your brain is giving you a puzzle or riddle to solve every night.

I know this might be a weird post, because again, dreaming isn't some recent discovery, dreaming has occurred since the first life existed. Perhaps I'm just easily impressed, but dreaming will never stop being amazing to me. Imagine if we just went to sleep and woke up, and nothing happened in between. Just imagine that. It's such a shame that the Pixar movie ""Inside Out"" only touched upon this concept a little bit because an entire movie about ""Dream Productions"" would be a monumental film because there's just so much you could do.

Okay, I got a bit carried away with writing that but you get the idea, I just think most people don't understand the phenomenon of dreaming. Or maybe they do, and don't want to talk about it because they think it's geeky or childish to talk about them.",top,Can we all just agree that dreaming in general is insanely awesome?,85.0
0.0,1meyvs,11.0,86.0,"I have been permanently effected by a dream that I had several months ago. In my dream I was walking and talking to some friends. Then a psycho runs by with a knife and stabs me. He then grabs me and slices my throat and then runs away. My friends are all there freaking out. I can kind of see them but my eyes are teared up. Im holding my throat. It kind of stings but really I cant feel any pain, just freaking out because I cant fucking breath! My fingers are going numb and I'm so confused. I don't know whats going on. I can't believe that this is happening to me. My lungs are full of blood but I barely have enough energy to cough. Im just holding my neck for dear life. And then, I die. I actually fucking die in my dream. I remember dying like it was yesterday. I started to feel it happen. I knew that I was dying, fully aware. I was confused, and sad. I had regrets. Mostly though, I felt like I didn't have enough time. I kept thinking in those last seconds IF I ONLY HAD ANOTHER MINUTE ALL THAT I COULD DO WITH IT!!! In the first few seconds of the process of death I felt hope and sadness, I wanted someone to save me. But then the next second (seconds felt like forever) I gave up. Things were running through my mind so quickly. My friends were there looking at me but I wasn't focusing on them. Their faces were blurry. I was just looking at the sky thinking. I stopped thinking and that was it. Just nothing. No more dream. I didn't even wake up. I was just dead, plain fucking dead. I've never experienced nothing. I can't even say that I experienced nothing, I didn't experience anything! And then after what felt like 5 years (in retrospect, I had no perception of time during being dead) a whole new dream started. And I later woke up during that dream. I only realized that I had experienced death after waking up. I just woke up and sat there for several minutes in disbelief. I've died. And I've never felt more grateful in my life. Like I had been given a second chance. EVERYTHING was better that morning. The trees were greener, the air was sweeter, I loved everyone. My food tasted better. And since them I have not looked at life the same way again. Now that I know what death is like. Now that I have experienced it I know the importance of life like I never did before. But I no longer fear the unknown of death as much as I did. I do fear those last few seconds of the end though. I can barely describe how they felt. Just like every emotion at once. Your whole life doesn't flash by you in images. It flashes by you in emotions. If you've led a happy life your death will hopefully be dominated by happiness and not regret.

## 1. You Forget 90% of Your Dreams

Within 5 minutes of waking half of your [dream](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) is forgotten. Within 10, 90% is gone. 

 

## 2. Blind People also Dream

People who became blind after birth can see images in their **dreams**. People who are born blind do not see any   
images, but have **dreams** equally vivid involving their other senses of sound, smell, touch and emotion.

 

## 3. Everybody Dreams

Every human being [dreams](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) (except in cases of extreme psychological disorder). If you think you are not dreaming –   
you just forget your dreams. 

 

## 4. In Our Dreams We Only See Faces That We already Know

Our mind is not inventing faces – in our [dreams](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) we see real faces of real people that we have seen during our life but   
may not know or remember. We have all seen hundreds of thousands of faces throughout our lives, so we have an   
endless supply of characters for our brain to utilize during our dreams. 

 

## 5. Not Everybody Dreams in Color

A full 12% of sighted people [dream](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) exclusively in black and white. The remaining number dream in full color. Studies   
from 1915 through to the 1950s maintained that the majority of dreams were in black and white, but these results   
began to change in the 1960s. Today only 4.4% of the dreams of under-25 year-olds are in black and white. Recent   
research has suggested that those changing results may be linked to the switch from black-and-white film and TV to   
color media. 

 

## 6. Dreams are Symbolic

If you [dream](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) about some particular subject it is not often that the dream is about that. Dreams speak in a deeply   
symbolic language. Whatever symbol your dream picks on it is most unlikely to be a symbol for itself. 

 

## 7. Emotions

The most common emotion experienced in dreams is anxiety. Negative emotions are more common than positive   
ones.

 

## 8. You can have four to seven dreams in one night.

On average you can [dream](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/) anywhere from one or two hours every night.

 

## 9. Animals Dream Too

Studies have been done on many different animals, and they all show the same brain waves during dreaming sleep as   
humans. Watch a dog sleeping sometime. The paws move like they are running and they make yipping sounds as if   
they are chasing something in a dream.

 

## 10. Body Paralysis

*Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is a normal stage of sleep characterized by rapid movements of the eyes.* *REM sleep in*   
*adult humans typically occupies 20-25% of total sleep, about 90-120 minutes of a night’s sleep.*

During REM sleep the body is paralyzed by a mechanism in the brain in order to prevent the movements which occur   
in the dream from causing the physical body to move. However, it is possible for this mechanism to be triggered   
before, during, or after normal sleep while the brain awakens.

 

## 11. Dream Incorporation

Our mind interprets the external stimuli that our senses are bombarded with when we are asleep and make them a   
part of our [dreams](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/). This means that sometimes in our dreams we hear a sound from reality and incorporate it in a   
way. For example you may be dreaming that you are in a concert while your brother is playing a guitar during your   
sleep.

 

## 12. Men and Women Dream Differently

Men tend to dream more about other men. Around 70% of the characters in a man’s dream are other men. On the   
other hand, a woman’s dream contains almost an equal number of men and women. Aside from that, men generally   
have more aggressive emotions in their dreams than the female lot.

 

## 13. Precognitive Dreams

Results of several surveys across large population sets indicate that between 18% and 38% of people have   
experienced at least one precognitive dream and 70% have experienced déjà  vu. The percentage of persons that   
believe precognitive dreaming is possible is even higher – ranging from 63% to 98%.

 

## 14. If you are snoring, then you cannot be dreaming.

This fact is repeated all over the Internet, but I’m a bit suspicious whether it’s really true as I haven’t found any   
scientific evidence to support it.

 

## 15.You can experience an o r g asm in your dream

You can not only have s e x as pleasurable as in your real life while [dreaming](https://www.boredpanda.com/15-interesting-facts-about-dreams-dreaming/), but also experience an  o r g a s m  as   
strong as a real one without any wet results. The sensations felt while lucid dreaming (touch, pleasure and etc..) can   
be as pleasurable and strong (or I believe even stronger) as the sensations experienced in the real world.

But say I am riding an elephant in New York City and then another elephant issues me a ticket for riding a horse. (Made-up example). If I imagined this scenario in my concious state, it would make no sense. But in dream-world, it all somehow always makes sense and you never question anything.

Somehow your brain is convinced that you always ride elephants in the city and that you are supposed to or something. And if you actually question it at all, then your brain is REALLY good at filling in the gaps and plot holes. If you question it, then suddenly it was because youre in a parade or if you question why you got a ticket for riding a horse, then in your dream you look down and you are riding a horse and you ""mistakenly"" thought you were riding an elephant. 

These dreams can sometimes work so hard to make sense that they actually end up forming really elaborate stories and scenarios that honestly sound like a good plot from a movie sometimes. My brain is more creative at connecting ideas and being imaginative while dreaming than I could be when fully awake.

In the dream, I was in a long round brick tunnel with a shallow stream of water running through. I guess it was like an old sewer system? I could see the exit pretty far ahead of me, looked like it was night time but there was some source of light that shined dimly into the tunnel.

I started walking out and I heard a little kid beside me say ""Are you here to be my friend?"". I wasn't really sure what was going on and thought the kids might be lost so I said I'd be his friend. I could see him sitting in a shadow but I couldn't make out any details of what he looked like.

After telling him I'd be his friend his tone changed to where he sounded a bit more timid and asked ""You're...you're not like the others are you?""

It was just us so I wasn't sure how to respond and asked ""The others? It's just us buddy, what do you mean?"" He softly replied ""My other friends...when they come back, their faces are always different"".

At that moment I looked around and saw dead bodies all around me with demonic and mutilated faces. It looked like they had tried to scratch their own faces off. The eyes were gouged out, not sure if it was self inflicted or what.  I immediately ran away screaming but when I got to the end of the tunnel, I was teleported back to where I started.

And that's when I woke up screaming. I guess I'm not real sure why I'm posting this here but I don't typically remember my dreams and this was definitely one that I feel like I won't forget soon.

I'm going to use the Jungian Theory.

For Jung, every part or character or situation within the dream is a symbolism of your own characteristics or unconscious dynamics . So, when you dreamt about your ex, you have to ask yourself, what part of me is representated by my ex?. It doesn't mean you are dreaming about him. Everyone or every situation as weird or normal it seems it is speaking about your current life. 

Every symbolism is personal, an analyst can help you to understand the symbol or interpret collective symbols. But your age, your history, where you live and everything around you are shaping your own symbols. 

So, if you  want someone to help you, you will need to give more information than just the dream itself and if you want to analyze your dreams I recommend the book Inner Work by Robert Johnson.

It started with me in a class room in some random state that I was in because of a school trip during Junior year of high school (I've never been to this state and no one in my dream was based off real people). While sitting in there I made eye contact with a beautiful girl, the most attractive I've ever seen. I instantly had a crush on her. From here is a long long story so I'll just skip around to the highlights. I made a new best friend, never got his name but it wasn't important at the time. We had a lot of adventures but one was the most intense and vivid part of the dream so I'll talk about that one. We were in a parking garage at the airport in some random city late at night, it was spooky but everything was going fine till we got close to the elevator we needed to take up. We saw a man in a hoodie walking quickly towards us and instantly knew there was going to be a problem. We started running and the man started chasing after us. My friend, we'll call him Charlie, made it to the elevator before me and the man caught me and took me to the ground. Charlie left in the elevator and the man sat atop of me and pulled out a knife, I thought I was going to die. The elevator opened and Charlie through him off and I made it to the elevator, saving my life. We were closer ever since then. Fast forward to when I met the girl again. Her name was Fable. We quickly fell in love, she proposed, we got married, bought a house, got some dogs, and I genuinely loved her. She was everything to me. Charlie moved in to a house right next to us. It was great. Me and Fable's home was small but it worked and spending our days together meant way more to me then what the house was like. We spent years together, then I woke up. I don't even have the vague idea of what Charlie looked like and with every minute the face of the most beautiful woman I've ever seen, my wife, Fable, slips out of my mind.

I fell in love with her when we were in high school. She just wanted to be friends and after graduation, she told me that she wanted to marry her best friend. Who she said was me. We've been through a lot. I was there doing all the things her boyfriends never did for her while we were friends. She would even get jealous when I had girlfriends and she did start a bit of drama with them. She would stay at my place when she didn't/couldn't go home. We did almost everything together. We were both in ROTC in high school so we ended up both wanting to join the military. We would get married after our service, start a family, and have a house with a picket fence, the &quot;dream&quot;...or so we thought at that age. We convinced each other we were soul mates.

Fast forward a couple of years after high school, we started having problems. Found out she was screwing around with some guys during her service through Facebook. We would talk on the phone every chance we could and our phone calls turned from telling each other sweet nothings...what we would name our kids, take them to iHop after church like how her dad used to with her...to just yelling at each other. She told me that she's not marrying him but me. Well, the fights on the phone worsened and we just fell apart completely.

Fast forward, again, to a few months ago, I have this dream. She was in it and I could smell her hair. I saw her face, her blue eyes staring into my soul. The thing what got me was that I could smell her hair. Like she was there, really there in my dream. I swear I could see her lips moving but I couldn't hear what she was saying. But that smell. It was undoubtedly her and it is the most sweetest smell I know. I woke up, wide-eyed, it was four something in the morning on a Sunday. I went to take a swig of Jack to calm my nerves. I couldn't smell her hair anymore. I couldn't even remember what that smell was, her shampoo, sure, but what shampoo, I don't remember but I know it when I smell it.

So I woke up to a nice sunset. I was in the backseat of the car and my friend was driving. Oddly, I felt this weird pressure on my shoulder, but it was light and warm.

I am determined to find out who did this to me so I walk back into the building adjacent to the parking lot. I ""pretend"" I'm working on a project on security measures and the people in the building give me a tour of their security area. While I'm there, I fess up and ask if I can have access to the security camera footage from a few hours ago because I wanted to find out who spray painted my car outside in the parking lot. For some reason, they say it's okay for me to look at the footage. So I'm given the footage, except the footage for some reason is on 8mm film. I ask if it's possible to borrow a film camera that will allow me to view the footage. The task of finding the perps becomes tedious as I have to look through a new reel of film every 10 minutes within a 2 hour window. This causes my dream to feel like is going on and on forever as several ""minutes"" pass by as I search. Finally I see three men in a frame. I get excited asking the front desk if there's any way to blow up the image so I can identify these three men. Just as I'm handed the blown up framed image, I start to wake up from my dream.

Hi! 

I keep having dreams of the same exact girl. She exists in real life and I barely know her. We met a while ago and we added each other on Facebook and that's it. We never message, or take classes together, or snapchat or follow each other on Instagram. I didn't initially find her eye-catching but she's a nice fella. 

Anyways, I keep having dreams with just her and it's as if we know each other so well. We're basically in love in these dreams and we'll have endless conversations and  cuddle and hug. Nothing in the dream feels sexual or weird. It feels super comforting and real too. I can literally still smell what it smelled like in my dream as we were sitting out in an open field together and I also feel her hand. We gaze at each other often and I feel like Im legitimately laughing and smiling while in these dreams. It's so realistic it's somewhat scary to be completely honest.

Last night I had a dream where I met this girl at school. She was amazing. She wasn't the most stunning woman ever, or the smartest. But she was just like me. Just another person who keeps doing what they need to do as best they can. We immediately liked each other.

Then I was going to work, and I saw her there too. Turns out we worked at the same place and never ran into each other before. At my real job, there are a ton of different departments and she just worked in an area I don't really go to. 

We started to fall in love. And the relationship was fantastic. It was open and honest. We did our best to support each other and be as understanding as possible. We would drive each other to school and to work, we would help each other with assignments, and we even got the other more deeply involved in our religion.

I proposed to her, and she said yes. Her parents liked me, my parents liked her, and even more important, our two families felt like one big one. 

But this is where things get sad. She cut herself at work when a customer asked her to carry something to their car. I'm trying to remember where she cut herself, but all i can picture is the ton of blood. I tried to help her but she had bled out before paramedics were there and she died.

My dream then seemed to skip forward a few months, I was working at a different place, and I was starting to fail at my schooling. My new job had a reputation of being haunted, and me being the scaredy-cat that I am was not thrilled. However, that's when I started noticing that instead of scary things happening, little things would make me think of her. I started to see things that we would say to each other pop up on white boards and written on the dust of windows. It culminated in a coffee mug spinning around so it would show the I love you design on it. 

I was trying to brush it off, but that's when she actually appeared to me. She said that she had watched me struggle to keep on going and decided it was time to help me like she used to. 

I was so excited to see her, but her being a ghost, I couldn't touch or hold her. But things went back to the way they were. She would ride along with me in the car, she sat in lectures with me and made her own version of the professor's notes from class, and she would clean my house before I would get home from work.

She stuck around with me for years, and I never looked for another girl because I had mine. My and her parents didn't believe me at first because they couldn't see her, but after she did something, I can't remember what, they believed me.

I eventually made it through school and finally got my degree in optometry, and she was there every step of the way for me. But unfortunately, thats when I woke up. 

The dream seemed so much more real than anything I've ever dreamed before. It was so amazing to have that kind of relationship. I don't think I've ever been in love with someone more than her, and I can't even remember her name from my dream. I know it's a silly thing to feel sad about, and I know that if i told anyone else about my dream they would probably laugh. I feel like I lived my entire lifetime last night, and everything went right. It feels ridiculous. I've been in relationships before, i've been in love before, but this just seemed so different.

I call these dreams ""stress\-dreams"" because they are always stressful in some way.

The Kidnapping

Part II: 
Smoothie Time!
-We didn't know how to kill him in a just manner, so we decided to make smoothies out of him. We found a large abandoned sink with a drain at the bottom and placed a hydraulic lift above him and the drain. He said ""I'm 5'8"" you can't make smoothies out of me"" and my friend replied ""once you hit 4'1"" you'll be dead and once you hit 3'1"" it's smoothie time!"". We put our cups at the below the sink, right above the drain pipe opening skin to a beer tap and turned on the press, after the screaming stopped and I could hear the crunching of bone commence we had ""rich bankster"" smoothies. I vividly remember seeing chunks of crushed intestine (apparently the guy didn't crap before we killed him), along with blood and most strikingly bone fragment in the drink.

Part III: 
A drink with the Bros

0.0,a5kgak,21.0,70.0,"A few months ago, I had this dream and it really, REALLY messed with my head for a couple of days.  


In this dream, there were no garbage cans. All trash pretty much got sent into an underground trash compactor that could be accessed where the storm drains were in major cities, and there were these sifters right where the curb connected with the road guiding trash to the sewers to be disposed of. Initially the dream was calm and just like a regular day. My daughter and I were walking towards a convention or some event in a major city wit her aunt. She decided it was a good idea to walk right on the curb. I continuously told her ""Be careful, you're going to fall,"" but being a kid, she did not listen. She did end up falling, but she caught herself right on the curb. Her backpack, however, slipped off and landed right on the sifters sending trash to the trash compactor.   


The dream went from feeling calm to high adrenaline. I yelled ""GRAB THE BACKPACK!"" as soon as I saw it slip off her shoulder. She tried to grab the backpack, but couldn't get it in time. The sifters guided it to the sewers to be destroyed. My daughter got on the road and ran towards the backpack until it fell in. ""Mom, the backpack fell inside! I think I can reach it."" I yelled ""FORGET THE BACKPACK!"" She jumped in anyway and yelled ""I can get it real quick and jump out!"" She couldn't. She kept slipping, because it continuously rolled to keep things INSIDE. I tried to grab her, but again, she kept getting pulled in (like if she was trying to climb up a wet slide). I heard the machine inside start up. The trash was going to get crushed. I jumped in and pushed her up. Her aunt grabbed her arm and pulled her out. I tried to jump and get out, but the entrance was getting closed. Every time I tried to reach for the opening, I got pushed back. My thought process in the dream once it started to get dark was to start yelling ""NO! NONONONONONONO!"" and when there was an audible, loud ""Clunk,"" the last word I said was ""Fuck,"" and everything was dark. I died. No light at the end of the tunnel.

0.0,8oesqg,25.0,71.0,"Hey everyone. I’ve been a very vivid dreamer all my life, and it has only gotten more realistic as I’ve aged. My dreams are colored, range from mundane to fantasy, and last anywhere between a few minutes to months. Yeah, months. In fact, that’s why I’m writing this post.

My dreams have gotten longer and longer over the past couple years, and what stuck to me was the excitement of having day-long adventure in some glowing forest. I definitely notice the length and enjoy the memories (I can remember most of the dream for the first few hours after waking) provided by so much content. 

Last night was different. I don’t want to describe the dream too much, but I’ll say that it was long enough to develop personality arcs among the characters, to watch several seasons of a sitcom, to unfold a complex conflict between one character and the rest of us, and to become skilled at this video game we would play. By the end of the dream, I was looking forward to spending time with the characters, and grew fond of most of them. 

Then I woke up, and I was almost shocked. I kept my eyes closed for maybe an hour and thought about the whole dream. A few months of my life were taken away from me, and the friends and enemies I had made were gone forever. The fact that it’s a dream abates the disappointment a little, but still, I lost a friend group in a few seconds. I mean, we had inside jokes about this sitcom. It was called Let’s Sing, and had some similarities to Friends. The video game was like a “battle royale” version of the sniper level in Call of Duty MW2. We would all meet in this swimming pool facility under our apartments. I even think I had a love interest. Gone.

I wish I could describe the full dream in detail, because it would be similar to sharing stories of a past friend group. It felt that real. Unfortunately, I have forgotten a lot of crucial details. I used to keep a dream journal, but my dreams became too complex to quickly record about a year ago. 

I guess my question is: has anyone has a similar experience, whether it was the length of the dream, or the attachment they felt? ",top,Does anyone here have and get attached to very long dreams?,71.0

0.0,2ye0is,5.0,66.0,"Okay well I’ve been reading all sorts of stories about reality glitches (a term new to me until a few days ago) and I’ve finally decided to write out my experience. I first posted this in the reality glitch subreddit and it was suggested that  I post it here as well. I still don’t know how to explain what happened but at least now I know what to call it since coming here.

When I was 10 years old I used to have a recurring nightmare about my death to put it bluntly. I cant remember all the details but in all of the dreams I would be looking through what might’ve been a window frame from the outside. There was also an orange jacket or garment on a chair inside that I could see through the window. I would make a motion as if I was going to ascend a rung and suddenly I would fall what felt like atleast 3 stories. Then I’d be lying down staring up at the sky and see a wooden ladder presumably from which I fell. The image of this ladder leaning against a house would be the last thing I’d see before waking up. These nightmares probably wouldn’t have caused me so much distress if it hadn’t been for how god damn real they felt. I could smell the air, feel the sun on my back. I could even feel the incredible pain throughout my body as I lay on the ground.

Anyways I pretty much forgot all about these nightmares as I grew older. I stopped having them around age 11 and never had one again. I’m 33 now and my good friend just got married to his high school sweetheart. We’ll call him Jerry. They live in a nice barn style house that he built himself. I have limited carpentry skills but despite knowing this my friend asked me to help him with certain parts of the building process: dry wall, putting in windows, shingling and whatnot. I think he just wanted to spend some quality man time with me to be honest.

It took a total of 11 months to complete the house. And like I said I would drop by from time to time to help Jerry with the odd job. Once the house was nearing completion Jerry had started putting in the windows. He asked me to come down one weekend to help him put some windows on the third floor. We ended up doing 3 that Saturday and called it quits around 7. Sunday morning Jerry called me up to ask a favor. There was a big storm coming in Sunday night and he had realized that while we did put the windows in, we didn’t seal one of them with caulking. He didn’t like the idea of water getting inside after we’d just put the dry wall up so he asked me to seal the window up soon if I could. He had to take his wife to the hospital so he was unable to plus I only lived 20 minutes away.

So after a brief Mcdonalds breakfast I headed down to the house, found the caulking gun and then searched for a ladder. Jerry had brought two down to the site—one aluminum and one wood. I grabbed the wooden one as it was already on the side of the house with the unsealed window. Once I propped it up against the house I began to ascend. Once I was high enough I was able to peer through the window and when I did I felt like a jolt of electric fear went through my body. The nightmares I had as a kid came back to me in a flash. The smell, the warm sun hitting my back k. It was identical to the dream. And I also recognized Jerry’s orange hunting jacket that he had left on a chair on the other side of the window. Everything was exactly the fucking same. Remembering the rest of the dream I quickly DESCENDED the ladder and went to my truck feeling kind of disturbed. I stood there for a while debating if I should try to seal the window or not. In the end what I did was try my best to seal it from the inside. I’ll admit I did a half assed job but hey can you blame me. I finished up and went home. Trying to forgot about it all.

The following weekend Jerry asked me to come down and help him shingle the roof. When I arrived there I noticed Jerry was limping a bit. When I asked him what happened he said he rolled his ankle when one of the rungs on his wooden ladder broke. He was only a few feet up so it wasn’t a big deal. That was it for me. I stayed calm but mentally I was a wreck. Not only did my dream somehow predict that ladder breaking, I half knew about it but never even warned Jerry. I felt like shit.

That’s about it though. Later on I did realize that I must’ve had the ladder upside down when I climbed it, meaning the defective rung would be near the top. When Jerry went to use it he must’ve flipped it the other way so the rung was near the bottom. I still think about this from time to time and it never ceases to disturb me.",top,My childhood nightmare saved my life,66.0

Disclaimer I changed all the names in the story bc I always feel a little crazy when I tell it....

Some background: 
my mother was never into drugs and alcohol. her memories have always been reliable, and she’s not really the “storyteller” type.

Alight lets get into it:

My mom first became pregnant in 1999. It was a fairly normal pregnancy, and because it was her first she was EXTREMELY careful and cautious about everything. She didn’t want any avoidable complications, which is why I ruled out any type of drugs at work. 

She had already found out that the baby was going to be a girl, and as for the name she had already picked out Jasmine. 

My mom had always loved that name and she always felt the first girl she had was going to be named that. Never once had she thought about another name that year, and everyone (especially my other family members) knew this. 

My mom doesn’t dream much, or if she does, she doesn’t really remember them. However, about 7 - 8 months into her pregnancy she had what she called “the most vivid dream” of her life. 

She says that she was in a white room with two little girls. Both around the same age (around the 7 - 9 range). 

One little girl had Asian features: light skin, straight, black hair, and she was very energetic, exited, and talkative. My mom said this little girl got very excited when she first arrived and started saying “Pick me, pick me!” over and over. This went on for a bit, with my mom just staring at the two of them for awhile. 

But then my mom said she felt more intrigued by the other little girl in the room. The other one was practically the opposite of the first girl. She had dark skin, curly hair, and was very reserved and shy, not having said a word the whole time. 

My mother basically ignored the first girl and went over to the darker child. She asked the kid for her name and the kid responded simply “Paris.” My mom then crouched down and held Paris’ hand. She remembered Paris smiling brightly, and then she woke up. 

My mom then told me that she wrote off the dream almost immediately. She briefly thought it was interesting, and then moved on with her days. It wasn’t until about a week later when my whole family had gone out to eat together when the dream began to have meaning to her. 

My male cousin, who was about 11 or 12 at the time, walked over to my mom and began chatting with her about the baby. She noted that it was a little weird because he had never shown much interest in her pregnancy and it was usually my girl cousins who talked to her about the baby. But nonetheless she engaged with him and they went back and forth a bit. 

Then at the end of the conversation, he asked to touch her stomach. She said yes and he rested his hand on her belly. He then looked into my mom’s eyes and said, word for word:

“Are you going to name her Paris?”

This freaked my mom out to no end. She hadn’t told ANYONE about the dream. Not even a tiny bit. She had also never shown an interest in that name. In fact no one ever had in my family up until that point. 

Bewildered, confused, and creeped out, she asked “What?” And my cousin repeated his question. 

“Are you going to name her Paris?”

After getting confirmation what she heard earlier was correct, she nervously asked him “Why would I name her that?” and with childlike nonchalance, he just shrugged and returned to his seat, suddenly disinterested in the whole conversation. 

Of course my mom couldn’t forget about it, and after that experience, she had made the decision to name her baby Paris instead of Jasmine. 

She figured the universe was trying to tell her something I guess?

THIS IS WHERE IT JUST GETS CRAZY. 

My mom then gives birth to me “Paris,” right? 

YEARS later, she’s telling me that I’m exactly like the Paris from her dream. I have dark skin, curly hair, and I was (especially so when I was younger) very reserved and shy. 

Fast forward 9 years later and my sister was born (named Jasmine, the name my mother had always intended to have a daughter be named). My sister looks and acts exactly the way the nameless girl from my mom’s dream did as well. With my sister being rowdy and a little annoying (but I luv her!) and energetic. She is asian with pale skin and dark, black hair as well!

(Of course we have different dads, but isn’t it crazy the dream thing already knew that? Are our lives already planned out? BUT THATS A QUESTION FOR ANOTHER THREAD lol)

My mom said that after seeing both of us “grow up” so closely to the girls from her dream, she had decided to bring up the weird family outing moment to my male cousin. 

She asked him, again, why he had asked if she was going to name her baby Paris and he has NO RECOLLECTION OF THE CONVERSATION at all. Of course, he was young AND it was a long time ago, but he said he doesn’t even remember mentioning the name “Paris” before my mom had told my family she had decided to change the name of her first born from Jasmine to Paris. She was pretty weirded out due to that sole experience being the reason she made the decision in the first place, but nonetheless here we are. 

Now my mom has 2 daughters, both of which turned out tit-for-tat the way they did in her dream 18 years ago. 

I still think about it here and there. I have so many questions, I don’t even know where to start. I guess the biggest one though is:

In the beginning of the dream, I was boarding a plane with my mom and was sitting in the back of the plane. There were still people getting off the plane from the previous flight (obviously this makes no sense but ya know) and I had a couple conversations with two guys who were about to leave. Eventually the guys left and as I was talking to my mom, suddenly the plane jerked forward and started flying despite the boarding process not being done and I could see the ground getting further away outside the window. The plane was jerking around and flying erratically so I assumed in my dream that the plane had been hijacked. I could hear everyone screaming and when I looked at my mom I could see the fear in her face. As I look past my mom I see the ground now getting closer and closer at an alarmingly fast rate. When I realized we were about to die, I decided to close my eyes and I could still hear everything, all the screams and the sound of the plane diving and the engines roaring. Suddenly in the darkness I heard the crash and felt the heat of the impact as I assume the plane exploded. Then all of the noise got cut off and there was nothing. When the nothing took over, I could feel my body going numb and at this point I was fully aware that it was a dream and knew what was happening. I could feel myself dying in my dream and it felt like real life but I had the ability to wake myself up, I knew I could but I waited a few seconds before doing it. Then I finally woke up.

I was so distressed by that dream because it felt so real, like I'd actually died. It was hard to go back to sleep after that.

Quick timeline -

He was dating a girl for around 3 yrs (we’ll call her T)

We met, had a connection 
 
He left his girlfriend, we started dating shortly after

We were together for a year 

Towards the end we had a lot of problems yada yada, I see him getting friendly w/ T, I see where this is headed...

We break up, he eventually gets back with her as I predicted 

Life goes on, then I’m set to go to Rome 6mo later


So, there’s one night in Rome that I’m sleeping lol. (Rome is +6hours from EST.) In this moment it is 2AM here, 8PM there. 

The dream: 

I’m hovering. I’m hovering above T as she opens the door which walks through a great room into a hallway. I’m floating in a hallway as if I am the ceiling itself. I’m in a house I’ve never seen. There’s carpet, beige walls, a few doors on either end. And most notably, the hallway is lined with rose petals and candles. T is walking down the rose petaled hallway and Im right there with her. It dark, but the candles light it up. At the end of the hallway, there’s lights on in the living room. (it’s notable to say there is not furniture in this house - in the dream) In the center of the room is a shrine of sorts, with photos of T and my ex, as he sits there on one knee. The rose pedal procession lead to hundreds of petals on and under the shrine, candles, and the family of T on both ends smiling and awaiting her. (these are people I have never met or seen in real life yet their faces/voices were as clear as day) There are photos of T and my ex that I have never seen in real life, on this shrine thing and I hear my ex, in his exact voice say, “T, will you mary me?” Her family is laughing and crying in the background.

I shot up from my sleep instantly. And I am the epitome of a deep sleeper. Without thinking, almost as if I was still in a sleep state, I reach & grab my phone. My very first gut reaction is to check T’s instagram page in a stalker fashion. There was no thought process going on in my mind, maybe I was in a trance when I woke up? Maybe my subconscious wanted to validate? Idk. 

What do I see as her most recent post? A VIDEO OF MY DREAM. THE EXACT DREAM. The carpet, the lighting, the placement of the fucking candles, the rose petals, every SINGLE family member - people I have NEVER seen until this moment, aside from my dream - there, in real life, as if it were an episode of black mirror.

The reactions, laughing, crying, the voice of my ex asking the question, all within the same time order and procession as my dream, that I had seemingly IN the same moment as the actual event. I checked the time she posted it. 2 minutes ago, it read, the very time that I was apparently dreaming this moment. 

 Is this wild or is this wild?

The next day I double checked to make sure. the post was still there. That was real. That happened. Was I projecting? Was my spirit there, 3,000 MILES away, across the atlantic ocean, experiencing this moment in real time? Why? How? Why only this once in my life has such a thing happened? I’ve had a lot of strange dream experiences, premonitions of events, people, places... But never, dreaming a moment that was happening in real time halfway across the world. 

Is this unprecedented? It’s been about a year since I’ve had the dream but I remember it like it was last night. Still think about, it in terms of “what the actual fuck did i do in my sleep” 

Anything similar? Any ideas?

Backstory: 
I loved someone very much. He was my best friend and we ended up falling in love. But alas we were young and we had a falling out/breakup, I do not want to go into details but I had to break it off with him, block him from everything and never spoke to him since. This was about 6 years ago and we shall refer to him as “T”.

About 3 years ago T started appearing in my dreams, they were always the same context: we’d meet each other excitedly then tell each other what we’ve been up to while exploring together. At first I disregarded these dreams but started to notice a pattern every month. I’d keep trying to ignore them and then they became so frequent I’d see him in my dreams every night. I felt like it was a sign for me to contact him. 

I finally gave in and contacted him (in real life) and met. The meeting felt like a wonderful closure talk. The next week I had a dream of us meeting again. However, this time he excused himself to go to the bathroom and then someone came up to me and put a bunch of random items on the table. “This belongs to you” she said, and when I looked down they were all items T had given me. When he came back to the table, I looked at him and said, “these are yours” and got up and walked away. That was the end of my dreams...

...or so I thought, now a year later, T is back in my dreams, but each dream is a different situation. I can’t remember all the situations, only that T was in my dreams for all of it. This week alone I’ve had a dream with him in it every night.

I can’t shake it out of my head! I need thoughts as to what my subconscious is doing/trying to say. It’s been 6 years, I’ve happily moved on with my life but I don’t understand why T is appearing so much in my dreams! It’s going to drive me crazy!

I also had no idea what heaven, or hell, or anything on a religious matter was. My parents grew up Mormon and chose to shelter me from all religions as a kid growing up. After my grandmas funeral, I was so torn and sad that I didn’t know her as well as I wanted. My mom always tells me of my dreams as a kid because they freaked her out too. She had no idea how I knew all these things about heaven when I’d never talked about it before. This was the dream I had after her death, the part that freaks me out was I had no idea what heaven was as a child and how me as a 8 year old was able to describe something so close to heaven. 

In the dream:

I was laying in my bed when my grandma sat at the end of my bed, she whispered my name “Taylor”. I slowly waked up to her smiling face. She then said “I need to show you a place. Please come with me.” I nodded, of course. And I’m not quite sure how we ended up in what I believed to be heaven but we just did. I saw a room, that was pure white. Where absolutely no darkness was allowed. She led me to a table in which every person I ever met in my life sat at. But they all were the ages they were their most happy at. We all sat and laughed about our lives on earth and everyone was so happy. I told my mom that no sadness or evil could ever be there because it wasn’t allowed. That everything was white and gold and my grandma told me that this was where she lived now. But that she would always watch over me on earth. My grandma then took me back home to my bed, she tucked me in and said she loved me. Then I woke up in real life.

I’ve had so many insane and wild dreams but the ones I’ve had of heaven, hell and demons are the ones that never left my mind nor my moms. Has anyone else had a dream about heaven or a place that is so pure and good?

I’ll use my most recent bad dream as an example which occurred a night ago and is why I’ve been thinking about this. My dream was completely normal and I was at a zoo-type establishment. I was not lucid at all until I was confronted with the “big bad” which turned my dream into a nightmare. The “villain” was an escaped gorilla which was standing outside it’s enclosure. Instantly I became just so slightly lucid to make the decision to run and when I started running, the gorilla began chasing me. It was then I realized that if I don’t leave soon, the gorilla was going to catch up and kill me. As I was running I began to look straight up, not into the sky with my head but with my eyes as if I was rolling them back into my head. 

For some reason ever since I was a kid that was my “nightmare protocol”. Every time I was in a bad situation in a dream and I needed a quick escape I would instantly become just lucid enough to look up and my dream would slowly fade out and I would wake up. I can’t do this in regular dreams or spontaneously become lucid to leave. This also only seems to happen in very fast paced nightmares (like being chased) or when I am in danger and I have to leave or else I will die.

Fuck man

I just dreamed about a book

Like, i had scenes happening in my head, with characters and events and stuff

Then i kinda laid back and i could see a book. There was a title and the name of an author, although it kinda changed, but i managed to write down a version of it. On the cover there was an image that looked like something by Matisse with lots of overly simplified brown silhouettes holding hands and forming a circle

 On the upper left corner there was the title and the name of the author

 There were images in the book, one was of an African lady with a colorful headscarf playing with a snake

 The book's name was in French but it could translate to ""44 stories to cry on a maiden's shoulder""

 The book also had a story in itself. The woman who wrote it (her name was Leïla Cosi) was a primary school teacher who had asked kids who liked her work to send her 44 prompts, and instead of writing short stories like a normal person, she somehow made them all fit into one novel with one hero who was a teenage boy, and while his name was never mentioned and he conveniently had the face of the hero from the last show i watched, he made me think of you so much

 The hero went to places, had stuff happen and thought about things. There was a reflection about how a single picture could move people to tears if it had a signification behind it. The example given was that picture of a muslim woman putting her scarf on the star of her jewish friend to hide it, you've probably seen it already. And he was saying to himself, it's funny how in any other context, people wouldn't bat an eye to a picture of a woman putting a piece of fabric on another woman's chest, but the image is powerful because of what it implies

 I was in first person most of the time btw. Being the guy and all, not me

 At some point he was in a shitty little food truck in the middle of the night in a bad part of town and he had to get home by train. He went out at night a lot. The perspective kept switching between the object, the book, and the scenes that were in it. I'm probably missing many but whatever.

 At some point there was a strange, cryptic scene that was drawn on the bottom of the book. It was the hero as a kid, like 10-14 yo, who was in a dark room and was taking stuff out of his yellow backpack (the yellow backpack is important) and putting it down in the room. There was some furniture, an MP3 player and one of these fancy tin cars that kids have that you can sit on. Then he stomped on the car until it was destroyed and resumed his life. I don't think there was any sound

 A scene that really struck with me actually involved [a person I see/used to see in my dreams, until i killed her months ago because i thought it would be temporary, but apparently it's not cause i keep seeing her corpse. It's really sad]. Apparently the guy had killed her because she'd gone crazy and threatened him and a friend that was with him. It all happened in a sort of tiny kids' play area, with sand and stuff. Now her mildly rotten body was on the ground in a small artificial garden that was in a room of the guy's house. He was growing more and more worried about people figuring out. He was wondering if he should've told people he did it in self defense and have his friend testify for him instead of hiding the body, but now it was too late. He half hid it in the ground and then put lots of grass over it and tore leaves and entire branches from the trees to put over it. The knife was also laid at her feet and he had to hide it too. Because of dream logic, it wasn't important to be subtle and it was perfectly fine to have the body lay on the ground with things hiding it but still making the shape of the body, as long as you couldn't see any parts of the actual body.

His little sister told him that his mom had found his backpack and washed it and she found a knife inside and that's how she knew. But apparently the knife was made to practice knifeplay with a classmate who wanted to try it (That's when i thought of you. And in the dream, i even wanted you to read the book because of that, and i was going on and on about how it was underrated, since it always passed as an experimental kids' book made by a glorified elementary school teacher.) There was also a scene where a friend was inquiring about how the guy's sales were going. He had to sell lots of old cars he had for some reason. At some point, he told her he'd sold all the cars and that was a good thing.

 Now, in my dream, i actually googled the author. There were two pictures with her face and a sort of linkedin-like website that had her profile. She was considered an amateur writer but mostly a teacher. That was her main job. I literally created this person and some of her psychology.

I feel the most nauseating nightmares are the ones with the false escapes. I can’t get the fear out of my head of being trapped in this cycle again. 

I began dreaming without realizing I had fallen asleep, drifted off in my room in the glow of my salt lamp. I heard a strange muttering from my closet, growing steadily louder. An invisible thing was coming towards me, muttering maniacally. I realized I was rigid and unable to move, and the thing I couldn’t see pulled my blankets slowly, deliberately over my face. I tried to cry out, but my voice was gone. The thing was laughing as it pressed down on my chest, and as it touched me sexually. I screamed and screamed soundlessly, unable to move or even whimper. Struggling, struggling against the binding of that paralysis, I heard the thing retreating back to the closet as it chuckled. 

I woke up -or so I thought- on the floor of my room instead of on my bed. My phone was playing cartoons at a high volume. I was filled with relief that I was awake, but also disturbed to find myself on the floor and my phone on when I knew I had it off. I laid back on the bed, trying to calm down. 

As I turned off the video I heard another sound, this time behind my head. I can not describe the sound at all -only that it wasn’t human and that it was very threatening. There was something there, behind the curtains at the head of my bed. Again, all my limbs locked into place. I could not turn my head to see what it was, though I could sense it parting the curtains, beginning to reach through towards me. Agonizingly, I could hear my brother and sister converse just outside my room. I tried and tried to scream for them, mouthing “Help me! Help me!” over and over... but their voices only moved farther away into the house. No voice. The fingers stretched between the curtains, reaching my hair. The back of my neck felt the most physical fear of my whole body, twinging with pricks and needles as the breath of the thing behind the curtains came close as if to caress...  

I woke up again, jolted as if I had fallen into my bed. My heart in my mouth. I sat up and stared around me. The room looked normal -the same as it had in both previous dreams. My breathing began to slow and relief flooded through me. 

Before I had quite grounded myself back into reality, I heard the voice of my long-term partner saying comforting things. I was filled with relief and gratitude that they were there with me. I looked about to see where the voice was coming from, but they were not there. Instead I noticed a small thing sitting on a picture frame on my wall. It looked like a GI Joe toy, but with a monstrous inhuman face. The voice was coming from the toy as if prerecorded, saying lovely, comforting things, but the lips of the creature did not move. Its eyes did. I tried to ask the thing, “What do you want? What are you?” but as I opened my mouth, my body stiffened and sank slowly back to laying on my bed. I was back in the vise of paralysis. The voice of my partner turned cold, and the comfort had always been false. The creature descended, glided slowly down towards me, it’s face shifting and roiling, it’s eyes steady and filled with malice. The thing stood on my face and it was so much heavier than its size led me to expect. The ridged boot soles ground down into my cheek and forehead. I was still trying to ask the thing what it wanted, trying to converse with it, as it bent its head down lower. It’s face swelled and became massive, it’s true size. It bent down lower and lower into my face as I began to scream again. The thing put its whole mouth into my own soundless, sobbing one, and then bit down on my teeth. I felt the clash of its teeth on mine, horrid feeling, and my teeth broke in its jaws. Then it began to suck, sucking my broken teeth out and all my air. I could hear the teeth shards clattering in its throat, and all my air was sucked hard out of my lungs. There was no way to breathe, move or cry out. 

I woke again, this time for real. Even as I awoke though, I had one last hallucination of the overhead light in my room becoming an evil face, leering and swaying over me on a long white neck. It shrunk back up into itself and into an ordinary light. 

I cannot get these dreams out of my head. All day I have been turning them over in my mind. I don’t know what I’m looking for, I guess I just needed to get this out.

The surrounding environment was beautiful; like an open field but with blue grass, a nighttime sky, and fireflies circling around.

On and around the tree, I could hear children singing a beautiful song that I can still remember to this day. The melody itself was very deep and saddening; Similar to that from a short film called ""The Snowman"" (Walking in the Air).  In addition, the children were happy and at peace with each other.  None of them seemed above the age of 3 years old as they frolicked around.  Some even relaxed on the tree itself continuing to sing this beautiful melody.

I always found her physically attractive but the last time we hung out she came along to my best friends wedding as my date where I was best man. We got more attention than the couple to be wed, almost all other couples in age groups of all spectrums kept asking how long we were married for/dating etc. when we said we weren’t they couldn’t believe it. Our body language and flirtatious seeming nature made it obvious to others we just meshed well together. 

And that night, I fell head over heels for her. I guess everyone sensed that. She invited me to come stay with her for the night when she left since I was in from out of state for the wedding. I feel like she felt something different too, but I couldn’t leave my best friends wedding early. Maybe it was the wedding setting that did it? Either way, she was everything in my eyes that night. 

That was about a year ago. Since then we’ve become kind of distant. I’m not her type and it bothers me too much to see her on her self destructive path of dating the same pseudo-douche type.

Last night I had a dream I was visiting home again and wanted to call her so badly the whole time but my pride wouldn’t let me. An hour before my flight in the dream I caved and asked if I could come say goodbye.

I pulled up and she was on the front lawn, I picked her up by her hips as she jumped to embrace me at the same time. Feeling so real to me, I could feel the warmth of her body as my hands cusped the small of her back. With her hair covering my face and her scent pouring over me, I kissed her neck on the left side. As she let out a faint giggle I whispered that I’ve missed her so much, and I’m sorry I’ve been distant. 

We didn’t kiss in the dream, all I remember after that was going inside her house and seeing her dog. Dream over.

I can still smell her scent from the dream and feel her body, the weird thing is it’s not her scent in real life. 

I haven’t texted her or reached out at all in quite some time. I know she’s dating someone and will come back to say hello and complain about him in a few months when he inevitably breaks her heart.

Coincidentally, I had been awake for awhile, trying to remember everything I could about an epic and memorable dream I had had.

They're haunting and paralyzing. They're so precious to me.

It was nothing too horrible (meaning incredibly hardcore and sadistic, I suppose the nature of porn is wrong in itself.) Then I move one room over and there is a man sitting at a desk joined with the wall. Then a pretty young woman (must've been a late teen which) walks in. Next I aggressively grab her and begin touching her in extreme sexual ways. She is resisting at first but the more I touch her the more she stops resisting, as if she's aroused and giving it. I could include a detail about the touching, but I think I'll leave it all up to the imagination. It's around this time, by now I've unclothed her, that I find that the whole scene is being recorded and streamed. It seems to be some sadistic dark web stuff going on. Well I proceed to fully rape this poor young woman, who I'll add was a virgin, in a very brutal manner. The streaming ends with me leaving the room and the girl falling to the floor crying. Then the dream changed from me being in it to me viewing in through a screen (what appeared to be the dark web.) As I closed the tab that had the awful stream I just described, I see that there is another tab involuntarily open. This tab has was a deformed, grey, gangrel (almost alien looking) man watching me through the screen. I freak out and close the computer.

My husband told me that he had a dream about me almost a year before we met. We met online and he lived half and hour away from my town. Now, I have no idea how he can have a dream about me without seeing me while he is awake. We tried to rule out any possibilities. We never been to the same concert, or party, or event. We had no mutual friends ether.The website we met on, was fairly new and only had it for about a week before we began talking. After we met in person and hung out a couple of times, I met one of his friends. He starred me down for an unknown reason and said, ""She is the girl from that dream huh?"" I was very confused and I asked about it.

Apparently, after he was dumped by his fiancee he had a very vivid dream. It was like quick dating event but at a concert. You would be in the first room and do quick dates based off your mutual interest of music. Then if you hit it off you go into that concert. Our mutual band was The Misfits. After we paired, we got separated as we entered the concert. We later bumped into each other again as my husband was about to crowd surf. I slapped his butt and said ""Go get'em tiger."" At first I wasn't very shocked because it still can be any other girl who looks similar to me. Then he began to describe my outfit in detail. Remember, this was nearly a year prior to us meeting.

He described me with black hair and red long bangs, I had earrings that looked like screws, shorts with a flame pattern pockets, spiked military boots and a leather vest. But here is the thing, I didn't get my hair dyed until a day after we met, before it was a weird purple black color, the earrings were bought a month before we met, the pants originally didn't have pockets, it was the stupid fake ones, so I had to sew a bandanna that had fire flames on it to create pockets, I have had those for over a year, but turned them into shorts a month before as well. Also, I haven't worn them around him yet because we met during the spring and it was too cold. As for the spiked boots, I didn't own any until three months after we began dating, and they were a gift from my mom as well as the vest.

I remember this because I was walking by this car when it began ringing. No one was answering, so I broke in and picked up the phone. There was static, and then I heard a voice that sounded eerily like mine, but not quite. He asked me a few questions that only I would know the answer to. After obliging, there were a few moments of silence, and I hear ""...dad?""

I catch on pretty quickly. I'm ecstatic to be talking to him, and I try to ask as many questions as I can. I ask him what year it is, what his name is, how old he is, why he wanted to talk to me... but the boy was pretty tight lipped. His name is Anthony. I joked that I would have named him Adam, and asked if his name was Adam now (Ripple Effects and all). He sounded confused, and said ""you never named me, you weren't there.""

Fuck. This doesn't sound good.

I asked him who his mother was, and again, he didn't answer, only saying ""She told the doctor what to call me before she died.""

I ask him why he called me. Another moment of silence, and he says ""You never meet me. I wanted to call and tell you I made it without you.""

I start tearing up, saying how I would never abandon him, how I would love any kid I had, even if I had said on my 20th birthday that I would never have them. I would never resent them in any way. 

""I know, dad.""

I ask him if he ever knew me in the future, and he says the most chilling sentence I've ever heard. ""No. According to the records, you are hit by a car today. The accident leaves you in a coma for a few months. You told grandma and grandpa at some point that if you wouldn't wake up to just pull the plug . They love you, so they do.""

I ask him how much time I have left. He replies ""not long."" I try to open the car doors, but they're jammed shut. it dawns on me that this is the car that gets struck. I'm in my tomb. 

I tell him to give my love to everyone I knew, if they're still around.

""We're here, son"" Another voice answers from the back. ""We never had a chance to say goodbye.""

I'm crying so hard I'm incoherent, but I tell them that I love them with all my heart. I say my goodbyes to my family one by one, and then my son comes back on the phone.

""I love you, dad. They took good care of me. I'm going to be ok.""

The line goes dead. I still can't open the doors. I hear a semi horn blaring behind me, and I close my eyes. Then I woke up.

I'm still shaken. I have an exam in 4 hours, and I couldn't focus while this was still running around in my head. Hopefully this helps a little bit. I don't know. I just don't know.

For as long as I (19F) can remember, I've always had nightmares with everytime I dreamt. I'm pretty used to them now. But as i got older, they slowly started to become a mix of 2 of the most messed of forms of dreaming for me. A nightmare may lead into an extremely graphic and disturbing wet dream or a wet dream would start out then lead into a nightmare. 

This lastnight, the former is exactly what had happened. But worse. I'll try to keep it short. 

It started out with me as a kid. My baby cousin and I (my baby cousin not so much of a baby anymore but about the same age as me in the dream- age 5 or 6) were at my step dad's old trailer. My step dad is an extremely abusive man and with the things he's said and done to my family in the past, being back in this place terrifies me. My dream skipped around a bit and somehow I ended up on the couch laying on my back and watching tv. I was transfixed by whatever was on. Anyway, after a moment, my step dad takes a seat on the couch that I'm on. It's a teenage version of him. With knowing how he is, I move my feet off of the couch and sit up. My dream skipped around again but now, he's laying on top of me. I can't really move around or anything due to his weight but I can feel him moving and shifting from time to time as if he's trying to get into a good position. Skipping again, he's straddling me. I try my best to pay attention to what's on tv but I can't. I can both see and feel his ""thing"" on my stomach/lower abdomen. I try to use my tiny hand to move it off of me or out of the way but all he does is look at me and smile. My dream skips one more time and now he has it pressed against me, down there. He's mimicking pushing in and out of me.

I'll have to stop right here in order to get to my point and because I'm sure it's become unbearable for most readers. In the ""awake world"", i could actual feel all of this happening to me. I felt his thing pressed up against me. I felt it pushing against me. I can still feel what his thing felt like in my hand... But with me being the way I am, still walking out the back door of the puberty house, I could tell that parts of me actually enjoyed what he was doing. I hate to say it but i can't help but feel like its true.

But why? Do I have some fucked up suppressed memories of him? Or is there just something really wrong with me? 

I know i would never think about him in that way because as a kid i would write down tally marks on how many times I'd kill him eveytime he yelled me or my mother or hit me, not knowing that humans can only die once. But i do know that he's never done anything sexually abusive towards me or anyone in my family.

I just want some type of ""base"" or thought that i can set my mind on to ease all of this. This has had to have been the worst nightmare/wet dream and i hate myself so much right now.

0.0,ac11as,21.0,59.0,"Wow I just woke up from the most absurd dream I think I have ever seen. It was formed like a bollywood musical with song and romance and other shit. The villain of the movie was Satan but he was always running away and hiding from view. His nemesis was a young innocent girl who believed in God & tried to prove his existence to everyone. 

So satan lived on for years in disguise amongst people leading them on the path of sin but he was so afraid of being discovered that he could never be in his true form ( burly six pack but without any outer layer of skin , only red muscle visible) but god would occasionally walk the earth and no one would notice because he was dressed like a pauper and was so frail and short. 

In the final moments of the dream I witnessed a monologue that Satan was having with himself. He said that he denied his own existence in the world because he knew that if people actually believed in Satan then the majority of the world, (who was by this time atheist) would leave their belief and start believing in God. And since it would be an action with fear of Satan as a motivator for leaning on to god, then Satan would be wiped off the face of the earth. 

So he would rather deny his own existence and be able to influence a few people every day & lead them into crime & brutality . He feared power and being recognised because that would mean everyone rushing to God (in the beginning of the dream satan mentioned  everyone is inherently divine but had a great propensity for evil since most people are unaware of their own divinity) 

And as for god, he didn't want to end it & expose satan. God in the dream was unaffected by Satan and didn't want to end or expose him because God couldn't harm anyone, not even Satan because harm was not a divine quality but an evil one.

0.0,8p6dtw,23.0,58.0,"I'm 21 years old. I have always been aware that I was dreaming whenever I slept, and, when I was younger, it was so easy waking myself up whenever I dreamt of something unpleasant or had a nightmare. When it comes to death, like everyone else, I always woke up just before dying.

Over time, waking myself up has gotten significantly harder, so much to the point where, twice, I was stuck in my dream. The first time this happened I was 15 years old. I was in an endless loop: wake up, go to the bathroom, wet my face, look in the mirror, and think, _I'm still dreaming._ So I would shut my eyes for a couple of seconds to wake up, and then I would wake up, go to the bathroom, wet my face...

After the third time, I started to panic, constantly thinking, _I'm stuck in my dream. I can't wake up._

After the fifth or sixth time, I started to cry and ran to my figment mother and sister and told them that I was stuck dreaming and couldn't wake up. They, too, panicked, and guided me to my room where they performed a ritual. Our cat (RIP) slowly walked onto my chest and breathed some substance that looked like smoke into my mouth. My entire conscience shifted and I immediately woke up.

The second time was different (around 19 or 20 years old), and I only woke up with sheer mental force after a few minutes.

Last night was much different, as I have given up on trying to wake myself up and resorted to killing myself instead.

In my dream, an elitist sought to capture me to use me as a weapon. I was in hideout at the top of this god-like skyscraper, and when he got too close to capturing me, I jumped. I remember falling for what felt like forever while everything around me moved in a flash. Milliseconds before I crashed into the ground, I saw a person in front of me, and that was it. My entire being shut down—my body, my conscience, everything. I wasn’t even aware that I was dead, yet because I was dreaming, I knew that I died. Still unaware. I can’t even begin to explain it with accuracy. It was a totally different feeling from spacing out or falling asleep, because I didn’t _feel_ anything. Everything about me was just gone, and it was only until I arose in the same spot that I hit the ground did I realize that I died.

Does that make sense? I knew that I died only because I arose in my dream and only remembered the powerful impact of hitting the ground for not even a second, yet after the crash, I wasn’t aware of anything. 

I stopped being afraid of death when I no longer believed in a heaven/hell. For the most part, I believe that we just cease to exist, but sometimes I believe that our conscience transmits back to the stars (since we're made of stardust), completely forgetting this life while still having stored its memories within itself. I’ve only considered the possibility of our conscience traveling to another dimension or time after watching Interstellar a few years ago.

Not to stray off-topic, but I don’t know if my beliefs formed my dream of death or what, but all I know is that I completely ceased to exist when I died, and it just doesn’t feel real when I think about it. It doesn’t even feel like a dream. 

Anyone experienced something similar or may have an explanation to what happened? I don’t know if I completely died in real life (coma, maybe?) and in my dream, or just died in my dream. ",top,I officially died in my dream and didn’t wake up before actually dying.,58.0

So I was trying to get to sleep, and this was one of the first nights that my beautiful dog slept in my bed. He makes me really happy, so that might play a part in this. I became extremely relaxed, despite being in a normally uncomfortable position, and closed my eyes. Then I started to drift away.

  


I then saw this beautiful wheat field, a beautiful place, and to top it all off, it was a beautiful summer day with intermittent clouds, and the sun in high noon. A calm summer breeze swiftly blew on my face. It was the perfect temperature, akin to a calm walk in the park in the spring.

I looked up, and there was a beautiful sky, the blue gradient amazing my eyes. Fluffy white clouds hung up there, slowly moving away. The leaves of the nearby trees were shaking with the wind. I somehow looked at the sun.

If you've ever looked at a bright light, you know how when you look away, a purple color changing mark is left in your eyesight for a while. That happened to me for a second, as if this was real life. Then I quickly thought, ""Is this what heaven feels like?""

I then opened my eyes. I was in my bed, teleported back to reality. I felt so good.

This dream was extremely vivid and realistic, as if it was real life. I have never experienced such a surreal dream. This is something I will never forget.

I get a voice in my head like “good ur back!”  Then a flood of updated info about myself and the world, my name there, that we share a body but we are the same person. Just two different angles of the same person, like a parallel. I’m trying to keep my mind from getting too excited so I don’t wake up. 
This world is like ours but instead of just humans and animals, there are different strands of humanity. Like ethnicities In our world, but the human races there are kind of part human part something else like theyve evolved in that direction. Some have “powers” or abilities, some look a little different, some don’t have anything notably different about them at all. Similar to how ethnicities and physical features work here. This girl living in our shared body tells me that some humans in my world call us/me an angel,  because the energetic field that our bodies  produce to give us the ability to fly is perceived as wings bc they generate around our spine and branch out, “So in your dimension it can be seen physically”. I wish I remembered her name but she also told me she was 19 (I’m 22) in her world and showed me memories of our friends there and my house. I was like a little disappointed in the house bc she made it seem like we were kinda looked up to and “famous” in some way, but our house was very small and simple and didn’t have much in it. She explained it was bc in that world she didn’t like to be weighed down by too many materialistic things, she felt too grounded. I took it as a cliche characteristic of someone who could fly lol. 
So we recently made friends our neighbor. An older (German?) man who was also some kinda human hybrid whatever, he looked very human but his blue eyes had too much depth. He was slightly socially awkward, stared too much, and he had something about his personality I couldn’t put my finger on but was generally welcoming and friendly. I spent a lot of time with other people, so I was hanging out with him talking about the world and earth at his house when it started to rain. It was about dusk and the rain wasn’t too hard. The rain was another anomaly I found funny bc I would frequently switch between my human perspective and hers and in this world you could hear raindrops falling or thunder in the distance and could see things getting wet, but you couldn’t see the actual rain. Since I was from earth, I could see the raindrops. So I knew it was raining before my neighbor did and kept looking out the window saying I needed to get back to my house bc it was raining (probably acting how animals do before a storm). He smiled condescendingly. 
We were in his kitchen and I felt the token “bad guy is gonna make a move” in the dream feeling. The girl in my head said “that’s exactly what we’ve been sharing this existence for. I can’t mentally conceive some ideas like you can and I need help with this man.” I just needed to get out of his house and went to his sun room where I knew there was a window or door I could fly out of without crossing his path. The windows were locked and the door opened so I ran out to his front yard but got stuck there almost frozen just trying to wake myself up but it wasn’t working. I got this feeling of “it’s real!” But I know it couldn’t be real, so I’m stuck in this battle with myself. Trying to change things about the dream using  my lucidity, but only very minor things were changing like the amount of people outside and the time. At this point I’m panicked and exasperated because I can ALWAYS wake myself up. 
I go back into this mans house and stand in his sun room while he’s in his kitchen, a random woman is in his living room or of sight, but I get a mental image of her. She’s in a maroon skirt and blazer set with red hair and matching lipstick, the type of woman that looks angular and bossy and probably smells like cigarettes. The man is revealing his bad side and it’s essentially the part in this plot where the bad guy tells me his evil plan. But his is different, he says “I can tell by the way you’re struggling that you aren’t [My name in this dream world] you’re [My name in reality]”. I freeze, his eyes are glimmering, almost like there’s no pupil.. the girl in my head is rushing to feed me info about him and distract me from what he’s saying. Hes telling me that he’s sure I’m the earth version of me because I’m reacting differently, then he feeds me small details about my life in reality to convince me he knows who I really am, things that I can tell he’s picked up just listening to my conversations. He describes (with like telepathic mental images as well) real life memories I have as a little girl with my best friend doing things like looking at a tadpole that we caught, he’s telling me that he knows me on earth too..
 The girl in my head is telling me he can move things with his mind, but I’m literally flooded with FEAR and this internal battle of what if this isn’t a dream, I’m not listening. He’s walking closer to me and the rain stopped, grey light is shining through the windows on the ceiling of the sun room. The windows! I fly up towards them and am confronted by chicken wire that turns purple as I touch it. This girl in my head feeds me this real memory I have. I’m in my real room, alone, waking up at like 5pm, trash and clothes everywhere. Blue dusk-like light is filling the room and it just looks empty. I feel her expressing something like she’s surprised at how dirty it is, and then me thinking that this is what a depression episode looks like. I’m thinking to myself about my childhood and how I’d take dried seahorses from my grandmas computer room, put them in the sink, and let the water run over them for awhile. Knowing that this wasn’t scientifically possible to bring them back to life, but also kinda having enough faith in myself that maybe if I really really felt like they would come back to life then they would. They never did and I ended up ruining them most of the time, but I always wrote the fail off as a little bit of doubt still left in my mind tainting the experiment. As I laid in bed I thought, “that’s the whole point isn’t it. You just need to really envision it and feel it 100% and whose to say it won’t happen in some way. 
The girl in my head literally gives me the feeling of “!!!!!!!!!!” Lol. I fly up towards the windows again to attempt to feel myself going through the wire and breaking out. The man is coming back with a black shotgun. He shoots, just missing me and I notice that there are no bullets coming out yet something still blows past me. I’m seriously trying to envision moving through this wire still, breaking it down to how the material would feel going past and around my skin, feeling the fresh air from outside. I break my hand through and I hear the gun being cocked again. The girl in my head tells me “wake up NOW” and I hesitate until I look down and see the man has a perfect aim towards me. He’s going to hit me. I wake myself up, with no problems this time.

0.0,4hp7ie,0.0,54.0,"I was just cruising around with my cousin in my town, driving over the bridge and then back, just talking about whatever. I haven't seen him in a while, so I guess my brain just wanted me to see someone I miss. After a while of driving, my cousin started having malfunctions. He started making fine points turns at a very open stop sign. This is where I started to figure that something was going on and that I wasn't in real space.

After two minutes of his malfunction, I realized I was in a room with two couches and a mirror. I was confused by how quickly the setting changed and I just knew it wasn't real. I felt dazed like I was transported there unwillingly.The feeling of your body and mind travelling to a different space, all within the same time. Trippy. Did someone drug me somehow? Impossible due to the fact I was JUST driving with my cousin. I stood up and walked around the room, inspecting both the 3 seated couch(where my cousin was located) and the 2 seated couch that I awoke upon. I was still very confused, speaking incoherently to my cousin who just opened his eyes. He didn't seem as dazed as I did.

There was this wood door that was cracked open every so slightly, just barely being able to see through. It had character like it's been there for a while now. It was just old. I had this feeling that I was being watched. It felt real that I was in this room, but what I saw through the crack swayed me otherwise. Mannequins. There were mannequins? With clothes on placed throughout what seemed like a living room. Three, four, maybe five of them.. it was still hard to see. I was talking to my cousin to try to understand a little more of what was going on and I asked him if I was dreaming and I was thinking hard for him to say ""Yes, this is a dream"" but he didn't say anything. It was whatever I felt, but then all of a sudden I was back on the couch. 

I was there again. The couch. I got back up and started inspecting the two couches and the mirror. The fake mirror. I've seen enough to spot a see through mirror. Who was watching us? Who put us here? Are the mannequins still there? I took a peek and this time someone was walking around the mannequins and I heard a deep, low voice speaking words I couldn't understand. It was English, but I just couldn't understand. I closed my eyes for a few moments, sitting on the couch, telling myself to wake up but it came to no avail. I was still in the room. But when I opened my eyes, there was a needle and string under the skin of my ring finger. I was shocked at how quickly that happened. About 4 inches of string through my finger, with a knot at one end and the needle still attached. I tried to pull it through but I knew it wouldn't work, but I tried anyways. The knot was restricting me from pulling it and I didn't dare try pulling the needle through. How the hell did this happen in just a few moments when I was trying to wake myself up? I went back to my cousin to show him my finger and he was also shocked. I didn't feel any pain, I only whinced when the string was pulled back and forth under my skin. The hole was real, as I could see through it. The color of the string was red and I wasn't bleeding. 

I closed my eyes again and screamed in my head to wake me up, hoping so badly that I wasn't stuck in this dream. That I NEEDED to wake up and that if I didn't soon, I was going to lead myself to believe I was trapped in this dream space for eternity. Or maybe I was just knocked unconscious and this is what it's like to be in a coma. Maybe my cousin crashed his car and that's when the malfunctions started. It seemed to work, telling myself to wake up, so I tried again and my vision got blurry as I was slowly waking up in a different room. My room? Or another dream space? I saw the Steam logo, but kept doing it. I was half on the couch and half looking over at a TV screen. Wake up, please, I kept thinking to myself. I can't be trapped in this room. I screamed once more in my head, ""WAKE UP!"", and I woke with blurry vision and 100% confused..in my bed. With the digital clock telling me it was 7:22. ",top,The couch,54.0

But it's weird, cause that only seems to go for conscious thoughts. When we were running, the one roommate I wouldn't have expected to keep up was a bit ahead of me, and i pushed to catch up, *then he challenged me to a race* (though that might've been because I was miffed he beat me cause I wasn't really going for speed but for longevity and wanted a race to prove myself lol), then started racing in the opposite direction, then some rando superhero lookin guy was in that race. I won but I pushed so hard I ended up jerking myself awake lol

I've noticed this works for lucid dreams too. If I think ""I wanna fly"", nothing happens, but if I think, ""I'm prolly about to fly"" it does.

0.0,8o79qo,13.0,57.0,"This happened mid-March. One day I fell asleep around 10 AM...woke up at 11 AM, checked my phone and decided to go back to sleep. This is a clarified/expanded on version of the description I wrote immediately after I woke up.

I dreamt that I was at this meditation/dimensional travel seminar, where you learn to use meditation and some kind of signal to jump between dimensions. Similar to using mindfulness/meditation to put yourself in a calm state of mind. Mine was holding my right-hand thumb and pointer finger in the “ok” signal (👌🏻), tapping it against my leg 3 times, snapping my fingers quickly (on the half-beat) and then tapping it against my leg once more. (It was like 1-2-3-ah-4, the numbers being when I tapped my hand against my leg and the ‘ah’ being the snap)

Anyway we had a whole discussion about practicing your signal to make sure you can do it perfectly every time because even slight deviation could either have no result or send you to the wrong destination/create a ‘glitch’ that could trap you between dimensions or across multiple ones. He also mentioned that jumping dimensions could trigger headaches or a twinge/feeling of pressure and odd body sensations/sounds but that it wasn’t anything to worry about. 

We had more discussion about the nature of signals and alternate dimensions/universes, meditated, practiced, and mingled with our classmates. Eventually, the time came to actually test our signals. Before we started, the instructor warned us that we might accidentally wake up while testing our signals and that it just meant that we jumped back to our waking dimension and our signals worked. 

On my last try, I got an intense feeling of pressure (like my head was expanding and being squeezed at the same time), heard this loud, all-encompassing whooshing/zapping/buzzing/white noise sound. It felt like I had been launched out of a slingshot, and then my body started shaking, and suddenly my eyes popped open and I was fully conscious in my bed. I ached and felt all numb, like when you wake up before your body does and can’t quite move yet. I spent a good few minutes processing what had just happened. It felt like I had been sleeping for hours, but when I checked my phone it was only just past 11:30. 

I’m sure it was some manifestation of sleep paralysis/has some deeper or hidden meaning but it freaked me out and made me ponder reality for a few minutes.

0.0,8c6ido,15.0,56.0,"I have no idea if it's normal or not, but I can remember dreams from twenty, thirty years ago  with places or people I still 'see' to this day. Most of them happen in the same town, often enough that I have a vague map in my head -- landmarks and routes, highways and surface streets, even the floorplan of the local shopping mall. I know the wooded outskirts, with the small river that runs between it and the town, and the lush greener areas along it where the nicer homes are. I know the little mom-and-pop stores near the center of town, and the second-hand shops, and the movie theater. I know the bridge of the highway where it crosses the mouth of the river where it meets the ocean has the best view in the whole city. I know the workers at all my favorite stores, the best restaurants in town, and that the pink-and-orange-striped ice cream in the department store's cafe is their tastiest flavor (though I have no idea what flavor it actually *is*).

But they're all places I've never been to in real life; the city in my dreams isn't even close to anywhere I've actually lived, or even visited. The people are practically strangers to my waking self -- I wouldn't know who they are if they came to life and stood right in front of me.

But in my dreams, I know them. I'm never 'me', it's never a first-person type dream. It really is like watching a show, stepping back and just seeing what happens to everyone around me entirely in third-person. As far as I know, the events never reoccur, even though I've been watching this city and its inhabitants in my dreams for nearly three decades now. Part of me wants to ask if this is normal, but eh.

0.0,9c2529,19.0,57.0,"Like Owl said, dreams tell you a story, and you need to put the pieces together. 

A better way I like to put it is that a whole meaningful dream is a sentence and individual sentences are words. 

Exactly like in grammar class, taking words out of context changes their meaning. A mistake I often see when some people analyze dreams is assume a specific dream symbol or dream scene is the whole meaning. That could only happen in seemingly meaningless information processing dreams, usually not happening in the middle of your sleep or in REM sleep, where the dream doesn't have a storyline and is just random scenes and images, then you can guess each individual one as ""My brain processes *whatever symbol means* from the previous day"". 

If the dream *has* a coherent storyline then it must be analyzed like a sentence (put in context). Take for example, a recent dream one of my friends had: In one scene a forest is burning and buses on fire are in it. That alone means a ruined social life, but shall not be interpreted as ""my social life is ruined"" but as ""my ruined social life"". Turn from verb into noun. Then analyze the rest of the dream and put it in context, maybe the sentence would end up being ""My previously ruined social life is now better"" or ""My social life will be ruined if I do a certain thing"" etc. 

This is another reason why 90% of ""dream interpretations"" you find on Google are absolutely stupid; You can't take any random dream symbol out of context and then tell the dreamer its overall meaning ""Dreaming of snakes in a dream means dealing with a difficult situation or unsettling emotions in your waking life"", that's stupid. Instead transform that into ""a difficult or unsettling emotion in your waking life"" then put it in context with the rest of the dream, take each symbol, find out each word and take all the words and make a sentence, or more sentences: Maybe the meaning is ""a difficult or unsettling emotion in your waking life is gone""? You never know.

The dream: everything was pitch black, and the only thing I saw were the piano keys and my hands, which had scabs and small holes, from which I could see the inside of my hands. The reflection from the piano itself showed me scabs and holes on my face as well, exposing my teeth, jawbone, etc. I was getting scared because I noticed that I couldn't control myself. It was like I was in someone else's body, and watching through their eyes. It was me though, just with no control over anything my body was doing. I started playing, my hands moving across the piano swiftly and without hesitation like I had been playing the instrument all my life. I experiencing multiple emotions: Sad, angry, missing my ex, and many more that I can't explain. The song was so beautiful and complex that I started crying.

0.0,1u5oz9,2.0,55.0,"Last night I had one of the most coherent, awesome dreams of my life. I was living in an episode of the anime Dragon Ball Z. It appeared to be a filler episode in which the characters were vacationing at the character Bulma's summer cottage, which looked like my grandmas house transplanted to the edge of a desert. Vegeta, crown prince of Saiyans, was getting antsy having to just sit around with nobody to fight. When Bulma told him to calm down, he went on a tirade about how everyone should be more grateful of his contributions, as it was his ""Saiyan gold"" which bought the house we were staying at. Vegeta began telling a story about how long ago, before his home planet was destroyed, he had wealth beyond any creature in the galaxy. Luckily, his riches were held in an off planet bank vault only accessible by a touch from his royal Saiyan DNA. Once on earth, with his son Trunks old enough to travel the galaxy, Vegeta left for a brief time to show his kin where the space vault lay at the edge of the galaxy. Once within, the two found a group of deadly aliens that looked like the character Frieza. They quickly dispatched them, carried the hoard of Saiyan gold onto their ship and proceeded back to earth where they flew through Christmas Eve skies tossing gold to all of their DBZ character friends in a somewhat cheesy montage.

I had three equally vivid dreams during three periods of interrupted sleep this morning. The last is now the only one I remember.

((My friends and I sat down at a restaurant and ordered some food. I briefly met the manager and he was extremely friendly and chatty. I was starving and really wanting my country fried steak with mashed potatoes. The waiter - a built man in his 30s - brings out our food but then, for whatever reason, informs me that I need to pay for my meal now via an iPad like device that requires answering 20 complicated questions. I said ""okay, I will simply eat my steak and then I'll happily pay.""

""Nope,"" he said. ""You need to do it now.""

I go to take a bite of my steak, and he pushes it back and then places his arms like seat belt straps on both sides of my chair so I can't move. I become, understandably, irate - but my friends encourage me to just get it over with. I struggle against this man's arms, frozen at my sides, and I finally begin the complex iPad questionnaire. It contained questions like, ""if you were to run your own restaurant, what specific standards would you enforce in the kitchen?""

I'm angry and shaking with hunger and finding it impossible to complete this questionnaire. The man persists, after 15 or so minutes I am done. When I go to eat my steak - it's cold! I ask the waiter if he can reheat it for me and he gives an unequivocal no. So I get my ass up and wander around the now huge restaurant trying to find another waiter or chef who can help me. Everyone refuses. I start to feel so angry I can't contain it. I rant about how awful this restaurant is, how no one should ever be treated this way.

Then I see the very friendly manager - a guy with long hair who resembled ""Sam"" from TruBlood - and I tell him what just happened. He smiles and asks me to come with him through the employee-only door. I'm happy my problem is finally resolved, but then I see that we're walking back to the parking lot behind the restaurant. I feel a little nervous. He asks me to get into the backseat of his car. Now I feel real nervous.

I sit down and he begins to unzip my pants (somehow he was able to squat in front of me inside the back passenger area (the greatest impossibility in this whole dream)). Then, out of nowhere, he's Donald Trump. Disgusting, scowling, flat-headed Donald Trump. And he starts giving me head (I really don't wanna be graphic but I don't think reddit is for children).

The weird part was, he liked to suck just the very top of my thing really hard. He was sweaty, creepy and making loud suction noises. In the end, I decided to just focus and get it over with, and tried to concentrate on finishing.

But I woke up before I finished. Probably the only time in history that was a good thing.

0.0,abqy3n,10.0,52.0,"Just the other night I had one of the wildest dreams of recent memory, and felt the need to post it. So here it is. Sorry if my writing gets repetitive. 

So I found myself going to some casino-styled building charging people to let them go back in time for a designated amount of time based on how much they paid. However, there was one aspect of this travel that was never mentioned by the providers of this service that I'll talk about later. 

The corporation reinsured that these journeys to the past would not effect the present day, and would instead branch off into different timelines. After a long wait, I was able to try it for around an hour and continued to do it again and again until I ran out of the money I was using for time travel. 

I begged them to allow me to try it again. I don't remember too many details of this specific portion, but I do remember eventually being sent back centuries before the time I had specified. I attempted to find a place to stay until I eventually found one welcoming home. 

There was a makeshift family of previous travelers staying in the home that were either stuck in the time period or staying hidden from whatever tech was used to send them back to the present. This also means they had access to the said tech, which will become important later. 

These people are what I mentioned previously that was never talked of by the providers of the service; stragglers that were left behind in different time periods. It was easy to tell which of them were finding their footing and which of them had been stuck for a long time. While some of them still had knowledge of the present day, others had completely forgotten about modern technology and were pretty much one with the time period. Later that night, they did some kind of ritual where they gave me a bulky necklace to welcome me into their makeshift family. 

This relationship didn't last long, as I soon found myself back at the station for time travel. Apparently something had just went wrong and I had been stuck longer than I was meant to be. I just assumed that those said stragglers wouldn't mind that I had left them and so I went along with my daily routine. 

I eventually met up with a girl that I now do not recall being based on anyone I actually know in the real world, whom was hoping to go back in time to a school dance some time in the 1900s to see what was different back then (yes, I'm probably younger than most of you). I agreed to go with her. 

So we went back and tried to find somewhere to stay (seem familiar?) when eventually that makeshift family I was previously staying with tracked me down and told me how I had betrayed their customs and had already worn the necklace that made me part of their 'family'. Apparently they had used the same technology used by the corporation in order to make sure the necklaces they created tracked those who wore them, and of course I had never bothered to take mine off. 

They proceeded to state that due to this custom, I was now forced to stay with them in their time period. At this point I thought of them as delusional and as they gave chase, I was forced to return to the present day leaving the lady behind in the process. The realization that I left her behind struck me and made me realize that I would have to somehow explain to her family how their daughter was now nonexistent in this time period, but I did not have much time to stress over this issue as the delusionals had already tracked me down once again to the present day. 

I should probably explain the reasoning behind all this. With the amount of time they had been stuck in the time period, they had the ability to research the said tech and make use of it. Alongside the tracking abilities, the 'family' utilized the time travel portion of it to create rifts in time in order to track down the people that disobeyed them and eventually force them to stay in the said time period. 

With the delusionals closing in on me, I rushed to travel once again back to the same time I had traveled to previously in order to warn myself of the impending doom. 

Sadly, this was as far as I got and so there is no complete storyline. I hope this was an interesting read nonetheless!

0.0,abnuix,15.0,50.0,"there was a moment I felt like reality glitch and repeated a short loop. and I couldn't move. I actually tried screaming out for help during that moment. I guess I had sleep paralyses. and you know how time is relative. And technically going backwards in time is possible in physics. and time effects well time is really spacetime and its spacetime that is relative. and if you look at quantum mechanics. which physics of the small. and spacetime and movements of the planets is  trigonometry special relatively. is all still technically physics of the big. 


Science has yet to connect build a bridge between physics of the small to the physics of the big. 


moreover the fact that their maybe multiple universes and not just one universe just more the reason why reality may be fake. well what science say instead is that their is a likelihood that we are inanimate objects well they simulations. but technically simulated things are not alive aka artificial intelligence. 


the reason why scientist be like maybe in another universe your a killer etc is because scientist believe that all things are physics meaning all the biological particles the biological systems ever synapses in your brain. it all had a cause and reaction. just like the plannets in the solar system their is math that can determine where and how planets move. and by theory its possible to do that for every particle in the universe. 



so by theory if we had a big enough computer aka super computer we can simulate the universe. this is what scientist mean by simulation.  and the reason why they say its likely we are in a simulated one and not the real universe because of how long the universe existed. and the fact that their may be multiple and the fact that a advance civilization may have already achieved this huge super computer to simulate a universe. 



and the reason why they say advance hums may simulate a universe is because it we are currently during. with Virtual reality etc. 



so the questions that arise is. but first scientist think that free will may be a illusion because of what I describe before. every particle in the universe was set in motion since the big bang. therefore we are so to.



so the main question would be how would we know we are in a simulation and not the real universe. you may think that should be easy to found out. say if you were a video game character how would you know in a video game? lets keep that in mind for what i'm going to say next. 



we all are in a video game. we use science to figure out about this video game. we take things apart we keep doing so till we can't anymore. for example discovering the atom. then we go deeper discovering we can split the atom then deeper. 



but we will hit a point where we can't investigate any further. and why is that? 



im getting off topic well off focus. just dreams sometimes are to normal and rational. say if we could prolong a dream how would we know its not reality. would you check the time on your phone. or what? 


the only way to know its a dream is to wake up.


the only way to know were in the matrix is to get out. 


this is something ancient philosphers may have never talked about but they always did talk about a creator a god and they also talk about if their is no god. but what does that mean by no god. it means that simulation is a viable truth and have likelihood to be true. 


but lets go to metaphysical. I find it always like frustrating about who and what am I. if I lose my arm am I me still what about my arm. if my mind gets wipe completely am I still me?



this is where the idea of the soul comes from.  that's something that always been talked about since ancient times. 



there no proof of a soul yet. like does a clone have a soul? 


but about Dreams lets just say its connected to the spiritual universe and technically everything is connected to the spiritual universe. 



and lets say the spiritual universe dictates probability. like a algorithm that can happen and not happen 



but universe and reality is weird if I could move at the speed of light far away then comeback here. everything here on earth will age when I have barely age a few years. GET ME? 

how is that for crazy, 



but dreams need more scientific study, because there were moments where I felt just to illustrate my point s I felt I could open a door to the true reality but I was very afraid too. and I said to myself no I don't wanna go I'm a stay where its more pleasant.



I felt I maybe would of gone crazy if I did so like not be able to comeback. I still kinda feel like reality does not exist. with mandlea effect and all. and like certain things happen and its hard to believe its a coincidence but its these unique momments that stand out to you always because its reoccurring much like a a.i algorithm or computer algorithm.



but I want full dive technology I believe dreams is the way to do that. also I think the soul needs to be discovered or created and I think quantum mechanics is the way to do that because of ""entanglement"" in quantum mechanics there is a particle in superpostion its both forward in time and back wards in time I believe and our soul needs to have that ability or brain is not what should have that ability because its dies. our soul should ideally not die.  but they say energy never dies  ",top,DREAMS make feel like reality is fake,50.0

About 2.5 years ago, I went to sleep last night and dreamt of this really weird place. A big place, a city with suburbs. 

Since that night, every time I sleep, I return to this place.

Random/weird details: 
 - Landscape of the dream is generally familiar in terms of trees and water and rocks and buildings and roads, but the actual place is nowhere like anywhere I have ever been or seen
 - Public transport is weird and different. Trains don't operate in conventional ways. I think maybe they use some kind of magnetic energy because the carriages hover above the rails. Main/central stations are also designed completely differently, more fitting with the way the ""trains"" are designed
 - there is no advertising anywhere outdoors. It seems as though businesses can advertise only within their own premises, and there seem to be size restrictions on how big physical advertising is. 
 - have never watched TV in this place 
 - I have a job in this place. I'm not 100% sure what it is I do, but I seem to spend time assessing public areas for general safety, and spend the rest of my time working with other people to mitigate any potential threats to the people who live there. 
 - I have a car. It's silver, I'm pretty sure it's a work car, and it doesn't operate the same way that cars do as we know them. It's really hard to explain. Close to driverless, but intentionally still engaging the driver in its operation. 
 - I don't have my own house. I spend most of my time staying with people I don't know 
 - society is really communal. Everyone spends lots of time outdoors, engaging in organised events or making use of public facilities as their primary form of social interaction. 
 - festival-type things occur every week. Huge events with something for everyone. Generally safe, though there are some instances of violence. Not a huge focus on preventative safety...some accidents have occurred occasioning in death in these festivals, and the accidents have been mostly down to poor planning
 - I have some favourite places to go. There is a spot with an amazing view at certain times of the day. Its a little hard to get to by car...but you can do it, and it's worth it. 
 - i have some favourite shops, but almost never buy anything. 
 - I go on the occasional holiday. The holiday is proximate to where the rest of the dream occurs, so i'm not going far.
 - I sometimes (rarely) dream in the dream. I dream about my real life, but where all the details are really augmented. In my dream, I know I am dreaming about my ""other"" life
 - I cannot control my dream, or lucid dream. I am completely immersed in the dream and its details when I am dreaming. It is as strongly my reality in that moment as the moments I experience when I am awake. 

Very rarely do I interact with ""real life"" people in this dream place. Once I met my sister. I told her about this odd dream interaction a few days after it happened, and to my horror she was able to finish telling me my own story, filling in all the details (layout of places, colours, what I was doing in the dream) with a genuinely uncomfortable level of accuracy. 

Mostly what gets me is the feeling I am left with when I wake up. I've learnt to deal with it a little better, but for at least 18 months it would take me a decent 20 minutes every time I woke up to really comprehend what is real and what was a dream. This place is so insanely real. INSANELY REAL. I've just about gone nuts trying to rationalise the intense reality of these dreams, from ""omg am I astral projecting?"" to ""omg - i discovered a parallel universe!"" to ""omg im clearly an alien or god-like creature hybrid and my brain is connecting to the universe"" to ""omg im clearly having some type of mental break-down"" to ""omfg why why why why!!! I just spent all day working and now i am going to sleep and go to work again WTF"" to ""hmm wonder what i'm sleep-checking out at sleep-work tonight"". 

At various points in the past 2.5 years, I have woken up so tired from my ""dream"" that all I can do is cry. And then live life#2. 

I've kind of gotten used to it, but I still find it really exhausting and often crave for a normal dream. 

Anyone else?

EDIT: forgot about this til now. In the beginning, for about 4-6 months I would, once or twice a week, dream as a man (I'm a female, as am ""I"" in the dream usually). When I am the man, I am basically a labourer. I put up fencing (both permanent & temporary event fencing, if anyone is interested). From the moment I slept, til the end of ""his"" day, I would work. It was freaken' exhausting. Hat's off to actual labourers. Some nights, if I slept long enough, the dream would continue past knock-off, and ""I"" would go home, sit on the balcony of this weird sharehouse ""I"" lived in (never met my housemates). It had a mostly wrap-around balcony, and there was this old upholstered recliner I would sit in, and just enjoy the shade of the trees around the balcony. Occasionally, a random dog with a blue bandana collar would wander around the permitter of the property. He would communicate with me telepathically. He didn't like small children. He was old, pretty chilled out, but definitely a lone wolf kind of dog. 
Anyway. Nights where I was the man, I would always wake up the next morning utterly exhausted. 

TL;DR - 2.5 years dream in the same place which isn't actually real. Have a job, a life, feels as real life feels when I'm awake. One-time creepy cross-over with my sister.

In October of 2011, I had a very interesting dream. In my dream, I heard a voice, but it wasn't an audible voice. It was more of a thought. In other words, I heard someone speak to me via thoughts. I didn't hear anything, but I knew what was said. I know... it's a bit weird. I also knew that it was God speaking to me. I""m not sure how I knew that, but somehow I knew. The voice told me that my wife was pregnant and that we were going to have a son. This whisper also told me that we should give him a middle name Patrick because that's my wife's maiden name. The reason why it was important for his middle name to be Patrick because my father-in-law always wanted a boy and he ended up with 3 girls. So God told me that this would bring great joy to my father-in-law. I also saw a little girl in my dream and God told me to be careful with her. He showed me a visual of me being a bit harsh with her and he wanted me to see how she felt when I was being harsh. I remember seeing her being very sad and that did it for me. I woke up right after the dream and I decided to wake my wife up to tell her the dream. Right after I told her my dream, she looked at me weird and said: ""You know, just this week I told God that I'll keep one last pregnancy test and after that, I'm done worrying about it"". Minutes later my wife decided to use her last pregnancy test. I remember that moment like it was yesterday. It was about 3 or 4 in the morning and I remember it being a bit cold, dark, and very peaceful. She went into the bathroom to do the urine test. A few minutes later my wife came out of the bathroom and she asked me to look to see what it said because she was too afraid to be disappointed once again. I looked down and it was a bit hard to see what the pregnancy test said because of the low light. I saw double lines and I asked my wife what it meant. She thought I was joking and asked me to stop playing games. I told her that I wasn't and next I saw tears running down my wife's face. It was definitely happy tears. She told me that it meant we were going to have a baby. It was the most beautiful moment of my life. We were both sitting on a cold bathroom floor in the dark crying our eyes out. Months later we found out that we were going to have a son and we ended up giving him middle name Patrick. Also, two years later we had a girl.

What was interesting about the whole thing is that during the pregnancy my father-in-law ended up having his 4th heart attack and it looked like he wasn't going to make it. But for some odd reason, I had peace in my heart because I knew that God wanted for my father-in-law to enjoy our son and he had to be alive for that. He ended up surviving the heart attack and today he lives with us in the same house.

The light coming from the window was a very bright white and looking through it I could see I was high up in the air.

My family was visiting this really old building. Victorian era? Inside the building and in the basement was “Reddit”. Reddit was a different in my dream. It was a room filled with PO Boxes everywhere. Different sizes. There was many employees on old computers. 

In this version of Reddit, you can order a “PO Box” based on your interest and you would be sent it (I guess like how you have certain interest In subreddits?) 

I remember this really freaky looking box. An employee told us that was a demon box. It was worth a lot but you don’t want to open it

It was kinda like Mystery Boxes meets the dark web, but it was Reddit

Anyways an employee was having trouble opening a box for an order, the key wasn’t working, my mom took out a lighter and held it beside claiming she saw a video saying this is how you can open a lock

Next thing I know the boxes started catching fire. We all evacuated immediately after panic of trying to diffuse the fire. It spread too quickly though. 

We left the Reddit building as the fire trucks came. The police let us go but I knew that everyone on the Reddit website would talk about this. Major news. And they were all going to blame my mom. My poor mom. I got really sad. Yeah she started it but didn’t mean to burn the building down.

They started by injecting some dye into my body, and said that because my dad was a big, tough, military man, that this would probably hurt me more than the average person. I was like, ""Uhh..."" because they were already doing it. Too late to say no now, a warning would have been nice. Anyway, it didn't hurt and I was fine.

Later on, I was up, and they were having me look at this bag of cards. Each card had either a texture or an instruction. My job was just to touch each one and let myself feel whatever it made me feel, or think whatever memory or idea it brought up. So for hours I'm in this room, with a tv for music, doing this little test, laughing and crying by myself.

The lady came back in in the afternoon, and was like, ""You're doing great, we're learning a lot about your brain and how it works!.""  I was all, ""Thanks, I know.""

So the dream got weird with the tv. I was trying to find new music and the channels got all wonky, and I got pieces of a Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder movies that don't exist. I think it was ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape 2 in Spanish"" and some other movie I didn't recognize.

0.0,3e82bm,96.0,53.0,"Good afternoon.  my name is Ian Wilson and I've spent the last 26 exploring the dreamstate through lucid dreaming.  In 1989, an article written by Dr. Stephen Laberge entitled, ""Power Trips: Controlling your Dreams""  http://www.sacred-texts.com/bos/bos220.htm .  This article in an Omni magazine introduced me to the idea of lucid dreaming, and at 15 years of age the idea of controlling the dream and being awake during it fueled my curiosity and enthusiasm.  What happened next was a life changing event when lucid dreaming started to spontaneously pop up.

Through this new vehicle of dream exploration new and unexpected events occurred which shocked and rattled world when some dreams  started to come true.  In 1991 I would have my first lucid precognitive dream which took this precognitive element through dreaming to a new level and it would be through lucid precognitive dreaming that I experienced a new type of causality where I could change the dream content during the initial precognitive dream, and those changes would later occur in my waking life when the dream came true.

More recently, precognition helped save me from a terrible car accident which has helped inspire me to advocate for precognition as an important human potential that we should all endeavor to explore.

Other strange anomalous events also cropped up such as encountering friends during a lucid dream to find out upon waking that they would remember the encounter through their own dreams.  This potential to see the future and share dreams came through the act of having such experiences and hinted at a much larger opportunity then what lucid dreaming itself presented.
Since then, I've written a paper entitled, ""The Theory of Precognitive  Dreams""  http://www.youaredreaming.org/assets/pdf/Theory_Of_Precognitive_Dreams.pdf and a book entitled, ""You Are Dreaming""  http://youaredreaming.org/assets/pdf/YouAreDreaming_04252013.pdf to help other like minded Oneironauts have the tools and insights into the exciting potential that lurks within the dreamstate.

In addition to shared dreaming and precognition, I have experienced time stretch where the amount of time dreamed exceeded the amount of time physically slept.  This increased time  through dreaming can equal days to as much as two weeks of lucid dream experience before waking up.  I call these mini-vacations and although rare are wonderful and welcomed side effects of lucid dreaming.

There is a huge potential for new experiences and discovery through lucid dreaming and I feel I've only scratched the surface of a much larger system which we are all actively participating in but not necessarily consciously.  I've brought a lifetime of knowledge and experience to this AMA so feel free to ask any question you have regarding dreams.

0.0,8oz1cl,48.0,47.0,"*EDIT: I want to be clear that this dream was not just that I saw someone who I may later find in real life (that has happened to me before). The difference is she was fully autonomous, robust in character, conscious that she too was in a dream, sad when the dream was about to end, and insisted she existed in real life and that I might be able to find her.*

So this is going to sound crazy but I've never had a dream like this in my life in which I connected so strongly to a person. For background I am F, bi, in my 20's but have never been with a woman (so there is a lot of repressed sexuality there due to religion etc.).

Anyway, last night I had a very pleasant dream as follows. I start off in a country bungalow type kitchen (open, airy, white, but small and has that old feel to it, like a grandma's). Sitting at a small kitchen nook is a woman of medium weight, with blond hair, both larger and taller than I am. I wouldn't say she is super hot but I am drawn to her. She is wearing a black slinky type dress and opens her legs just slightly enough so I can see she has no panties on. Obviously this turns me on and I go to her and she pulls me in for a kiss (usually, I am more assertive so this also tended to take me by surprise). I go with it and tell her to come to the next room. The other room is like a small gym/yoga room with an old boombox in it. I turn the music on and begin dancing super silly. We are dancing, having fun, kissing (but not more) another girl enters the room interrupting (I can't recall about what) and we sort of blow her off although I think she stays in the room. Now I am in complete bliss with this woman, as if fully and happily in love and lust. We are acting like silly kids listening to music. 

Then she sits down on the floor to relax (there are gym mats all over). I sit down next to her and she has some chex-mix (I haven't eaten it in years due to severe allergies). I somehow eat them and realize that I am in a dream because they cannot affect me. It is delicious and heavenly and I indulge. Something clicks in my head very clearly that it is a dream and she too is just part of my dream. Yet I cannot accept she is fake since she seems so real. In that moment I thought perhaps I had even died and been destined to her.

Anyway, I look at her and say, ""I know this is going to ruin all this, but we're in a dream. And I need to know if you exist for real."" She denies it is a dream, but then admits it must be, but that she is indeed real. I could tell the lucidness was starting to fade, so I asked her how I could find her in real life then. She said her name is Kat and she is from New Orleans. I then shared my first name (which is a bit obscure). By then I felt a bit panicked as the dream kept fading in and out, so I was sort of trying to embrace her and said, ""but what's your last name so I can find you after this?"" She just shook her head repeatedly as if she was about to cry. I said, ""please, just tell me so I can find you."" But she was too distraught. In my head I thought the last name might be Skinner or something but I didn't have time to ask her. The dream ended and I was very upset I didn't get more info. on her.

the beggining of the dream was weird. turns out it was a set up to knock me down. 

i was emailing someone who apparently told me something she didnt want to get out, that the story did get out, but it wasnt me who leaked it.  just a quick fyi email. ? idk, it didnt seem all that important. 

so, after i send the email i go to use the bathroom but since thats my brothers chore it had not been done in a while it was completely puke inducing disgusting. ( think gas station bathroom that mostly only homeless people use disgusting) so i empty a bottle of bleach onto the floor and start swishing it around with a mop when my mother walks by and says something like its my responsibility to clean everything anyway,  how could i let it get that dirty blah blah blah and walks off down the hallway. 

i walk off after her and she sits at the head of dining room table and im flipping out about how come im the only one out of the 6 people who live here who does any chores at all, plus i pay rent blah blah blah 

when i looked left tword the livingroom i stopped speaking mid sentence. there she is. standing there as if shed never died. right at the end of the table. you cannot describe the feeling of joy i experienced seeing her stand there . the world was right again for one brief second.  ::  followed directly by intense sadness when  ""my cousin"" isnt my cousin, shes the lady id emailed. shed come straight from tx to talk about it. shes not my cousin. just a dead ringer.

Awhile back ago, I posted the live-action teaser for my game, [***She Dreams Elsewhere***.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=typmJV7y5rE) Today, I'm excited to finally share with you guys a playable demo!

The game itself is a surreal adventure JRPG about dreams and the extent to which they mirror reality. You are Thalia Sullivan, a high strung, anxiety-ridden, comatose woman on a journey to defeat the nightmares preventing her awakening, while also finding out how exactly this mess happened in the first place. Unfortunately for her, some nightmares are harder to confront than others… It's a deeply personal, mature story with themes of mental illness and self-identity mixed with psychedelic visuals, an original dreamlike soundtrack and challenging, turn-based battles; it’s like Earthbound/Persona met Adult Swim.

You can download the demo [**via itch.io**](https://lorenze.itch.io/she-dreams-elsewhere) or [**Game Jolt**](https://gamejolt.com/games/shedreams/383126), with a [**Steam**](https://store.steampowered.com/app/492540/She_Dreams_Elsewhere/) version of the demo coming later this week. I hope you guys give it a try, and if you do, lemme know what you think! Feel free to stream or make YouTube videos of it as well, it's yours to do with as you wish. :)

You can also follow the game's progression on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/StudioZevere), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/studiozevere/), [email updates](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScKLxRzWI1ezUOyC710Sjunqz4Y1Uvdilh0752Pd0TWaQnt8g/viewform?usp=sf_link) or the [development blog](https://studiozevere.com/).

#1 Dream Shadow Runners

I call these guys Shadow Runners, because they don't have any recognizable detail on their bodies, and they run really fast (I would say 80 km/h, lol). The Dream shadow runners doesn't appear suddenly in a dream, first, the zone of the dream must be empty of any other entities, if Shadow Runners are going to appear, all existing entities will run and hide in order to disappear.

They make no sound, and they will catch you pretty fast, if you think fast, you can start flying and escape from them, they can't jump or leave the ground, is the only counter I've have found. If they make contact with you, you are pretty dead in the dream, and wake up with your heart beating hard.

#2 The Silencers

I've never seen one of them, but when they are in your zone, you are unable to speak, yet, they can hear you like you could. In dispair, you will yell, trying to recover your voice or to ask for help, then you catch the attention of this entity, it will start walking towards your location, fast, and with heavy steps, shacking the ground, that will wake you up with fear.

#3 The pursuer (Also know as Satan, he told me that)

Do not confuse with the Shadow Runners, The Pursuer is a single entity that only appears when I dream about the stairs to the second floor of my house, sometimes it works together with the entites called ""Knows"".

When i'm using the stairs, in the middle of them, I hear the main door of my house breaking apart, and something running towards me, going up the stairs and ""kill me"", one of those times I could ask the entity why was doing this, it told me ""Because I Satan desires it this way"".

#4 Knows, or Familiars

The knows, are entities that takes shapes from know people, in most of the cases, they will shape as family, in my experience, these entites tried to lure me, calling me with my mother voice for example, to go somewhere. As i said, the Pursuer works with these, to lure me to go upstairs... There are 2 kinds of entity, one that uses the body to deceive, or just the voice and completly invisible.

#5 Daniels

Daniels is an unknow, invisible entity to me, it manifest when I read his name anywhere in a dream world, it always sends me into paralisis status, where a invisible entity, probably Daniels, tries to scare or attack me while the paralisis last, I can make me wake up, for some reason, my right arm is completly inmune to dream paralisis, i just slap my face until I really wake up.

I'm on a quest to disprove as many of these as possible.

I've already got many down, but there's probably new ones I haven't heard of. Feel free to share more, and post your experiences too!

**Reading**

Supposedly, you can't read in dreams, because when you look away and look back, the text will always change. Or it will just be an incoherent mess of scrambled letters.

This hasn't been true in my case. I can read in my dreams without any issues. In the last few days I had a dream where a microwave meal I bought came with a large book of instructions, and not only was reading it like normal, the text made sense. \(Well, until the creator of the meal decided to write a several\-page biography about themselves.\)

**Light Switches**

It is said that you can't use light switches, but they work fine for me. Not something that come up in my dreams that often, but no issues so far.

**Electronics**

Like light switches, supposedly it's difficult/impossible to use them, or they don't work as intended.

Usually work okay, though when I was younger I used to have nightmares about my electronics turning themselves on or acting weirdly in some way. But as an adult, they seem to function as normal.

**Telling the Time**

Again, it's supposedly impossible to tell the time in a dream.

This is not true for me. I've seen, and accurately remembered, the time on a clock multiple times.

I've also memorized number sequences that I've seen in dreams.

**Mirrors**

The myth is that if you look into a mirror in a dream, your face will always be distorted and nightmarish.

This isn't true for me. Mirrors are seemingly normal.

The only time my face has changed was if 1. I didn't look like my real world self to begin with \(common, I'm always changing appearance and sometimes even species\) or 2. I am lucid dreaming and I'm deliberately trying to change it.

No nightmarish face warping stuff has ever happened to me.

**Dying**

There have been a lot of posts about it on this sub, so I probably don't need to say it.

You CAN die in a dream without waking up. How this feels varies between different dreams and different people.

**Faces**

There's a claim that often floats around saying that every face you see in your dreams is someone that you've already met, as the brain cannot create new faces. This is not something I can say that I've definitively proven to be false, as I don't know my subconscious, but I'm pretty sure this isn't true. I think I would've remembered some of my ""dream\-only"" people, 

**New Experiences**

In addition to the above, some people say that you cannot experience something in a dream that you've never experienced in real life. This is obviously bogus.

**Running/Fighting**

I've done both in a dream, no issues.

**Dream Symbolism/Language**

Okay, this one is going to get me downvoted.

This is just my opinion, but dream symbolism and dream language are total horse crap.

For starters, it seems 50&#37; of all dream symbols are like ""ooh you dreamt of this, it means a large sum of money is coming your way!""

Given how complex my dreams are, if this was even slightly true, I think I'd be rich.

But alas, I'm not. Nothing has changed, and there are countless themes in my dreams every night.

**Conclusion**

I think the above myths CAN be true for many people... but probably because they believe it to be true.

In my experience, if I believe that my dreams will go one way, they are more likely to happen that way.

For example, if I have 2 similar nightmares in a row, and I think about whether it's going to happen again, it probably will. If one theme comes up in my dreams a few times, and I keep thinking about it, it's probably going to happen more.

Or the fact that when I first had sleep paralysis, it wasn't scary, and it wasn't until I read that it's usually terrifying for most people that I started dreaming I had SP and scary hallucinations.

So, the same is probably true for many people. If you read some article saying you can't do X and Y in a dream, you probably won't be able to, because you assumed it to be true.",top,"What are some dream ""rules"" or myths you know about?",44.0

At first i was in a very creepy toy shop that was owned by some old lady. Her right hand was a young woman who was dressed as a clown and together they turned the people who visited them into objects/toys. First they burnt them to a crisp, then they made a very fine powder with them and used a mold to turn the powder into objects that were randomly selected IIRC.

But the people were conscious during the entire process. After they were turned into the powder, they lost all their senses cause they didn't have the organs associated with them anymore, but they were still conscious and lived forever as random objects (like tables, stools, bathtubs, etc) that the lady and the clown girl hoarded at the back of their weird ass shop.

At some point the girl pulls out a lamp and start burning me. I decide I have to do something if I don't want to be a sentient piece of furniture forever and I tell her ""you know, i never had a girlfriend and it really sucks to know that i'll die without knowing what love means"" or some bullshit.

Fast forward a few days, she's given me her professional kik and we're chatting, but she's kinda cold. She wants to get to know me, but at the same time she doesn't want to drop her evil persona and let me get to know the real her. I tell myself i'll leave her all the time she wants, but that girl is pretty interesting and i want to give it a go. Then it skipped to another dream.

And that dream was also cool cause i IMMEDIATELY went lucid. I was in my local supermarket and i guess i sensed how different the atmosphere was from real life, even though it was a pretty faithful rendition. I looked at my hands and immediately knew it was a dream. So i decided to try and make a fireball.

Now, i can NEVER make fireballs. So I was like, aww, that sucks, guess it's another fail for me then - BUT WAIT, WHAT IF...?
So i went around asking everyone if they had a lighter until someone gave me one. I found a way to keep the lighter on and stuck it somewhere to keep it up and put my hands around the flame. And after some burns and other minor inconveniences, there it was, a wonderful, glorious, transluscent fireball! It burned like a bitch tho, so I promptly threw it on a display, and people started screaming and running around. But I didn't care. I had my fireball. I was the queen of the universe. I felt like the baddest motherfucker alive.

I somewhow ended up in the courtyard of my old primary school, where people were queueing to see a beautician that had opened their store there for some reason. The queue was soooo long, so I decided, fuck it, I'm not going in there. But then a guy came and started selling pizza. I took a salmon and avocado pizza (at first he heard salmon and pineapple, so I had to RUN AFTER HIM to make sure he wouldn't make this abomination). I remember I felt a little bit guilty for eating a pizza all by myself (I'm supposed to be watching my diet) and also for spending money (I'm supposed to be watching my wallet). But I did it anyway, cause I'm a strong independant woman. And that's the underwhelming end to an amazing dream.",top,"LPT: In a dream, when you're about to get killed, try to flirt with the villain.

0.0,7zi15u,49.0,45.0,"For the last 31 years, I have pursued the Art of Lucid Dreaming since the age of fifteen after reading an article in an Omni Magazine published in March, 1987 where Dr. Stephen LaBerge talked about this ability to be conscious during a dream. It was called Lucid Dreaming. As a young teenager, the idea that I could be in control of my dreams was a thrilling idea. My non-lucid dreams were already loads of fun, and I could only imagine how incredible it could be to actually be awake and in control.

Shorty after reading the article, I had my first lucid dream. It was everything the article promised and more. The first of thousands of lucid dreams to follow and now after 31 years I thought it would be a good time to reflect on what I have accomplished and learned through living a second life in the world of dreams.

Why is Lucid Dreaming something one would like to do? Why do we read a book, watch a movie or play a video game? We like to be entertained. At the most fundamental level Lucid Dreaming is a thrilling form of entertainment. Even non-lucid dreams can be wonderfully entertaining. Look at any dream you can remember that left you in awe at what you experienced in that focus state. Now imagine being in control where you can dream anything you desire in that same realistic format. It's not hard to see that Lucid Dreaming can be both an adventure and an experience.

When I talk about what dreaming is. I first describe it as having your own virtual reality simulator that is more evolved and sensory driven than say our current VR technology like Oculus Rift. Unlike digital virtual reality which offers a visual 3D view, Lucid Dreaming (and dreaming in general) allows you to have a 100% fully immersed sensory driven virtual reality experience. Having practiced this skill along with other techniques to enhance perception in dreams, my dreams for the time that I am there are as detailed and complex as the waking world. I exist in a simulated 3D environment, I can see vivid colors, hear sounds, feel objects and textures, taste and smell food. I even have a sense of heat/cold as well as pain. Through a technique I call cognitive mapping which invokes perception exercises in the waking world for the purpose of enhancing the same skill of perception in the dream world, the end result are dreams that appear as real or more real than how I experience my waking life. This truly is a virtual reality simulator that nature has evolved, and all it takes is consciousness to play.

What this has given me is best of two worlds. I get to be conscious and self-aware in my waking life, and take this quality of self-awareness into a dream reality which extends who I am and add new conscious experiences that I otherwise would never have. Think about this as one of my driving motivators. We all know we are going to live for a relatively short period of time. There is no escaping the inevitability of death so knowing we have a limited amount of time to experience ourself existing, what do we have that adds conscious experience to this limited amount of time? See where I am going? We can add hours of consciousness during sleep in another format of experiential reality adding time to our over all conscious experience pool.

In 31 years of lucid dreaming, I have incubated and cultivated roughly 10 years of consciousness during sleep. Why I estimate roughly 10 years is due to the perception of time during lucidity which can greatly exceed that time when I sleep. And in many cases I have logged these extra hours, even days in my journals. Funny enough I have encountered people who just cannot fathom that this potential exists and call me out claiming I'm lying because almost zero research has been done short of one experiment in 1985 which during the run didn't provide evidence of time perception being expanded during lucid dreaming.

It is a known fact that the perception of time can stretch under the influence of drugs, hypnosis and surprise surprise... dreams. Neuroscientist Warren Meck tested drug induced time perception on rats and noted that they did have a speed up or slow down of their internal clock based on drug influences. There is also other research such as the Kappa Effect which is another form of temporal illusion where our perception of time in waking life can feel longer than actual physical time.

There is even a desire to create a time dilating drug for prisoners that trap them in this sense of altered time for 1,000 years in 8 hours. http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10697529/Prisoners-could-serve-1000-year-sentence-in-eight-hours.html. Psychoactive drugs like LSD, Mescaline and DMT also have people reporting extraordinary perception of time.

My first encounter with the perception of time stretching in my own lucid dreams was back in 1992, 5 years after I started lucid dreaming. It was 8:00am in the morning and I had some time to sleep before I had to go to work. I became dream locked in this dream where the perception of time lasted 2 weeks. Trapped in this pocket of dream time living a second life as an artist going to college and then working at a cafe. I would even wake up and fall asleep in the dream until finally waking up. I was lucid for the whole time knowing I was dreaming but couldn't wake up from it. When it approached what felt like 2 weeks I started to have the fear and panic that something was wrong, that maybe I am sleeping in or worse something bad happened to my body so I forced myself awake to then look at the clock seeing the time as 8:30am. Only 30 minutes of sleep yet I had an insurmountable amount of time that I could never fit in 30 minutes. Even just one of the art classes took over an hour and I had many of those in just one of the days, let alone the job at the cafe, or hanging out with friends going to pubs and night clubs. All this experience which felt like 2 weeks yet only 30 minutes of sleep. I was hooked on this potential. I saw the possibilities of what it could add to my life and have never looked back.

In many cases it can be just a few extra hours, others a few days but in the rarest the longest I have experienced is 2 weeks. I call them Mini Vacations. That said I have talked with people through the years over the Internet who claim to have lived entire lifetimes in one cycle of sleep. I have not, and have no reason to lie or embellish that I have. My max is 2 weeks and that has only happened a couple of times. The average seems to be extra hours, sometimes up to 8. It's more common, the ones that last days are also rare but recently I did have one that lasted about 3 days. I just never know what to expect the inevitable wake-up always happens.

I know another conscious practitioner who I respect, and we discussed this ability to perceive more time during sleep than when the body sleeps and their longest experience was 3 months. I haven't broken the 2 week barrier yet in my own sleep. Quite often this is due to fear as have a hard time allowing it to just continue as my fear is that I might be sleeping too long, or maybe something is wrong and I wake myself up foolishly to check on my body only to find 20 or 30 minutes have past.

I doubt many people know what it's like to be locked in a dream that goes on and on, like a lengthy false awakening. I personally love it, but I admit defeat at chickening out when it gets too lengthy. This is something you really have to go through multiple times to appreciate it's potential also why certain understandable fears may arise that can cause you to eject yourself from that dream. Hopefully, I can become more allowing and proficient as I still manage to have very long lucid dreams in short naps.

Why do I believe the 1985 sleep study failed? The lucid dreamers had to use their physical body to move their eyes to count time in the dream. In my view, this is already syncing your perception of time with physical time as you are using a physical mechanic, the eyes to measure time. In my deep lucid dreams, there is 100% immersion and I have no sense of my body lying in it's bed. The immersion is so deep, that the dream reality for that time is all I know. I believe this deep level of immersion allows the perception of time to stretch as there is no physical constraints applied to the dream in such a case. But how does one measure it? I can imagine perhaps differences in EEG and fMRI scans may review additional activity, perhaps an increased activity.

At this point in my life, I don't worry about what other people believe rather I'll figure it out for myself through knowledge gained from actual valid lucid dream experience where I answer my own questions. If I listened to the naysayers when I was 15 that lucid dreaming was impossible and woo, I'd have lost 31 years of amazing adventures. Somethings you just have to do it for real rather than read about it in some book. Lucid dreaming is one of those things you have to experience to know.

Unlike belief which this world is ripe with, lucid dreaming is a genuine experience that one can obtain through focus, practice and discipline. The rewards and potential in my view are endless. It's a gift that keeps on giving unlike a belief which offers zero experience and no return on investment. A belief isn't going to make you lucid dream, a belief won't extend your perception of time. Actually doing it will. That's the difference. Once you know you can be conscious in a dream, it's no longer a belief it's fact. You now have knowledge through experience. Why, because this is something you achieved. No one else can dream your dream, let alone make you conscious in them.

My dream routine of late has been doubling up on lucid dreams per day as I have been using two time periods to incubate lucidity. In the morning I wake up at 4:00am, stay up until 5:00am using WBTB [Wake-Back-To-Bed] and WILD [Waking Induced Lucid Dream] for 15-30 minutes if I fail, I fall back on MILD [Mneumonic Induced Lucid Dream]. If I stick to this method as part of my daily routine I have a lucid dream nearly every night.

If time permits, I try to have a nap at 5:00pm to about 6:30pm for an evening lucid dream using the same technique as listed above. In many cases I can double up on lucid dreaming for the day and for me this is far superior a form of entertainment than anything I have encountered in the waking world. TV, Movies, Video Games, Books are all ok, but I can do better with my dreams having the benefit of total control and ability to create anything I desire in nearly any formatted genre as one of my driving inspirations to dream is using a technique I call Genre Specific Lucid Dreams [GSLD] which I have been perfecting over the last 30 years. Sure, it's entirely about entertainment and that is exactly what brought me into lucid dreaming at the age of 15.

I've been trying to write down the more exciting ones. It makes my dream journal read like an epic Heavy Metal / Sci-Fi / Fantasy movie as not only do I dream in normal waking reality but can create cartoon, video game, movie genres by manipulating the dream through visualization and intent. The dreams I tend to skip over are the more mundane, boring or down right weird.

This is also why many of my dream journal entries can be quite lengthy. And quite often, I am only covering what I liked about the dream omitting plenty of uninteresting mundane content as writing all of it down is vastly time consuming. I get to skip the long moments of say walking down a street, or driving in a car. No way to create that sense of time in the reader and why bore them with the lack of interesting details.

It's nice to have a dream blog as I hope people who encounter one of the more adventurous dreams see that potential and desire to be able to also achieve that type of dream. When you approach lucid dreaming as an art form where you are the writer, director, content creator and star, it becomes a supreme form of experience and entertainment.

Lucid dreaming has been scientifically proven that we do lucid dream. Today, I find skeptics and atheists who enjoy lucid dreaming. They are able to do it, and enjoy the experience that it brings. There are still skeptics I encounter who don't believe it which is fine, they haven't had the experience. I'm not here to convince them but all I can do is offer techniques and my own interpretation of the experience as a motivator for others seeking to do the same or greater with their own dreams.

Even today, our entire culture is so dream illiterate I find very few people who routinely explore and experience lucid dreaming short of through the Internet. I find it sad, because people seem to believe in all sorts of unverifiable ideas yet don't want to believe in the one thing that provides genuine experience and adds valuable self-awareness and conscious experience to one's limited lifespan. I always try to get that point across. I add hours of conscious experience to my life by engaging a vividly realistic and fantastically detailed dream reality every night. Even my non-lucid dreams are vividly realistic and also add a value of experience as long as I remember them. I dream every night, it is very rare not to remember any type of dream upon waking.

And the jest of it, most people who I try to open up about with this ability make the stupid mistake of judging me either weird or crazy. I'm weird or crazy because I can remain conscious into sleep, a skill I worked on since 1987 over the last 31 years so I could learn to simulate and create a vivid reality as real as the one I wake up to for hours on end in a format that is better than anything I find in waking life. The food is better, the sex is better, the activity is better, the worlds are endless and it never stops producing amazing experiences that even drugs fail to offer. My attitude in response? Enjoy loosing 8 hour of their life every day until they die where those who engage and participate in their dreams stand to gain 2, 4, 8, days, weeks potentially unknown hours of pure conscious experience every-time they sleep.

In my life, I have had to endure the judgments of others who don't get it or understand. I've been called everything from crazy to weird. The reality is, I can create anything I desire when I sleep. What a terrible and weird thing to be able to do. Who wants to have the power and control to create absolutely any fantasy or desire in a vivid format that is equal to or better than waking reality? Yet they all love movies, books and video games missing out on the one virtual reality simulator nature evolved and they've had since birth. I didn't make that mistake. I engaged it passionately.

I don't blame them, our modern society has given dreaming a bad rap with such lame claims that dreams are nothing but random noise so every psychologist or researcher cites that as some fact rather than listening to the the ones who actually have some intelligence behind the art of dreaming as a skill. We have the scientific evidence that lucid dreaming exists, it is real. We don't have to pretend that it doesn't and ridicule those who engage this art form.

Look at how neglected and shoved to the wayside Lucid Dreaming really is. It took until the late 1970's to obtain evidence that it was possible to satisfy the skeptics. Prior we had the skeptics claiming this is woo, which really means it will be ignored by the academic circles. Fast forward and through fMRI we have undeniable evidence that people can be conscious during sleep. Wow scientists... took you that long to figure out what people have been doing since before the bronze age. Where has this benefited humanity with knowledge of how to obtain this focus state? Not in the media, not in the schools, still throwing that baby out with the bathwater in 2018.

Sure they teach you how to draw, play a musical instrument, add numbers, do sports in school but I've yet to see main stream academia establish a lucid dreaming class that progresses people from child hood up to a master PhD in University in the science and skill of lucid dreaming. Thus no one benefits, most live half their life throwing away the better half. What is it going to take to wake people up to this wonderful skill and ability?

Now we have the Internet and there are pockets of forums and newsgroups that offer information on lucid dreaming. Many websites and authors cropping up but like anything there is good information and bad information mixed in with this simply ability to maintain consciousness during sleep. I think my progressive guide on lucid dreaming embodies the most straight forward tested approach to this experience. Largely in part to the influence of Dr. Stephen LaBerge who I credit for sparking my initiation to this idea back in 1985. He's been a wonderful influence in my journey.

Thus the choice resides in the individual, it is up to those who want to pursue this ability to make that lifestyle choice and reap the rewards while others lie unconscious in their sleep wasting away potential experience. I guess you don't know what you miss if you don't value it.

For me, I enjoy the quality of the experience and the entertainment value. I'll share some links to some of my more genre specific lucid dreams as I love to recreate fantasy worlds in this vividly real dream format.

This day was particularly bad, and I was laying in bed for hours reflecting on many negative experiences throughout my life, as I have done many, many times before.

I remembered one particular moment in middle school (I'm 30 now) where I was with a friend of mine who always got into trouble. We had been clashing with these kids in the neighborhood, and ran into them. After some serious negative words back & forth a fight broke out and my friend beat on one of the kids badly. I've always felt guilt and regret about that day.

I'm not sure how or why I decided to do this, but I looked at it objectively, as an adult, and I forgave each of the kids involved. I forgave myself, my friend, and the boys we were having it out with. 

I'm not a religious person, but in that moment I made a pact, to the universe, or God, or whatever was out there, that I would practice nonviolence and de-escalate any conflict from this point forward. I would also make a point to practice forgiveness.

My depression faded. I smiled and drifted off to sleep.

Then, as I dreamed, I felt what I can only describe as an all-loving, all-knowing presence. Something that knew everything about me and I recognized it. I felt like a baby in the presence of a loving parent. I felt my entire body fill with love and warmth and peace. It was so profound that I could feel my entire body fill with an energy and a bliss that I've never even come close to feeling before. 

It was powerful enough to wake me up, and I was the happiest I've ever felt. Haven't had a negative thought since then. I hope I stay this way.

I just wanted to share this experience and see if anyone else has had a similar experience or could point me in the direction of more info on this sort of thing.

The hug was like I could feel her like when I was a little kid, and she didn't look old or sick she was young and beautiful, I have never seen her at this age and never seen pictures where she looked like this, and also there was just this really big sense of love. 

I really believe she reached out to me because I have hade lucid dreams and stuff but never have I experienced anything like this, and never tried communication with a dream character that was like this, normally it's really confusing and not fitting together. 

When I woke up me bed was soaking wet from sweat, I wasn't scared, it was just really amazing and emotional, I cried when I woke up.

I've had a wedding dream at least 3 times in the last year with him in it and it always goes wrong or feels twisted and unnatural. E was a close friend and we even dated a bit, but we had a serious falling out. 
I should mention my dreams are exceptionally vivid, and I write the down as soon as I wake up - I've been doing this the last 5 years in an attempt to try and lucid dream - but that's another post, I think.
The first dream I'm on the wrong side walking down the aisle and instead of everyone standing to look at me, they all turn their heads away from me as I pass. There's no music. The colors are a dull grey and a sick, rotten purple. My dress is beautiful, but I feel it's going to suffocate me.  My dad is walking beside me saying, ""This was your choice."" I tell him I don't want to marry E, that this whole thing was a mistake, but he pushes me into E's waiting arms. E's arms are holding too tight onto my hands, it hurts. His face has no emotion, just a dead, blank stare - again, I'm standing on the wrong side. In all the weddings I've been to, the woman always stands on the audiences left and I'm on the right. I try to remove my hands but E holds on tighter. I want to cry out but I can't make any noise.

The second dream I'm marrying a different man, C. It's not a big wedding, and we're both dressed pretty casually but I don't mind at all. He's wearing a sharp blue suit jacket with brown pants. I'm wearing a peach sundress. Everyone is smiling and enjoying themselves. We couldn't afford rings, so we made our own out of spoons. I  admired mine like it was a priceless thing. 

The third dream is the most recent. 
I'm in a wedding dress that's got a fish aquarium in the gown part, but I can walk easily. Almost trip but I laugh it off. Marrying some blond guy who's tall. Or maybe he has dark hair? Talking to guests after wedding saying they're surprised I didn't marry E. I feel sick to my stomach. Someone says he is coming to confront me. I have some pineapple juice. 
I see him. I climb up a bunk bed. He hands me an index card of people giving their opinions of my marriage to E. A lot of them say he's dangerous. Someone tells me to start watching Twilight for romantic advice. E thinks he's winning me over, but I'm crying because he's wrong. I second guess myself as he comes up the bed. He kisses me, and I kiss him back. I hold his face in my hands and say, ""This is good-bye. I love you, but I can't.""

The man I'm married to sees us, but he looks at me with understanding in his eyes. I stare down at my wedding ring. It's beautiful. I wish time would go back to when I first met my husband, so I can show E why it's not going to happen.

E gets upset and leaves. I'm left weeping on the bed.

My wish to travel back in time still works. I'm holding a white kitten, about to dump some eggs and take the kitten outside. I do both. A black car pulls into our driveway, and I grab the kitten from where it was sniffing a black kitten and go towards the car.

0.0,9xmlu8,6.0,44.0,"I had a dream last night that I managed to remember many details of because my wife woke me up, mid-dream, in response to me shaking and making high-pitched noises. So here goes.

(I've been watching horror movies almost every day since mid October, so maybe that played a role here.)

The dream - I was working in a lab with this kind of mad scientist (but actually just crazy) guy who had the idea that he could send people to space. It seemed like he half believed it, and half just used it as an excuse to draw people in. He would offer people the opportunity to go to space but had some crazy protocol, like he would need to do weird stuff to them, random surgical procedures, before they could ""go to space."" There was no space ship or space gear anywhere to be seen. I was helping the guy as some kind of lab assistant because for some reason it was just my job, even though I felt a little uneasy about it. But it was just a job.

So this pregnant lady comes in, she's seen the ad or whatever, wants to go to space. I expect the guy to say no because she's pregnant, but instead he says yes, but we'll have to drain all the blood out of your body in order for it to be possible. The lady hesitantly agrees, and I ask the scientist guy how can we send this lady to space, she's like seven months pregnant. He kind of brushes it off like eh, let's just do it. So we drain all the blood out of her body through a tube that drips into some drain on the floor. Don't remember what happened next but I assume she didn't make it.

Anyway, then it was evening and we were just chilling in the lab. The window was open all of the sudden, and the guy was asking how did this happen, it was closed... I went to inspect the window, and it was a window from a place I had lived in real life where due to vibrations over time in the house the lock would move and eventually open. I explained this to him and just closed the window and locked it again. 

However, the window opened again, suddenly, and the mad scientist said, ""I don't think that's just from vibrations in the house."" He went over and looked and said in a shocked voice, ""There are people out here, who are these people??!"" I went over to see as he retreated, and one of the people disappeared into thin air - it became clear that they were ghosts. I thought maybe they were the ghosts of the victims of the mad scientist's ""space preparation"" procedures. When the one ghost vanished, another one appeared and it was just a little girl. I got freaked out and started screaming, ""*Who is that the ghost of, who is that the ghost of*,"" thinking that maybe it was the unborn child of the lady we just drained all the blood out of. 

At this point, I was making high-pitched noises of some kind in real life and my wife was gently trying to wake me up, which I became vaguely aware of. At the last moment, a big, half-eaten sandwich appears in the little girl's hand. It's way too big for a tiny girl to hold with one hand in real life. I recognize it as a unique type of sandwich that they make in a restaurant in my city - we get take-out from there about once a month. Incredulous, I manage to sputter out the question, ""Wait, is that the ghost...of a sandwich?""

At this point I wake up and my wife is worried, asking if I'm ok, etc. Surprisingly I am fine and actually start kind of laughing and tell her just go back to sleep forget about it. The ""sandwich ghost"" was a sandwich that I bought a month or two ago and had to throw away. It was a day when I was really hungry and I insisted on getting two sandwiches just for me, even though my wife protested and said it's too much, they are huge sandwiches, you will either not finish or get sick. Well, I didn't finish the second sandwich and it got thrown away. She gave me a hard time about it for wasting the food, the money, I told you so, etc. I guess it was still weighing on my conscience, and my brain had to put me through that whole fucked up scenario just to address the real issue at hand.

The dream was centerd around me reuniting with my old high-schools friends. It was so great and felt so real. I invited everyone to this large complex that was inside like a mini resort so we all met up, reconnected, laughed, hugged, drank, watched movies. It was so great. There were even kids I wasn't normally friends with there and it felt like I was right back in 2011 (year I graduated) 


Now before this part during the dream, I had to travel to get to this place. In the dream I remember being at a hotel staring out the window and taking in the view. It was a spectacular view of a harbor with lots of yachts and beautiful shops. This is important for later...


So like I said, the dream was about old high-schools friends. I felt like I actually spent quality time with friends I haven't seen in years, girls I used to have crushes on who I was able to talk normally to now. It was so good to see and talk to these people again. Hugging these people felt so real and I'm so tempted to call these people up and tell them how much I miss them.


When the party was winding down, and everyone was either passed out or asleep, me and my friend who I would consider my best friend, were eating and talking over late night drinks about life, work. He's a super smart guy, goofy, but we all joked he was the dumbest smart guy we all knew. We loved him for this.  


As we were talking somehow the topic of facebook came up. See, earlier in the dream, we had ran into Zuckerberg (or at least saw him) and I remember shouting 'fuck Facebook!' loud enough for him to hear (he didn't acknowledge me) to make my friends laugh. In the dream we were drunk so it seemed appropriate.  We were walking in group and saw him a couple blocks down with his entourage and security, so I just had to yell something.


Anyway fast forward back to me and my best friend having our sit-down. We're talking and I remember him joking about how Facebook was the only way we could keep in touch and that I shouldn't have said that. We laughed. He was right, group chats kept us somewhat close years after graduation. I knew he was right but I didn't care and I know he didn't either. We were just having fun and enjoying each other's company.


So here comes the fucked up part. We're talking (at a cafe type deal) and we notice Zuckerberg walking down the street near us. Oddly, alone. As a joke, my friend shouts to him 'I love you Zuck!!!! Thanks for fb' something along the lines of that. He looks at me and smiles because of what I said earlier. Zuckerberg, without even looking at us or breaking stride, condescendingly says 'Yeah?' and walks away. Were laughing again. We were basically just being punks.


I remember thinking to myself how this whole trip was so fun and light hearted until 3 minutes later Zuckerberg walks back towards us. He drops a laptop on our table and walks away. Thinking he just gave it as a personal gift, we freak out in excitement. It looked like *his* laptop, older and had some stickers on the outside.


I tell friend we have to open it up. Two others have now joined us and so we open it up. Immediately a video starts playing. I honestly can't remember the details of the video except for the part that freaked me out the most, but it was very unsettling. Like we shouldn't have had access to watch the video in the first place. It was like one of those Zeitgeist videos that show all the horrors of humanity with quick cuts and confusing scenes, except it had more to do with technology and surveillance.


During the middle of the video, there's a scene where a drone flys straight up and gets a birds eye view of this goregous marina with boats and hotels everywhere. It looks around.. Then the camera zooms in on a hotel. Then it zooms in on a window, where a blurry outline of a man is standing. What the hell? Then it zooms in even further and with stunning clarity shows my face, staring out that hotel window with my Reddit username beneath me. !!!!!! Panic sets in that I can still feel and makes my hair stand up.


I remember trying not to freak the fuck out and my friends were all like WTF too. It was an extremely ominous feeling. We didn't know how that was even possible and it scared us all shitless. How did he know I was even staying at that hotel. How did the drone even have those types of capabilities!? Was this a personal fuck you just because I said fuck Facebook!?


I don't remember much of what happened after (we said our goodbyes and parted ways) but even though it was just a dream, it felt so real! It really felt like I pissed off the Zuck so he decided to fuck with and show me just how small I was.


Now the effects have worn off and I realize it was just a silly dream, but inside that dream I had never felt so... Insignificant..? Ever in my life. I woke up wondering what the FUCK did I just get myself into and questioned if parts of it were real.


So yeah. Sorry for the lengthy write up, but it was definitely a trip!

I have no idea how much time passed by in real life as I dreamt this, but for the 3 seconds after the explosion I knew I was going to die. I could feel it. I knew it was happening and that there was nothing I could do to stop it. I knew that everything would be dark in a matter of seconds, and my existence would be over.  

I woke up sobbing, and it unsettled me for the rest of the day.  

The second time was last night. I felt what it is like to be loved by someone with admiration and without condition. I've never felt anything like it. It felt so real, and I felt so happy. Like I didn't care about anything else in the world as long as I was looking into this person's eyes.  

Upon waking up, there's a split second in which I thought that that was my life. That I was waking up to that this morning. And then it hits you, suddenly. I wept - not just because I was missing something I felt like I once had, but in despair that I could never return to that world - to that person. I didn't even care about dream vs. reality. I just wanted to return to a place where I could experience that feeling again.   

Funny thing is, I've never cared about being alone. I've enjoyed it, actually. But now, I just feel...a great absence.

I remember thinking that I'm glad my physical body is in a safe place now because that means I can concentrate on the trip. I wasn't stressed at all. I remember having vivid visuals and feeling as if I'm one with the universe. I remember my soul/consciousness  floating around in outer space, without purpose, just exploring what it looks like.

Later in the dream, I was in a doctor's office looking at my X-rays. I could see the tumor at the back of my head and the doctor had said it was a result of cat feces (another weird part) and that sometimes stuff like this happened. 

I woke up and my day was ruined, as was the whole next day. I was so anxious and panicked that I might have had a brain tumor despite no symptoms and the dream was a premonition. I got over it, but it definitely took like two or three days.

Today, about a week later from the initial dream, my friend I haven't talked to in a month texted me saying she had a dream about me.

She said in her dream, she saw me at a restaurant and I didn't recognize her. She asked what was up with me and I answered that I had had a bunch of neck surgeries and as a result had lost some memories, including those from high school.

Now I'm scared all over again. I struggle with anxiety and depression and I don't know if this is symbolic of my mental problems or if the universe is actually trying to tell me I have a brain tumor. 

I'm 20 and I don't feel like I have a brain tumor (no nausea, no dizziness, no pain) but I'm still worried. I don't have health insurance right now and can't afford an MRI so I have no idea of what to make of this.

This purple giant floating cube descended out of the sky and during night would hover in the city before rising again during the day. My mom told me about the ""cube conscriptions"" and that the last time the cube appeared they made her join the Russian army and that seemed completely logical to me. I was wondering how good the cube wages might be. The next day on the way to school I was grabbed and I materialised inside the cube with my hands tied behind my back in a big gymnasium filled with both really happy dancers doing complicated routines and people that were dancing while crying and screaming. Putin told me I had to dance to earn my right to live and that I would be paid handsomely and I was untied.

So I started dancing and doing exercises where we ran through halls of fire for some reason and I started to get good at it and I became Putin's favourite and I was able to lessen his wrath towards other members of the group by distracting him, there were a lot who were young children who had also been kidnapped. I was moved to the top level of the cube and forced to share Putin's bedroom. he called me out of a performance one day and raped me and I could feel my body spiralling around in space as it happened as if I dissociated. He was definitely Putin but he had a high pitch voice and was fat, like he was full of helium.

Putin started selling the tickets to the show and he landed the cube and had us dancers selling tickets by the entrance. I was able to slip a note asking for help to a stranger and then I helped them smuggle a child out of the cube so they could be returned to their family and escape the deadly performance and Putin's wrath. Then the cube began to set on fire, I don't remember how but I climbed through a fruit street stall and escaped with the others and the cube was raided by the police. 

Then I was at a weird hospital where everyone was speaking a different language and there were flashing screens everywhere showing pictures of different alien children and occasionally human children. This lady in a veil led me to a white room and weird chair and knocked me out and when I woke up she gave me ""my child"" which was a miniature version of myself and I started screaming and trying to kill it saying that it should never have been born. Then the miniature version of me staring crying and I felt bad and tried to comfort and apologise to it. The lady took the tiny me away and I never saw it again, she took me to an office room.

The office was dark and there was a computer desk covered in open books and cards at the end and there was a man smirking sitting in the spinny chair at the desk facing towards me when I entered in a cliched ""i've been expecting you"" way. He asked me if I'd had enough yet and then some weird thought provoking questions about existence which he mocked my answers to because I ""clearly new nothing of this world, or mine"" I realised I was floating around the room and I tucked my head into my knees and was floating around like that while this guy kept laughing and talking  until I finally woke up.

I take meds for anxiety and depression and thats all I was on that night, I don't know if I read something weird before bed but that dream was honestly bizarre.

For those of you who don't know, she is a famous singer who is currently working on her newest album - and a couple songs have been teased on her social media.

[In my dream, I heard the entire song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nee7m-SrNng)

""Emotional Machine"" is the title, and it was a beautiful song, from what I can remember vividly the lyrics were, 

""The day I was born my parents knew I would be, somebody who'd accomplish amazing things. I wish they'd've seen me for who I really was instead of the person I could be.

So I pushed real hard, I shoved, I grabbed, I reached for the person they held close, who they wanted me to be. Way up high in the clouds, on this pedestal of doubt when I realized that person is me.

Emotional Machine, I'M who they wanted me to be, me.""

I remember the sound of the Omnichord, the drums, pratically the whole first half of the song - but once it passes the chorus its all a hazy blur.

We started counting down from 60 to its take-off and when it began its ascent I realised how BIG it was. 

I turned to my friend and she said ""are you thinking what I'm thinking?""

I was thinking about how it was never going to take to the skies. I was thinking about how it was going to climb up and come hurtling back down. I was thinking about how were all going to die, and that there was nothing I could do. 

Then I looked back to the ascending rocket and, sure enough, it had begun to sputter and judder, and was starting to nose dive straight towards us. 

I looked at it, and I was at peace with the fact that I was going to cease existing soon. 

The rocket hit the ground, exploding outwards in a huge ring of fire. I braced myself against the heat, and I thought, ""*this is what it's like to die*"". 

My body evaporated, I felt an odd sensation, and suddenly I had no body or physical manifestation; I was just consciousness. I began to create life in my thoughts – and buildings, people, towns. Eventually I had created the universe as I knew it.

If so, then you sound like me -- someone on the Lucid Dreaming path.  After about 30 years of lucid dreaming, I wrote my first book - Lucid Dreaming Gateway to the Inner Self -- to share some of my discoveries of manipulating the lucid realm, influencing waking reality and encouraging others to explore lucid dreaming more deeply.  

Then in 2015, decided to write a book for beginners and intermediate lucid dreamers (with Londoner, Caroline McCready) called, Lucid Dreaming Plain and Simple.  

I always try to show real-world examples of lucid dreams from my own and other's dream journals, and use people's full names, so they can be contacted (for example, if you want to talk with them about their experience using lucid dreams to physically heal their body).  And I try to expand the scope of lucid dreaming (so Muggles do not stifle it), while pointing out how lucid dreaming's potential could be scientifically explored.

Lucid dreaming is a revolutionary psychological tool for personal and scientific discovery.  Please join this AMA -- and lucid wishes on your journey of awareness!

0.0,3v9il8,42.0,42.0,"I had the most realistic dream about 2 years ago, and I will never forget it. I had died and was selected by satan to be sent to earth intermittently with a team of other people to claim the souls of people he deemed worthy of being sent to hell (killing them so they can be claimed by him). I wasn't in hell but I couldn't move on either. I could still ""die"" when being sent to claim someone, so it was a constant fight for my life. After the team would claim someone those who were still alive would be judged. I would walk up a flight of stairs onto a platform that was surrounded by a plane of hellfire, and the stairs were bigger than what can be described. Each stair and the platform were bigger than a planet. I have no idea how I climbed each stair but as I got to the platform each time I would look around at the vast and endless hellfire plane. I would walk to the edge of the platform and at the bottom was a pool of blood. Satan would talk to me for a second, judging me by my skill on the mission and I would fall into the pool of blood. As I hit the pool I was instantly overcome with unimaginable pain. I had no body only a conscious drifting in a white nothingness and felt only pain. The amount of pain was always determined by how well I did, but at the minimum was excruciating. This process could last for what felt like days at a time. This process of being sent, claiming people, and judgement went on for over a hundred years. I remember talking to the people with me as we were sent away about how long they had been there. A lot of people that were with me died and were replaced. After about a hundred years I finally went to satan and told him I am done, I am not doing this anymore and I don't care what he does to me. He looked at me, smiled, and blood started to pour from his mouth. I faded into the white consciousness again and felt nothing but pain until I woke up, and even was in pain for about a minute afterwards.

The thing about this dream was the realism to it. I just turned 24 a few weeks ago, but ever since I woke up from this dream I really feel a hundred years older like I am actually 124. Physically and emotionally a hundred years older. I remember the exact number of people that I killed.

I was at a mall with a strong urge to relieve myself. I went into the men's restroom only to find that there were only three toilets there without stalls, and no urinals. All the toilets were dirty, but one in particular was basically overflowing with fecal matter. I still had to urinate, and was contemplating desperately which one I of the disgusting WC's I should go for. But then another guy stumbled in. 
He looked like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys, only bald and with round glasses. The man went straight past me and stuck his whole arm down the overflown toilet. He pulled up two big condoms filled to the rim with feces. Then he started chewing on both of them until they eventually ripped. Finally he stuck the empty condoms in his ear and started wagging his brown tounge at me. At which point I sprinted out the door. 

And then I woke up. I was disgusted at first, put minutes after I was laughing. It was if is my brain was trying to push my limits. I don't even enjoy toilet humor, and have never in my life dreamt anything quite like this.

I liked to just get out of the house and go for a drive, have a little chat every now and again, not actually doing anything. It helped with my anxiety and depression, an unfortunate thing I didn't know we had in common until long after he was gone.

He passed away of a massive heart attack. My brother and I were there when it happened, and he would come to me a lot in dreams after the fact.

One of the dreams was early on. Maybe a week after he passed.
He was at a little house, it had a strangely placed garage and the front yard was a little messy with wood bits and scraps and such, but that was pretty normal for him (not only did he have a thing for cars, he believed everything had a purpose and would keep the most absurd of things). There was a cream car down the driveway on the right side of the house facing.
In this dream he'd been working on something - it's been a while, I can't recall the dream completely - and I had come to visit. I was consciously aware of the dream. I knew it was a dream, but dad did not.
He greeted me like normal, offered me a drink. I politely declined and said I needed to talk to him. He was not aware he was dead, but he was not shocked to hear it when I told him. He brushed it off like it was something simple and nothing to worry about.
Dad asked me to come with him to Subway, a place we would always go, where we'd both get the same sub, to talk more about what was happening in the real world.
We jumped into the car, and went for a drive. I told him about what was going on, and he did very dad-like things that I knew him for like saying ""wHAT?"" in the way he did. More or less he wasn't impressed with what's happening.
After we arrived at the Subway the dream ended.

A point I made of the dream was the car. Being a grand car fanatic it was something very signature of my dad. But I'd never seen it before in my life, it didn't make sense. It was an old cream sedan with a sloping back window. I googled some images and only found some similar. I held onto the images though knowing this would probably be the closest I could get to knowing what that car was. Otherwise it didn't really make sense.

Today I'm at a family friend's house. I told her about this dream for the first time, I told her about a cream car, and she told me she knew it. 

She showed me pictures of a [cream sigma sedan](http://imgur.com/a/oPapG).

It was one of my dad's first cars. He crashed it a long time ago, smashed in the front end, and as a result totalled it...

Until this day I had never seen this car before in my life, but this was the exact car I saw in my dream. A piece of a puzzle fell into place. The car must have meant a lot to him if he showed it to me and brought it with him into the next realm of existence. I guess in a way the car was already there waiting for him, after he crashed it in this physical realm.

I cried for a little while, the family friend appologised for showing it to me, but it's honestly given me more peace than anything. Crying was just a side effect of a happy realisation ;u; It's just weird is all.",top,I had a dream about my dad a year ago. Today it made sense.,44.0

I woke up screaming, and my mom and dad catered me back to sleep. This dream continued each night for a month, same time each night.

I start to panic because I remember all those times she had told me that ""you only start to dream of the dead when you are close to dying yourself"". In the dream, I grab her hands and plead with her to tell me if I'm about to die. With a smile she tells me ""don't be silly. You're just lost and you keep on wandering around but you don't realise how close to home you are"". For some reason her words click in my head, and my dream-self realises that it's time to get over my fear of death as it's preventing me from living. I'm still holding onto my grandmother's hands and she's telling me that I need to move on to my next cycle of dreams, and I tell her that I know, but that I just want to spend a little more time with her. So we spend some time together in silence, until finally, my dream shifts. 

I'm suddenly standing in waist-length murky water. It's cloudy and grey. I can't see a shoreline, there's only water in whichever direction I turn. Suddenly I notice the many bodies that are floating on the water. There's a man with silver hair and a beard, wearing some kind of robe, (imagine a younger Dumbledore) and he's standing right in front of me. For some reason I understand that the man is there to teach me 'how to let go', to die for a little while because I need to see something. He keeps on dunking my head underwater and shouting at me ""to let go! Just let go!"". But every time I feel myself begin to succumb to the darkness I panic, push him away. Suddenly one of the floating bodies next to me gasps and wakes up. It's a man I've never seen before in my life . He stares at me and says, ""I was about to die wasn't I?"" I nod, because in my dream I know that he's pretty close to dying and that it's time for him. The man lies on his back again, closes his eyes and tells me, ""just watch, see how I'm letting go?"". I begin to cry and then my dream shifts again. 

I'm swimming underwater, and then the water changes into normal air. And suddenly I'm surrounded by a brightness. Everything is so bright, and I'm just floating. There is no more sky and no more land, just this nothingness. And then suddenly I realise that I have died. 
And I'm filled with such inexplicable joy, and I'm so happy that I begin to cry. I'm suddenly surrounded by all these souls - not bodies - and we're all crying and saying how much we missed each other. And I tell them how I can't believe I didn't figure out ""life"" as a human, that I was so close. And we're all laughing at my stupidity, and my other soul friends are telling me how they were all in the same boat. But that it's expected because as humans we forget all  about our souls' memories because during our 'human' lives we're there to learn and better ourselves. During the conversation I point to some of my soul friends and tell them, ""I knew you were there in my human life. As soon as I met some of you, I knew straight away that we weren't strangers."" And we're all laughing and talking about our fumbles in our most recent lives, where we want wrong, where we went right. 
And I begin to cry again and tell them that I wish I didn't want to go back and that I'm going to miss them so much again. And one of my soul friends tells me not to be silly, that time always flies during our human lives, and that I'll be back before I know it. ""And when you're back"" they tell me, ""we can all decide what obstacles we want next"". 

And then I wake up. 


Holy shit, several hours later and I still can't shake this dream. It's so weird and insane, but the amount of joy I felt when I saw these ""souls"" is pretty indescribable. Has anyone else had a shitstorm of an existential dream that really threw them off?

The first part I remember is me and some of my friends driving into the countryside. We come across this barn in the middle of a field of crops with a tent like thing next to it. The tent thing just randomly flies away with the wind and makes a really loud noise, then randomly comes back. After this we go inside the barn and find this NEET female goth drug dealer who is around my age (16). I remember that in the dream I thought that she had a nice ass but that I wouldn't want my dick anywhere near that thing since she lives in a barn and is probably full of STDs. She says that she can deliver any drugs purchased to your home for free (I never even do any drugs irl). After this I don't remember much about this part.

In the next part of the dream I remember going to the gym I go to irl. But in the dream the gym is all dark and kind of weird. There are still people working out though. I then go into the changing room, there is no one else there and I turn the lights on and off a couple of times. When I turn the lights off I see glowing red devil/demon faces that dimly illuminate the room. They don't scare me in the dream at all, I just look at them and start changing into my workout clothes. Then one of the guys I often see irl at the gym is randomly in the room with me. He tells me to turn the lights on. When I turn the lights on I see him and some other guy naked and one of them has a massive boner. The guy who told me to turn the lights on plays with the other guys cock and does some gay stuff. In the dream I felt disgusted and I just try to look elsewhere and change into my gym clothes. I look in the mirror at the gym and I look like I have severe down's syndrome. This really freaked me out. When I'm done changing and go into the gym start doing my regular routine although the gym is dimly lit and has a weird atmosphere. Then there's some woman doing situps, and each time she does a situp she moans extremely loud in a very sexual way. It kind of turned me on in the dream but I keep doing my workout. After this I for some reason have to pick a new workout from a list on the gym wall. The workouts make no sense in real life but somehow made sense in the dream. One of the workouts was called ""practicing atheism"" and I for some reason choose this workout even though I'm a Lutheran in real life. The workout involves me tying a rope around my neck with a weight attached to it and thinking about atheism. As I do the workout some girl also doing the ""practising atheism"" workout approaches me and starts talking to me. She talks like an anime character and adreses me as ""Lucas-san"" (my real name is Lucas). After this I'm not able to do the workout anymore. I don't really remember anything more about this part.

In the final part I remember me and my ninth grade art class travelling to the countryside in a really old fashioned bus. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, the lakes are completely still and deep blue, the fields are full of golden brown crops, etc. We then arrive at this huge farmhouse with a couple barns surrounding it. We drink coffee and eat some food with the people living in the house. I don't remember much about the coffee drinking part. After this I go and walk outside the house. I then see some guy my age walking into one of the barns with a couple lolis (very similar to the cute platelet lolis from Hataraku Saibou)  following him. I somehow get the feeling that he is sexually abusing the lolis and decide to investigate because lewding lolis itself is a crime against humanity. I then see more lolis wandering around in the surroundings. I walk behind the farmhouse and discover a door. When I open the door the entire room is painted yellow and there are lolis in handcuffs chained to the wall. I then call the police about it and tell our teacher. The guy with the lolis gets in trouble and I wake up.

Is there something wrong with my brain for creating such a disturbing dream? I don't usually have dreams like this.

I went to my desk and wrote down. I realized no one could read my handwriting so I typed it up. Fairly choppy, but I feel like there's a lot to unpack here.  


Basic context: It's about a girl I've been on and off with for three years.  


“We both live in a tall concrete building. The world is wasted around us. You live on the top floor and I live on the bottom. There’s a tunnel that connects our rooms. I can travel through it, even though it feels dangerous, but you can’t. You were the one that gave me access to the tunnel but I feel like you’ve forgotten about it. When I get to your room I can see you but you can’t see me. I feel like I’m just checking up on you, making sure you’re alright. It feels very protective, not creepy. One day I get up the courage to see you again. So I wait for you in the lobby. It’s filled with empty and broken flower pots. You walk down the stairs and we lock eyes. The world fades to black. I come to and it feels like some time later. All the pots have flowers and plants in them and the air feels cleaner. I finish watering one of the plants and start walking up the stairs. I get to your room and I walk in. There’s two twin mattresses on the floor \- one messy and one tidy. I walk into the next room and there’s one full bed, half messy and half tidy. I walk around the corner and you’re standing in a kitchen alone. I hesitate but then I see myself, somewhat older, walk out from behind a door. My conscious moves towards my body and we become one again. You turn around and look at me smiling. I break down. I hug you tighter than ever before and I start to cry. The happiness and euphoria is stronger than any time before. I pull back and look at you one more time. But I feel my heart stop. Pain and fear take over. The world starts fading again and I hear you say my name as it all goes to black. I wake up in my own bed. I walk out onto a porch and realize you live in the building next to mine. The world’s normal, but it’s all in black and white. We see each other on occasion and you invite me over, but never just the two of us. I black out every time we’re together but then I get images in my mind after I get home. But none of the images have you or I in them. Our lives move on drifting further and further apart until I can’t remember you any more. Then I wake up in reality and realize it was all a dream within a dream.”",top,Took a nap and woke up a few hours later from the most emotional dream.,35.0

Along with it, I logged information on my peaking stresses and behaviors that accompanied it each day. I found that on mornings I woke from peaceful dreams, my overall stress would be low the entire day. The opposite goes for something like a vivid nightmare; those days I reported feeling more stressed than usual. Obviously.

I also noticed a trend throughout the month, for every nightmare I had was one ""beautiful dream"" you could call it. It seemed my dreams operated from some subconscious pattern that I have no control over. The cycle never would be affected by experiences from the previous day except the very content within the dream such as objects or environments.

I tossed data on days where I woke up too early or late, or did not remember my dream to maintain a more solid analysis.

These are my experiences and others will have different cycles or no cycles at all with their dreams. Just curious if our Dreams are blindly setting us up for the day ahead.",top,Do our Dreams influence how we feel throughout the day?,42.0

While we were working on it two little kids started shouting obscenities at my dad and making fun of him. I looked around to see where their voices were coming from and they were coming from the other side of the fence in our backyard.  
  
I shouted back at them and they mocked me saying that there was nothing I could do about it. I laughed and said, ""Wanna bet?"" then gave chase. I had to hop over three chain link fences and in the dream I did it almost effortlessly. It was an incredible feeling (especially since there's no way I'd ever be able to hop a fence like that in real life).  
  
Eventually I caught up to both of them as they were having difficulty hopping over the fourth fence. I threw them both down to the ground a bashed their faces 'till they were bloody.

In my dream I was talking with my aunt about something I can't recall when suddenly everything around me changed and I found myself staring at a doctor with a newborn in his hands. The moment I switched places I somehow knew that I was in a hospital and my mother had just given birth to a boy. My brother (in real life I don't have a brother).

I don't know if this is common but I had a very very complicate feeling, I felt like ""Oh yes and now I am going to continue my life being him (the baby, my brother), yes, this is absolutely normal, this is what always happens"" (but the words did not play in my mind, I just... felt them?). I am 15 and in my dream I must have been like 13 or 14 at the moment of the birth, but suddenly I was looking at myself, I was my newborn brother, and I continued to be him for the rest of my dream.

From there at least 11 years went by. I know it was so long because I lived every second of it, though since I woke up I have forgotten a lot, I still can remember random things like they were part of my life if I make an effort. I'd like to remind you that during this time I wasn't in my body, but in my brother's.

That's complicated. See, I knew during my dream that I was myself, John, only that I was not in my body, no. I was blonde and had blue eyes, whereas in real life I have dark hair and brown eyes. I was my brother, Lucas, (who again, I don't actually have) and I still remembered my entire lifetime as John, everything that had happened in real life; and I could see the ""real"" me, my older brother, going on with his life. To conclude the explanation, there are two brothers, John, the elder and Lucas, the youngster; At the start I was John, but when Lucas was born I became him while still having the same personality and keeping my memories as John. I hope you can understand

During my life as Lucas, John (I) changed. He became a different person from me, an empty shell of my art loving self.

This is how it ended: When I was around 12 or 13 in the dream I asked my dad if he liked my hair, he said ""No, but your mother adores it"" and then he disappeared and the room changed its colour just as my mother entered and asked me if I was going to use my jacket today, I said ""I am my brother"" and she left laughing just as I found myself in a different room, in my real life school. I remembered that in 8th grade I had a teacher who I really admired and liked, so I left the room and went looking for him. I walked to his office and he was sitting at his desk, I said I needed to talk with him, he said ""what about?"" And I said ""if I told you you'd think I'm crazy and send me away"" and he said ""sorry, I don't speak English that well"" and it was when I realized that my entire dream I had been talking in English when it's not my country's language. I said ""I am my brother"" in Spanish and then explained him the situation. He was astonished but then he started talking nonsense and I woke up.

What the hell does this dream mean?

When I was 11 my grandfather started really struggling with diabetes and almost lost his life. Over the years it has gotten progressively worse. This year he was diagnosed with lung cancer and he now does dialysis three times a week, chemo once a week, and radiation once a week. My grandmother has been taking it really hard. I'm now 21 and live out on my own (I have been since I was 18). About 4 months ago I had a dream that I was hovering over my grandparents bed and my grandma was crying. All of a sudden my toy poodle (that lives with my grandparents) stood up on the bed and started growling and barking at me. But it was like I was a ghost. My grandma got up and went into the bathroom and then sat at her usual spot at the kitchen table crying still. Buddie growled as I finally got myself from the air to the floor and sat in the chair across from her. Then he started wagging his tail. I tried to tell my grandma that it was going to be okay and not to cry. Buddie (still wagging) laid at my feet. I then saw her reach for the phone and dial numbers. 10 or so seconds later I woke up to my phone ringing, I didn't realize I had dreamt this (I breifly thought that my dream was reality). I  told her not to cry. She tried telling me she wasn't. I then described to her everything that had happened (that I thought I was physically in her house and not asleep) and how I knew she was crying. She then jokingly asked me what she was wearing and I described what pair of PJ's she had on and what color slippers she was wearing, I even told her that she had left her glasses in the bathroom because she didn't have them on when she came out (but did when she went in). She then quietly told me that my brain was getting better and that my dog gave me away so she called me to wake me up.

0.0,8r1xjz,41.0,38.0,"I've been having the exact same series of dreams yearly, for about 2\-3 weeks or so, usually starting in early July, always ending the night before my birthday. This has gone on for the past 15 or so years.

I've talked with various therapists and medical professionals about it, and none of them have been able to actually help, or even give me a halfway decent explanation for it. Most of the time they either cut me off when I tell them about it, or ignore the majority of it. I've tried lucid dreaming, sleep aids (both over the counter and prescription), changing my diet, pre\-sleep routines, etc. Nothing works, and the dreams happen the same every time.

This year it's started nearly a month early, and it's really stressing me out. I'm finally used to it happening (as much as a person can be), and it starts early on me. 

The part that bother me the most (aside from getting dismembered) is the consistency and clarity. A few years ago as an experiment I damaged a window on the 4th floor. That window is still damaged. If I try changing something in the dream, it stays changed. And I remember every detail as if it actually happened to me and it's a recent memory.

\-\-\-

It always starts the same way. I'm in a parking lot, completely empty aside from a couple of badly damaged cars, usually burnt out. The parking lot is cracked, full of potholes, dirt everywhere. It's in front of a really large building, broken and dirty windows. The main doors are always wide open, but there's lights on inside.

Going in, the place is full of hallways. The walls are smooth, doors are either locked, or missing. Rooms without doors are usually empty, just dirt and papers scattered around, no furniture.

I spend a lot of time wandering those hallways, usually several nights. Eventually I find stairwells leading up. Almost always leading up. Most of the floors I end up on are more hallways and locked doors, a few missing doors leading to more empty rooms. I can look out windows and see the parking lot, and if I'm on a high enough floor, dense woods beyond. 

If I head towards the ""back"" of the building, I can look out the windows and see a swamp. I've managed to reach the swamp a couple of times. Just outside the building in that direction is a very old van, painted to look like the Scooby Doo Mystery Machine, rusted and junked, with 2 skeletons in it, Shaggy (what's left of a green tee shirt and jeans) in the driver's seat, and Scooby (large dog skeleton with a collar) in the back. I don't try go to the swamp if I can help it.

Going up more than a few flights of stairs usually starts me being chased by the Interns. Dressed in blood\-stained scrubs, surgical masks hanging from their necks. Humanoid, but with no eyes or noses, and extremely large mouths full of teeth, and 4 arms with very large hands. They tend to come out of the locked rooms towards the end of the hallways, sniff the air, and then start chasing me until I go up or down a staircase. I can usually get away from them until about 3\-4 nights before the dreams stop. Then, no matter what I do or where I go, they catch me.

Going up is a bad idea, because the further up I go, the more Interns are around, and the Surgeons start showing up. Again, humanoid, dressed head to toe in spotless surgical scrubs, but they have eyes, and wear surgical masks covering the rest of their faces. Just two arms, but extremely long fingers with very pointed nails. They lead the Interns around in packs if I go high enough towards the upper floors.

If I can find a stairwell going down, and head to the basement, I find my way to the cafeteria. A really large room full of tables with a counter full of trays of food along one wall, and a restaurant booth for 4\-6 people in the center. 

I usually spend a few nights in there, sitting at the booth talking with my friends. Someone is usually at the counter serving food. Last year it was the brother of one of my friends. I've never met him in person, and never seen a picture of him. But when I described him to her, she said that was exactly what he looks like, right down to the shirt he wears often.

For some reason, the Interns don't come to the cafeteria. Ever. They hang around outside the doors though, waiting on me to leave. I've tried staying in the cafeteria but my friends always end up wandering out the doors, where the Interns grab them and drag them off somewhere.

Once the Interns catch me, they take me to somewhere near the top floors of the building. That's where the main room is, and where the Surgeons normally stay.

At that point, I'm strapped down to an operating table, and I can see the observation room above me. The people in the observation room are my friends, looking like they're paralyzed, and tied to their chairs. I've asked them repeatedly about it in the cafeteria, but they don't seem to understand what I'm talking about.

After I've been strapped down, a voice from an overhead speaker says ""Begin phase one."" Then the Surgeons gather around me, and start removing all my implants. Left knee, entire right forearm, pins in my left elbow, the anti\-aneurysm stitch in my left temple, the nerve block clip from the back of my head, my ICD from my chest, everything. No anasthesia, and I feel every single cut, pinch, and pull.

That usually happens about 3\-4 nights in a row. The Interns catch me, strap me down in an operating room, the voice says ""Begin phase one,"" and the Surgeons take me apart.

The last night of the dreams is always the same. After the Surgeons take me apart, they stand back, and the voice says ""Begin phase two."" The Interns move towards me, mouths open wide, and I wake up screaming.

Last year, after a few nights of the usual getting chased by the Interns, I started seeing writing on the hallway walls. It started out as just arrows pointing towards rooms where the Interns couldn't find me temporarily. Then short messages, saying ""I'm stuck here too."" A couple of weeks in, the messages guided me to a marker in one of the rooms and a message that said ""I'm Dana, what's your name?""

We started leaving each other messages on the walls, pointing out where the Interns were hiding, and the best routes down to the cafeteria. From her messages, Dana's birthday is apparently 2 days before mine, and she's 3 years younger than me.

We've tried to meet in the cafeteria, but as she wrote in a message right outside the cafeteria doors, ""we can't share certain parts of the dream.""

Just for the hell of it, I've tried writing my phone number, email address, etc. to Dana in my dream, but the message always gets smeared, or my marker runs out. She's done the same, as far as I can tell, and the same thing happens.

Dana is probably a complete figment of my imagination, some way of trying to cope with this messed up dream. Last year, just before they caught her, I left her a message asking ""What is phase two?"" The night before her birthday, she left a reply: ""You don't wake up from phase two.""

\-\-\-

I haven't seen any messages from Dana this year, but like I said, the dreams have started a month early. I'm wandering the halls, somewhere on the third or fourth floor, and so far I haven't even seen an Intern.

I woke up in 8am, because my grandma wanted me to take some medicine for my sore throat. I got up, did all neccessary and because I had been sleeping for 8 hours and woken up in middle of sleep cycle so I was pretty grumpy and hangoverish. So I went back to sleep. 

Falling asleep I experienced that sleep limbo, feeling of being somewhere between reality and sleeping, and then I suppose I fell asleep. 

After unknown amount of time I was driving in a car. My mom was in drivers seat and my little brother were sitting next to me. Everything looked like it had been lit by sunset. The car stopped and I went outside.

I was speaking loudly ""Wtf, am I dreaming or am I asleep"". As I looked around me everything looked natural, physics wree okay, nature were okay. Like I said in title, dream felt extremely stable and lucid. However, I inside felt that something was wrong.

""How can I be here, if I just were going to sleep"". Had I really just skipped few memories and went to town with mom or were I in dream? I realised I had to do the reality check.

 Don't know really why but the best I could think of was getting on ground and snorting sand on the side of road. As I took deep breath through nose It felt like I really had snorted handful of sand and I hurt pretty bad. ""Fuck it"" I thought, ""wtf"". If I concentrated I could actually feel my real body sleeping in bed, but dream felt so real that I couldn't understand.

Then, I noticed that car had been disappeared and my brothers face were disorting, so I realised for sure that I am indeed in dream. Now, this is where fuckup begins. As I walk off the road, to the meadow nearby, I start to think what could I do with this awesome dream. I don't know why, but after walking for few meters I turn my head back on the road and see copy of myself, laying on ground in motion like I did seconds ago, snorting sand.

I don't know why, but my thought was ""Well, *what if*.."". I turn back, pull down pants of both of us, and after I start doing my thang, my vision fades to black, and I'm woken up by pretty shitty wet dream.

So  I'm going to tell one of the craziest dreams ive had the last few nights so get comfortable. 
It started as me in my last period 8th grade class. I looked at the white board and it said 12/19/14. In my head I was like ""wtf it's 2017 not 2014."" I didn't become lucid either. The funny part is that my mind came to the conclusion that I must have somehow traveled back in time and I had to re-live the last 2 and a half years of my life. It was crazy how real it felt too, I was sitting at my desk like ""fuck how did this shit happen to me."" Anyways class started and I was talking to one of my old friends from middle school. I said to him ""dude this is gonna sound crazy but I somehow time traveled."" When this happened the creepiest shit happened. The room went dead silence and all my dream characters stared at me with bug eyes. I got scared and ran out the room. Next thing I know I'm waking up in my bed and sweating like crazy.

August last year he committed suicide unexpectedly. No one had ever had any conversations with him about depression or loneliness or anything. He'd planned it months in advance and it's completely messed me up.

In between his legs was a smaller version of himself in the same position. The bigger person shot up and kind of waddled towards the balcony edge, crying. 

The second dream was just a creepy, black and white entity inside an elementary school class room. He had a noose and a chair, like he was going to hang himself. 

The final dream was about the kids from the TV show Rugrats. All the little babies were doing drugs, but Chucky was the main focus. He took several drugs with the other babies, but always had a bad time. He tried LSD and was having a good time at first, but out of nowhere he became paranoid. The trip turned dark. He started ranting about his fears and anxieties. Bug eyed, he shouted, ""I'm in a loop! I'm in a loop!"" 

A male dream character touched my shoulder, bringing me back to the waterfall. He said, ""Man, I'm glad we didn't fuck up our life that early."" ",top,Experiencing a pedophile's dreams in second person,37.0
0.0,8iurtb,21.0,35.0,"I’m going to start off by saying I am able to lucid dream(it’s really hit or miss), but after a few years I’ve slowly stopped controlling my dreams. So I end up in a weird state where I’ll be aware I’m dreaming, but I’ll just “roll with it” and only really intervene when the dream is going down a route I don’t like. With that being said, here’s my dream. 

It started with me getting off work, which is when I realized it was a dream because I was leaving an office, and not my usual day job. I just went with it, grabbed my belongings, and walked out to my car. I got in and my gps automatically came on and started turn-by-turn navigation, so I just followed it. 

After a few minutes I pulled up to another office building where the woman who normally plays the role of wife in my dreams hopped in the car with me. We had some basic chit chat about our days, but for the most part I focused on driving and she was doing something on her phone. 

We eventually had to cross a draw bridge, but a boat was passing through. I was a little annoyed but didn’t say anything and was patiently waiting for it to pass when my wife suddenly said, “well, aren’t you going to go?”

It startled me a bit so I didn’t say anything right away, but before I could she said, “just jump it.”

I replied asking if she was crazy, to which she said, “you do that kind of stuff every other dream.” 

It kinda disturbed me so I didn’t really say anything, but the boat had finished passing while we looked at each other and the bridge lowered. She said whatever and I continued driving. 

We got home and she began cooking dinner, asked what I wanted and I said I wasn’t hungry. She made a sandwich for herself and sat next to me on the couch and asked what was wrong. I said nothing, but I was kinda still shocked at how she knew she was in a dream. She went on to finish eating and rambling on about her day while I sat and watched tv  it was already dark out so I decided to go lay down in bed. 

A few minutes later she came in and laid next to me and checked her phone. When she laid it down she said to me, “well, I hope you feel better next time,” and turned off the lamp next to her. Next thing I knew I was back in the real world laying in bed wondering what just happened.

Appearance is always the same: black hair, pale skin, messy hair, body type, etc; let's call him, for example, Kyle, since he has never told me his name. 
Kyle first occured when I had dream about some party (prom I think) in high school, like I said above (I was 16) He was similar to my classmate's boyfriend, but in the same time he haven't had his appearance, you know about this certainty in dreams we sometimes have. Dude seemed similar to me and I knew him like for years, but I've never seen him before. He suddenly kissed me, and I saw everybody from my family clapped (thanks mom) suddenly I woke up, and I thought about that one dream I felt in love in random person, didn't care so much after first dream, it just happens.

Later it started to get more weird. He started to appear in random dreams for few seconds, like no dream-generated person would ever in my life do this, and always reffered to others as my boyfriend, even without asking me. Luckily, he was nice enough for me to accept that, because he wasn't rude or creepy. Everytime he appeared, he felt more realistic when hugging (only thing he did in dreams after first one) After every dream I was confused a lot, because my dreams are always blurry, but Kyle? Even when I dreamed about being tortured, it wasn't as sharp as him, for example, hugging me. I started to feel creeped somehow.

One night few years later (he stopped to show up in my dreams for a long time) I had a dream about end of the world. Sky was pink, buildings floated with help of the mysterious energy, suddenly evil showed up and it looked like Tim gate guard from Robots movie. I was looking for help, suddenly I saw group of people, one of them was Kyle. When he saw me, he said easily ""Hi! What are you doing here?"" like he was real and our friendship/relationship was continued, introduced me as his girlfriend again. He said that he will take care of this end of the world, I need to stay safe and I suddenly woke up.

Last positive dream was 2 months ago. I started to think about dreams, Kyle, did some research about that type of dream, again - got creeped out about dream meanings. When I was walking to a train station, I said to myself ""Can you show up in my dream today?"" And he did. Wth.
My dream took place in China. Random dream-generated female friend of mine found some way to escape mafia, we luckily were safe again. I noticed that in empty place (something like abandoned small store) is a box. I opened it. I found a lot of comics (One of my hobby is collecting comics, so I was happy a lot) and took it. Seconds later I heard ""Those are mine!"" And it was him again. He hugged me and it felt real to the point like someone seriously would hug me in real life. He told me that I can keep it because I'm me. I chatted for some minutes with my female friend and I woke up.

I'm writing this because today, for the first time in 6 years, I had a negative dream about him. I was in some kind of boarding school, I was with him and our another random dream friends chatting in social room. I realized that everytime I said something, he was cold, had negative energy about him and everytime when other people say something, he was positive and sweet like in my previous dreams. Luckily I made a new random friend in this dream and helped the teacher, but it bugs me that person, who doesn't change for 6 years, suddenly, probably don't want to know me anymore. 
I hope he won't kill me in future dreams lmao

I don't know how it happened I just know that I'm not 8 anymore and I graduated school a long time ago. The kids around me are saying that I'm being wired but I'm telling them that I'm not a fucking kid, I'm an adult and they are a bunch of assholes. 

Then this random, middle aged, black lady opens the class room door and calls me out into the hall way. She says that she needs to speak to me, so we go to a neighboring classroom. The room was empty except for a desk which she sat at. She asked what my concern was with the class room and I told her I don't belong there. That I'm not a small child but a full grown adult at the age of 22. She just replied, ""I know you are.""

She pulled out a file from her desk. ""Listen, Matt(not my real name) you have been killed. In a car crash. You sustained serious injuries and didn't recover. You died on your way to the hospital."" I was confused naturally, so I asked how I was still standing here talking to her. 

She said that new arrivals got to the place where they first start having consistent memory sequences. In this case, my kindergarten classroom. From there, the process is sped up to remind people of the life that they had before thier death. I must have somehow known I was out of place early on, which she said was unusual, but it sometimes happens. 

I asked her if this was heaven(even though I don't believe in God). She said that some may say it's heaven, others call it something else, but this IS where people come after they die. 

She showed my outside of the building and we found ourselves in the middle of the downtown area of my home. She turned me loose and let me discover things on my own. 

Everyone was walking everywhere, like what you would see at an amusement park, without a single car to be seen. The old antique stores were packed, people carried balloons and dogs were running around without leashes on. Poeple were in line at stores buying things with next to no money at all. I asked someone why one would need money in this after life. They said it's not required but people can do what they want now. If that means that they still feel like they want to work and not just sit back and enjoy thier new ""life"" they can for a little money without the stress or real life bills.

Then suddenly I was convinced I was dead. I saw someone I went to school with who had killed himself. We weren't good friends but we had a few classes to together. I went to go walk up to him but I was stopped by another friend who I knew wasn't dead. 

We both looked at each other weirdly. I asked her if she had died and came here. She said no but she's guessing that I did. I asked her how she knew and she said that my face was covered in scars and blood. I looked in a nearby window and saw nothing of the sort. 

She then said that people who are very religious, Christian or otherwise come to this place. That THIS place can be many places. It can be for anyone who calls anywhere home. 

The thought of me actually being dead finally set in, I got really light headed and passed out. In darkness I thought about all the things I hadn't done in real life. 

Suddenly I felt a smack on my face from someone shining a flashlight in my eyes. He asked me where I was and I just said that I'm dead and I'm home. He just replied to me in a nonchalant tone, ""yeah aren't we all?"" He told his friends that I seemed to be okay and so they left me sitting in the street. 

It was close to night time. I got up started walking to wards a place where I thought home was. About 200 me outside town was a huge wall of an abstract nature that acted like a gateway to home. Once I stepped through I was at the house I lived at when I was about 1-3 years old. 

I went inside and just saw my grandfather(who I think of as a father) sitting down on a huge chair in the living room. He was wearing a golden crown but it had no jewels on it. 

I was surprised to see him since I knew he wasn't dead. ""Are you dead?"" I asked. He didn't answer me. He just took of his crown, stood up and placed it on my head. He smiled again and went to hug me.

For some reason the flat (apartment for the Americans) wasn't burned at all, yet still basic. I was on the bed and making prank calls to work with one of my mates because we were bored and waiting for the fire department to come and get us as the stairs had been destroyed. 

&#x200B;

So during the prank calls, we had someone in work pick up and scream at me that I was a ""Thot"" and that the EU is banning memes because of me wasting their time (PS: I work at Dominos). I politely told whoever it was to ""F\*ck off"" and then slammed the phone to the floor, irritating my mate as it smashed and he was now mega bored. He put hois fingers to his eyeballs and started humming oddly, and the door top the flat bursts open and in skip several lifelike memes.

&#x200B;

That cancerous ""Jonny Jonny"" meme was there too and I immediately tried for the window, but got held back by someone and got thrown onto the bed. It was a ""real life"" Anime character and they started screaming Japanese at me. At this point I knew fine well I was dreaming so I crossed my legs, held my arms down like I was meditating and floated into the air out of the window, leaving my mate to feel the wrath of the memes. Once outside and high in the air, I could see the anime flying towards me and I got annoyed/scared, so I clicked my fingers in the dream and a carbon copy of the Enola Gay flew in from utterly nowhere and dropped several nukes on the flat.

My friend survived, the fire service showed up and questioned us both and my friend just kept crying and saying it was America's fault. I asked him what he was so upset about and his porn had been destroyed by the bombs.

So, there's this guy I've been following online for quite some time. He's a small but pretty well known content creator, I interact with him quite a lot, and he's a cool guy. I've never imagined anything with him though, he's not my type, etc. I do like his character and some of his talents/interests though, I'll call him X.

In my dream, I suddenly found myself in his house with him and a good friend of his (whom I also know). I don't even know how I got there, it didn't feel like we had really known each other IRL before I just turned up in there, it was like we had seen each other for the first time and were attracted to each other immediately. His friend was just walking around the room, searching for something, and suddenly X and I just lock eyes and start kissing, like we had been waiting to.

We just kind of try to get out of the room as fast as possible, get to his room, and start making out more. It felt like we were telling each other how much we liked each other inbetween, but without words, it just sort of.. transpired. We're about to hop into bed together, I'm already under the covers, when two friends of his turn up and I hide. I just look to X from my hiding spot and we have to try really hard not to start laughing. His friends see me, then just smile and leave the room.

We just look at each other a bit awkwardly, but it's super comfortable and stuff. Then he just whips out a condom, lies next to me, and we joke a bit. I say 'I haven't done this much, I bet this is gonna be fun' and he laughs and says 'well, then here's to making the best of your expectations'. We just look at each other and then the dream just *ends*.

I have never dreamt of a sexual experience, and this wasn't very sexual either, it was rather sweet with the sex part sprinkled in there.

I remember the first time he told me about it. We had been at a friend's birthday party and we were walking to the car. He casually mentioned that he'd experienced it all before. I wasn't quite sure what he was talking about, so I asked him to explain.

He said that he had dreamt about it. It wasn't the first time that one of his dreams had come true either. He said it has happened a lot - but he usually never knows what's going on until it actually happens.

Case in point, he remembers dreaming about being with his friend, being with two women, and another couple, all hanging out at a specific place in the city. He said what he remembers about the dream is that he didn't know who the women were in the dream, he just knew he was with his friend, and that they were with two women. He said he remembers it very vividly - one of the women in the dream was me. This was a dream that he had had years ago (before he even met me) - one that he wouldn't call anything out of the ordinary, but as soon as we were physically in the location and the other couple arrived he knew it had happened before.

He then explained that another social gathering we had gone to earlier in the year was something that he had dreamt before. We were visiting my sister and she had invited some of her friends to join us at a restaurant. He had never met these people before, so we all had a good time. He said that he had dreamt that before too - and that I was the same woman in that particular dream. He said he never knew who it was, but I was always there.

What makes me think that we're made for eachother is that when I first noticed him I had never talked to him before. He frequented the store that I worked at, but he was never my customer. One day, out of nowhere I got the most incredible urge to talk to him. I didn't even know his name. A voice inside my head told me to do it - NOW - and so I did. We became friends incredibly fast, and after he told me about the dreams (after we started dating) I never once questioned if we were supposed to be together.

He took his life just this past August and I wear a Suicide awareness bracelet with his name on it every day. 

Anyway, in my dream, I was out at the local pub. None of my usual friends were in the dream, I don't even drink anymore and I have never been one to head out there alone but I was there. 

I was doing karaoke, which I do from time to time. Then I went outside for a smoke. 

When I stepped out the door, there he was, about to walk in. I just froze. I tried to speak but everything in my body was gearing up for an emotional explosion. 

I just kept saying, ""You're alive. Oh my god. You're alive!"" And when my body finally let me move, I threw myself at him and hugged him as tight as I could. 

I hugged him and cried and didn't want to let go. I was trying to explain to him the whole dream that everyone thought he was dead. 

There was a woman there that, in my DREAM, I knew she was someone that EVERYONE knew and trusted and I grabbed her arm and said, ""Look. I'm not crazy right, he's really there?"" 

She looked and said, ""Oh my god. He's alive!"" 

She then drew everyone's attention to him and everyone was hugging him and telling him how happy they were to see him. 

His family was no where to be seen and I followed him around the bar telling him he needed to go see them, they all think he's dead. He wouldn't talk about them and kept walking away. 

I stuck near him. I kept telling myself it was a miracle he was there. I could feel him. I could touch his arm. I could smell his familiar smell. I honestly had no idea I even recognized his natural scent but I guess when you hug someone enough, or they're you're tattoo artist and thus always in close proximity, you take notice of things without actually realizing you are. 

Here's where I get confused though. My friend and I never had anything more than friendship on either side. He was happily married to an amazing woman I love and adore to pieces. We all hung out together and there was never the slightest hint of anything more. 

Yet, at this point in the dream, I was trying to make him understand how devastated we've been without him. I was showing him my bracelet. I was telling him how it never seemed real that he of all people could take his own life. 

He sat next to me on this couch that doesn't really exist in the middle of the bar. I just kept brushing his arm, reassuring myself he was there. Then, he just smiled at me and told me he didn't know I cared so much. I smacked him in a gentle, playful way and told him to shut up.

Suddenly, we were close enough that again, I could smell him. And then he was kissing me. It was very intense and turned into groping and making out and his hands reaching places that never in a thousand years would I have been close enough to him for him to touch in life.

Suddenly that stopped. And he took my hand. 

He then wrote down this paragraph on a big dry erase board which was a word for word repeat of a conversation we had had about seeing people struggle you wouldn't expect to. Suddenly, I understood. 

Like, suddenly, I was realizing how bad it had been for him even as he brushed it off. 

I just kept holding his hand and looking at his eyes and he said, ""I didn't think it would hurt anyone."" 

I thought he meant his taking off and letting people believe he was gone before the understanding as I started waking up happened. 

I tried to hold tight to him but everything around me started to disappear. I woke up sobbing, shaking and really confused. 

Most of this dream was understandable. I lost my friend, I'm still trying to understand why it happened and cope with my loss.

I am horrified. And Because I only have a dream maybe two or three times a year, I usually try to remember them and tell my friends, but this is way too embarrassing to recount to any human person... so here's a throw-away & explanation:

In the dream I was at a club dancing with two of my real-life female friends who I haven't seen in a while but are notably two that I look up to and want to be more like. We're dancing and having a good time and I start to notice that the place we are in is familiar--it's the set of the Tonight Show (a show that I usually leave on when I fall asleep, but haven't done so in months, as I don't have a TV in my room anymore). We go to get drinks at this upper deck area and there he is--in his suit and all from the show--Jimmy Fallon. My friends congratulate him for a good show and he's nice back but there's this sadness in his eyes. He's fiddling with his glass and my heart starts to race. My friends head back but I get to talking with him. He tells me that he feels isolated from the world and I tell him I understand. We get away to this like loft area above the dance floor where we can talk. It has a bed, so we sit on the bed and talk, play cards, drink. He takes off his suit jacket and rolls up his sleeves, checks the dance floor as the party is dying down and waves to some people. For some reason I feel that the sleeves rolled back and his arms kind of flexing are just the hottest thing I've ever seen. He asks me if I'll stay the night and I agree. Somehow I go off to a private restroom and change into these silky Victoria's Secret pajamas I own in real life, and then I return to a quiet empty loft in the quiet, now-empty studio.

As we walked,  she swung from my arms and laughed. I cant remember her actual name, but I kept calling her ""Sydney"", which was the girls name we picked before my son was born.

While these dreams are interesting and fun to think about, they're often nearly impossible to interpret, because they are relative to the user that submits them, and only someone who knows the person very well could have a chance of helping them. Sometimes we can pick up on obvious things, but symbolism in dreams is not universal, different symbols and ideas are linked to different experiences for every individual. We can ask questions about the user's personal life, but these questions are based off of their dreams, and while we can ask certain things, we cannot know everything about the person's life, and this can make it very difficult.

I would suggest that when people share dreams that are very convoluted and/or emotional, they also share about anything significant happening in their life, and they try to figure it out themselves by re-reading their own submission, and they can update their submission if they figure it out on their own.",top,The problem with this subreddit.,36.0

I had a fever this day, I usually get a bad one once a year. I went to bed feeling worse than earlier. I was laying on my right side, eyes closed, never felt like was drifting off.

I suddenly felt better, relaxed, calm. My whole body was still, couldn’t move. Didn’t want to. I managed to open my eyes, and saw nothing but fog around me and my bed, with a light ahead, bright and warm, though it seemed very far off. While looking at this distant light, I saw a shadow flying through. At first I though it was an eagle or something, but the way it moved seemed off. It darted to quick, and looked like it was looking for something. 

Finally, it stopped and hovered in front of me, and as it moved close, it’s abstract misty form became slightly more solid, to the form of a human with large wings. It approached slower, as if trying to keep me calm....Then the thought popped in my head. I had died in my sleep because the fever was worse than I thought, and this angel was bringing me to heaven... the angels wings started to envelope me. I have never felt more calm, relaxed, and reassured in my entire life.

Then... as it embraces me, it’s forehead pressed up against mine, I closed my eyes as it did so and heard it whisper; “Not yet”...

When I opened my eyes, it was morning. Fever had broke and I felt fantastic. My mind was blown. It felt so real, and felt like no time had passed at all, but also felt like an eternity had passed.

Here’s the kicker, I’m agnostic. Religion has never been part of my life and probably never will. I’ve never believed, and still don’t know if I do. But THIS... I think about this so much now.

He'd given me a ride home after a work party one week before I was due to leave that job and the country for a while. That night we made out like high school kids in the car, I was  very drunk he was sober, all our clothes stayed on(no hands under clothes or anything ).

We meet the next day at work , I talked about it and we laughed it off.  He FB messaged me as normal a few times, then I started to notice that he was pushing to stay in touch , so I wrote saying that it was a one off incident. We lost touch and on and off outta the blue he would send random messages like ""How's you new boyfriend?""  or something along those lines or crying emoji's by themselves.

I (F,30) did not respond to any of them , my last message was that it was a one off incident. Fast fwd this year I came back to my home country and went to meet a mutual friend of ours at work and she knows nothing of what happened so she had called him along. It was a quick 15min catch up over coffee so I was polite , said Hi and maintained conversation like back in the days. He soon left and my friend mentions that he had been depressed a lot lately with work and life in general (Physical features , short , slightly over weight, sober for many years because he used to drink too much in the past, smoker, long time single , main interaction for him was at work or online, he's in his early 30's)  .

Since that meeting he has messaged me twice on FB  , both were awkward  crying emoji's.

**I was sitting  on the couch with my mom when my Ipad ( I don't have one!) buzzed , It was from this guy and in the dream I don't remember clicking to open it but It opened and it was a long text with lost of paragraphs that I didn't read cause the animated drawing attached with the text was a guy looking forlorn and very depressed with red eyes , I was freaked out it the dream and quickly closed it and noticed that my mom has seen it but she did not say anything.**

I woke up from the dream , remembering it , lots of thought went through my mind, He is depressed , I'm feeling someone else's depression , what if he hurts himself , when people find his phone they will see all these messages I ignored, but if I step in to help he will misunderstand , why is this happening , I prayed that God gives him peace.

**(7.30 am) I sat up in bed** , I googled ""dreaming about someone else's depression""  I read articles that didn't really help then I went about my day , I had a bad premonition and I just shoved it to the back of my mind. I am not in a place where I can help someone like that ... I have my own demons I fight everyday  and that's exactly why I don't do relationship. But my personality is bright and cheerful and I often attract forlorn souls. I've learnt that if I step in and empathize that at some point I'm drained beyond recovery and so I've been single since 2013.

When I was 9, I suddenly lost my dad. Shortly after I started having dreams about him. They all tell the same story, but have slowly evolved and become more and more meta over the years. And let me add that they feel so so very real. 

At first I dreamt that I just randomly saw him somewhere. Still alive. But apparently not wanting this to be known. I’d wake up heartbroken, honestly believing he was still alive somewhere not wanting to be with me. 

This went on for years. 

Then I started dreaming that he wanted me back in his life. And I was happy in my dreams. But woke up feeling shattered.  

So came the next step: dreaming he wanted to be my father again, but he was now ill, and would soon die. And just the thought that I could’ve been with him all these years, and now that I finally found him, I’d lose him again. 

After having these dreams for a while, I’d dream about telling him how I’d had these dreams for years, like I was embarrassed and how crazy it was for coming true. That’s just how realistic these dreams felt. 

And that’s more or less where my dreams are at now. 

I stopped hoping that he actually was alive somewhere, many many years ago, but I still have these dreams. They’re haunting me. And I can’t seem to stop having them. They ruin my days and make me feel miserable for beliving he was still alive in my dreams. And I just don’t know what to do. ",top,My dad died when I was 9.

This happened a few months back and for some reason only now am realizing how insane it is (i almost feel as if it was repressed) and i cant get it out of my head. I had a extremely realistic dream about 3 months ago where i was in a car with my grandparents driving down a road, a back road, that was unsettlingly misty and very grey all around with lots of grass on either side. There were a few side roads and buildings (warehouse/farm/shed type buildings as it was a back road type of place. Also with some very specific oddly shaped trees. For some reason this dream was extremely realistic and specific to the point where i can remember every single little thing about it (except for how i actually got to the road, its like the dream started there) until i woke up. Now, it's important to mention that it was a place that i had never been to in my life, nor had i even been in that area are before. So at first, i thought that it was just one of those creepy vivid dreams everyone has once in a blue moon. Fast forward 2 weeks later and im about to go on a drive with my grandparents to take my grandma to handbells about 2 hours from where we lived. I had never gone with them before but i was already at their house so i thought i would come for the drive. About an hour in and i have no idea where we are, there was lots of long farm roads to drive down to get to where we were going. Fast forward a little more and we are now about 30 minutes away from our destination and i start to freak out in my head, it is the exact road that was in my dream, in the exact car with the exact people. The situation is identical. the weather is exactly the same, the trees are exactly the same. in the same places, shaped the same. I start to scare myself even more because i am literally whispering to myself ""right up this road on the left there is going to be a gravel lot with a small grey warehouse type building and a brown run-down shed beside it. Also, an old tractor off to the right of it"". Boom, sure enough, its exactly where i said it was going to be and it looks 100% like i said it was going to. to the dot. I start knowing what cars are going to pass us, and when (only 2). im predicting every single side street and building on that road before we get to them until i can feel my pre-knowledge of whats happening stop after we take a final right off of a left or right only intersection. Then everything feels unfamiliar again. I will bet everything i have on the fact that it was the first and only time if been there. I will never be able to explain the feeling i had while that was happening nor, how confusing it was to feel. Im posting this more for myself as i just to know at least if this kind of thing has happened to anyone else, or what kind of thing can cause this to happen because its making me question reality and i don't like it.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your comments and PM's. Its very calming to know this kind of thing happens to lots of other people. I had never experienced anything like it and i have always been a (without trying to sound douchey) pretty ""logical"" person who was pretty skeptical of spirituality and things of that nature.

I have no idea why I had to fly to the North Pole to kill Santa Claus, I just accepted that this was happening. To get there, I decided to rent a hand glider (because those fly lol) and instead of going to a sporting goods store, I went to a comic book store not to buy one, but to *rent* one (because they do that in my dreams apparently). The place was cluttered like it was on an episode of Hoarders, it smelled stale and was poorly lit. The owner was this Laotian guy and as I was explaining to him that I wanted to rent his store's hand glider, we were interrupted by this greasy nerd in a stained t-shirt who was desperate to show the store owner his mediocre card collection which was pride and joy. As the two of them talked I decided I would take a quick shower (because comic book stores have showers apparently) only to find that the bathroom floor was covered in old, used towels, even the (used, never flushed) toilet was full of them. The shower itself was busted so I didn't bother. I got my handglider and went on my way.

So I'm not in the arctic, in the Canadian province of Nunavut and I decide to set down for a rest at a luxury 5-star ice hotel (because those are everywhere in the frozen Canadian north). It down just on the outskirts of this town centered around the hotel and I come across these really adorable super cute feathered birds who are walking down the road and visibly shivering. I panic, unzip my jacket and stuff them all inside to warm them up. A local woman says, ""Oh don't worry about them, dear, they live up here all year 'round, they're just fine."" Still, I think a bit of warmth might be nice, so I let them hang out in my jack for a bit before I send them back on their way and head to the hotel.

I find the hotel is *packed*. It seems I'm not the only super gay assassin after Santa Clause; I'm not even the only assassin *period*. There were some poorly-dressed straight guys who were being sung to by Chris Colfer (""Kurt"" from *Glee*) about how you should wear clothes that fit your body.

After several glasses of champagne and some hors d'oeuvres, I set out again. Because it's summer time, the sun never sets. It's, like, 12:30AM and the sun is still up. My smartwatch tells me I've reached the North Pole and ... it's just open water. The arctic sea ice is long gone and there's just ocean.

EDIT:

so after reading all your replies, I've come to the conclusion that everyone who dreams about high school, the dream will revolve around specific stressful situations.

a lot of you dreamed about looking for your locker and not finding it or not being able to remember the lock combination, I personally never had this dream due to the fact that we didn't have lockers in my school.

aside from that, almost everyone (including me) who commented in this thread has had at some point the exact same dreams, and these are :

1. looking for your class room but not finding it, and/or

2. having to write a test that you forgot you had and you didn't study the material.


there seems to be a pattern, like one user pointed out (/u/Elisa10), this seems like a way for the brain to tell us how we are feeling by reflecting on high school.

In the past few months I’ve noticed I’ve had multiple layers to wake up from before I actually do wake up. For example it appears I’ve woken up in bed but it turns out I’m still dreaming. The easiest way I’ve found to power through these false awakenings is to blink really fast and stress my mind 100% about waking up. 

More in depth example from a recent dream: I realize I’m having a nightmare and become lucid. I can control dream elements and make my own decisions, but nothing I do is changing the outcome so I want out. I do every trick I know to pull myself out and eventually I awake on a plane from a nap. I’m still dreaming on the plane until I realize I haven’t flown recently and this makes no sense, at which point things fall apart around me and I wake up in my bed. Again I have time between when I “woke up” and when I realize it’s still a dream, and something inevitably tips me off that I’m still asleep. Sometimes it’s something subtle and I can pull out without incident and sometimes it’s something full nightmare fuel.

It was about two weeks ago I started dreaming about and older version of myself(currently an 18yo highschool student). In the dream I feel somewhere around my mid 30's I have a young daughter who seems around the age of 6-7 with how she behaves. I have a job fixing satellites and phone towers in what appears almost like a giant national park. My daughter and I live in a large cabin within the park and live a pretty simple life, in the dreams we often go on hikes together, I've taught her how to cook a little bit and I spend a lot of time sitting on a couch in front of a fire place where to my right she sits at a small desk and draws. These dreams feel so real to the point where the other morning I woke up and thought to myself I would go make me and my daughter some eggs and toast for breakfast this was her favorite after opening my eyes and seeing I wasn't in the dream and in my own room I had a little bit of a snap back to reality.

I want to make a quesadilla!"" and in my dream I started making a quesadilla. This, however, was no ordinary quesadilla. You see, in my dream, the way to make a quesadilla was to take two huge bits of tortilla that were shaped like really long pizza slices and put quesadilla stuff between them. Then, you let the quesadilla soak in a sink full of water (water that was probably either hot or magical, the dream did not specify) until they somehow cooked and were edible. Anyway, I had these quesadillas in the sink and my mom was happily munching on my popcorn and I opened Twitter (which I don't actually have) and looked at trump's Twitter. It's worth noting at this point that in the dream, trump is actually also Hitler. He's still trump, but in a weird quantum superposition situation of also being Hitler. So I open his twitter and there is one tweet and it says ""put soap in your quesadilla water"" so naturally I think ""this man clearly knows more about making quesadillas than I do"" and I put soap in my quesadilla water. Eventually my quesadilla was done so I started eating it like a pizza and it just tasted awful. I took bites and was repulsed by the taste but kept convincing myself it tasted fine and taking more bites. I refused to admit that Trump-Hitler had tricked me into making a soapy quesadilla. Eventually I saw that the top bit was very burnt and was like ""Aha! I knew it tasted bad! This quesadilla is burnt! And I threw it away. Inside, though, I knew that if it were the burning it would have tasted bad in an entirely different way, and that Trump-Hitler totally trolled me into making a soapy quesadilla.",top,Pretty odd quesadilla dream,31.0

At that time in my life I was living with my now ex boyfriend in the mountains, north Spain, an inhabitated zone in the middle of iron age forests, my dream place to live I must say.

Well, one completely normal night in the middle of summer I started to dream about a Dragon with fluctuating coloured scales which changed constantly from fire red to electric blue and purple. 
In the dream I had another family, another name and I was living in another country, it was christmas in a happy family home when then the Dragon broke the house, killed everybody and started destroying the human civilization.
The dream continued this way until very few humans on earth remained and the small group I was in, integrated by some children, old men and women and a few young ones as me (20-40 years old) was moving to the north where the radio promised a safe place, the journey was hard and the dragon killed some of us, he could speak in our minds also. 

No need to tell you we discovered there wasn't such amazing place waiting for us (they were all already dead and the message in the radio was recorded long ago), so we moved again to find a better place while spring started, I suppose we were heading to north america because the place in the north we visited looked like alaska and after that we headed south. 
At this moment the oldest man in our group revealed us that the dragon was taking vengeance for the bad behaviour of humanity against their species, he told us about the begining of the world, how dragons were kind and inmensely wise and they gave us intelligence and magic but greediness, fear, and the usual dumbness of humanity provoked a world war against the dragons that ended up with all of them except with one egg, which they layed in the centre of the earth where they knew we couldn't reach it for the precise amount of time it needed to hatch.

After we discovered an inmese grassland full of flowers, a river, an small group of tress and some tiny hills, we decided to settle there. 
We started to construct new lovely homes, to hunt and farm, and we thought life was returning to be good, and then the dragon returned.
This time he wouldn't harm us, he appeared under a human form, but 3 meters tall, with all his teeth sharp, eyes with pupils like those of a snake and the iris coloured and changing constantly as his scales, he was very blond and pale. 
He encountered me while I was alone in the small river cleaning clothes, and he asked me to go with him, of course I refused, angry, full of hate and fear, I screamed and the other people came to find us, he then grabbed my wrist hurting me and said he should take me because of a prophecy, and then all the debt humanity had would end. 
I saw how all of them felt relieved, if only sending me away would gave them peace forever, but the elders refused at first until knowing his intentions, this is the most scaring part, he said he needed a son from me because he was the last one of his species, and here comes the ridiculous yet adorable part, the elders told him that as I was human he should first court me like a human man would.
He weirdly accepted and started visiting me everyday, it was 
awkward  at first but slowly he learned how to talk and move like us and I fell in love, then he took me to a very distant tower in the middle of the infinite grassland and we had sex all night, the morning after I found him looking by the window with the deepest sadness in his eyes and I asked him, he put his hands over my shoulders and said “after this sacrifice I made a new race will be born but I no longer will ride the skies for my dragon form is gone, your son will reign the new ages in peace and light but you must go now forever” then he touched my frown with his index and ring fingers and I woke up. 

I woke up screaming, covered in tears, the pillow was soaking wet as well as my hair, my ex grabbed me so I would harm myself, he was really scared of course of all my screaming, I really didn't know where I was or who was him, I just felt an inmese pain in my chest knowing my dragon was far away and I couldn't see him ever again but I knew this by instinct because I didn't understood I was dreaming. My ex told me he couldn't sleep all night because I was constantly moving, speaking and that he was completely unable to wake me up, he said he shook me violently when he got really afraid and I didn't wake up, he saw my eyes moving fast under my eyelids all the time, almost 12h non stop he said. 
That day I think was the most terryfing and sad of all my life, for 24h I was living with a complete stranger who told me all the time we were in love and who my family was while for me the real life was in my lost dream.

For years I've been wondering if I traveled to a parallel dimension, or if it was a shared dream, I only wish he exists somewhere and remembers about me, I come here with the hope of someone knowing something about him, maybe someone who shared the same dream or another in which he appeared.",top,The Dragon who ended our world,34.0

He shows up in my dreams every once in a while and it shakes me up. 

Last nights dream:

Instead of going to a small party, I went to his grave (never actually been in real life) and pretty much draped myself over it crying. I took out my jar of his ashes (actually do have) and put them into a door in his grave. 

Upon opening the door, I find I note from myself saying that I never thought I could stop him from doing it. I never remember writing it so I wrote back to myself at the bottom, telling myself ""ask him if he needs help"". 

Now, time loops back around to when he's still alive and this time we decide to go together, which makes me happy. This happens multiple times in the loops. But for some reason the looping stops. 

I'm back at his grave with the door open again and ask Satan to bring him back, no matter the cost. My SO crawls out of a black portal in the ground and I'm so happy.

The only problem is, he's trying to kill me. 

After multiple attempts on my life, he finally catches me and stabs me in the chest. I hear Satan tell me that he was always a danger to me and that I got what I deserved.

It looked a lot like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ePXII.jpg), with huge stone doors on the lower level, and some other entrance on the higher level. I don't remember seeing the goddess, but I vaguely remember her wearing a purple dress and having long hair: for some reason, although the river of lightning flowed to the temple and to her, she wasn't the focus of this next part.

>Below, in the temple, benevolent gods were imprisoned or kept. There was one room with a male Egyptian god inside, and I remember standing on the left side of the temple and not looking inside, because I was afraid of that god: I associated him with mummies and death, although he was not malevolent. I didn't see that god, but had the impression of a door being opened there and of pilgrims going in to pay respects to him.

>Where I stood, I saw a heavy stone slab shifted aside, and I found myself looking through the door into a little copse of trees, a forest clearing like something out of a storybook.

Anyway, I was incharge of an apartment buildin. I was flying and invisible and able to go through walls. I upgraded the apartment by clicking buttons to spend money like some bad tycoon game.

I decided that I needed a faster way to get money than just rent. So I held a fundraiser of sorts where everyone who participated got sushi if the goal was met, which it was... only, I stole the sushi for myself, stuffing it in my pockets of holding. I even ate some of it (I love sushi).

People started wondering where the sushi was. Suddenly, cut to a classroom, where all the victims were talking about the grand sushi theft and trying to figure out who was doing it. I knew there was one pencil-obsessed kid in the room who seemed a bit off-kilter, and the other kids were suspecting him.

Cut to an apartment. I was actually in the world, visible and tangible and not flying. The room was dark, with an air of static, and the atmosphere was tense. I looked behind me and saw a flash of a figure. It was Pencil Kid, but he was glitchy. Constantly flashing between his normal appearance and shadowy blackness. And he was holding a bloody knife.

So I decided I needed to leave, and started running... but just as I opened the door, the guy stabbed me in the back. And I woke up.

0.0,9mz0y8,14.0,30.0,"I’ve just awoke from another dream about my ex-girlfriend from high school, from which I graduated in 2005. In this dream I was camping at a popular lake not far from my hometown and she was just a camp over at the same lake. I would be busy with my own camp with friends and such, and any attempt I made to move towards her and try to interact with her was blocked, in a way. Some sort of distraction would arise in front of me or in front of her and she and I would remain separated over and over again.

This has been one of dozens and dozens of dreams about her since we had separated over 13 years ago. Honestly it’s hard for me to think of a number as to how many I have actually had. Sometimes they are out of the blue, and sometimes nightly for weeks at a time. Each dream that I can remember has been a unique setting with reoccurring tones. Sometimes we are together again, sometimes just hanging out with other distractions, and sometimes there are dreams like the one I just woke from.

I should mention that I have had a few girlfriends since we separated, but recently have been single for a long period of time now. We still talk every now and again and remain old chums whenever we speak or hang out, which is sometimes only as much as once or twice a year.
Waking up from these dreams just wrecks me sometimes and I wish they would stop all together. I moved on her from a long time ago, and these dreams resurface a lot of feelings no matter how hard I try to shake them.

This time I wanted to share these reoccurrences with you guys to get your thoughts on the matter and maybe get advice on how to stop them or deal with them in a better way than I have been able to. Any thoughts, Reddit?

I appeared in a ""full-black place"" (I didn't see anything) but I could feel that I am in some kind of open space and... that I actually died and it's afterlife. I had a strange, but really, REALLY strong feeling that God is actually talking/interacting with me.

It's hard to explain, but my consciousness (or God) was telling me, that I was an awful person on Earth and I deserve to suffer for my sins. While all of this was happening, me - or more specifically my soul was crying and regretting everything - that's the best way to describe that feeling I guess. While I was getting to one place (some kind of hell) I woke up crying and I immediately started praying and thanked that I am actually alive and still have a chance to change myself. 

Since that day, I pray everynight and thank God for every single day. I used to believe in God before the dream happened, but after that I started to be more regular when it comes to my belief.

I’m not a big dreamer, but when I do dream, it’s been seldom normal. But now it’s just INSANELY WEIRD. Like 2 days ago, I had a dream where I had to impregnate my own goddamn Mom to “further extend the human race.” Now, I know what you might be thinking rn. “Did this guy drop 10 E’s before he went to sleep?!” No. The shit that scares me the most is the fact that I WAS ACTUALLY ON BOARD WITH IT. Like I think we actually had sex. But she was infertile or something, idk. The next morning I couldn’t even look into my Mom’s eyes. My other weird as fuck dreams was where I was in the movie “Kindergarten Cop,” and you know that scene where Arnie busts 2 kids making out? Well it was the same scene but instead of making out with a girl, I was having sex. I think Arnie said something along the lines of “why tf r u guys fking the buildings on fiyauhh!!” A non-sexual weird dream I had is where I was in a HUGE ASS school with a gigantic mountain as a backyard. The school apparently had a “field day” and I had to race in and out the school finding students and clues for a reason I don’t remember. I think it ended by me being bullied by some kids because I sucked at playing catch then falling off the edge of the mountain. The list of weird dreams go on and on.

Is there a reason for all my weirdly sexual and random ass dreams? Is it a message from the beyond trying to communicate? Is it because of my virgin 18-year old body’s crazy high amount of libido? (If it is, do I go on tinder?) Is this a literary foreshadowing of my fate? (dear God pls no)

Then at some point I received a letter that involved a weird cube, and on one side there was a moving image of the girl and some of her friends waving at me at some kind of amusement park in the middle of the desert. And i could talk to them. Then the girl said ""Hey there, I know you're bored without me, so I thought I'd invite you to my birthday in [somewhere in southern France]. I know you're not going to do such a long journey by train and your teleportation skills are kinda wack, so I sent you this cube. Just hop in and you'll be there!""
So I did just that, and I was with them.

I wasn't sure how I was supposed to go back, but I thought I'd just ask her for another cube home, and honestly, the only thing that mattered was to be with her. As I arrived, I took a good look at her and realized she was pretty much the opposite of my usual type and my friends totally wouldn't approve - they'd say she wasn't the girl for me and she'd make me miserable. To give you an idea, she was quite tall, platinum blonde with wavy hair, and pretty much covered in fake tan. She also dressed pretty skimpy. But she was sassy and adorable and she seemed to love me so damn much. Her name was Clara.

Pretty much as soon as I arrived, I went to kiss her, and she didn't push me back, but she laughed a little and said ""Wow, I'm definitely not gay"". So I thought, well shit, but after that we went somewhere away from her friends to talk. There, I found a hourglass and picked it up. The glass wasn't there anymore, only the sand, and as I walked towards her, it slowly flew away to mix with the sand of the desert. Then, I remember I'd come there by ""teleportation cube"", and that's when it hit me.

I really didn't want to do this, but for some reason, I knew I had to. So I walked towards her and said ""Clara, I'm so sorry to do this... What does it mean when you find a hourglass in a dream?"" A small distortion happened, but the dream didn't collapse. So I grabbed her hand and held it. I told her something like ""I really love you, I don't want to wake up because when I do, I'm sure you won't be there.

So in this dream I was living in my old apartment again and I was getting up to go to work (my old job in a restaurant) so everything is normal and I'm just going through my normal morning routine until I get to work and my boss tells me that they've brought in a hospitality specialist to retrain the team and bring up the standards. He then opens the back door and in walks a man with a giant bald head, his head must have been as big as an exercise ball and completely bald but his face was normal size. As soon as I saw him I felt the deepest rooted fear and started sweating uncontrollably, then I wake up.

So in the morning I'm going through my routine and head off to work I get there and unlock the door and right in the middle of the room is the bald man (the dream man) and again I'm overcome with terror and start sweating like crazy. I wake up.

When I woke up it was really sudden and I let out a quiet ""ah"" out of shock. At this point I realised that I should have known the last part was a dream because that weekend I had gone to stay with a girl I was seeing. My jolting awake woke her up and she asked me if I was okay, I said I was fine and that I had just had a really weird dream. She went to kiss me but when she did her tongue started growing inside my mouth and moving down my throat like some giant slug. I felt incredibly nauseous and wanted to throw up but I couldn't as my throat was now completely blocked. I opened my eyes and I see that the dream man is hovering above me with a snake coming out of his mouth and into my throat, this goes on for what feels like forever and I can't breathe, I'm terrified convinced I'm going to suffocate when suddenly I wake up.

He didn't always buy things (and when he did they were always little £3 games) but he used to come in and shoot the shit a lot. He liked to tell stories about when he was younger. He always said he was in a biker gang and they used to cruise around causing trouble. he said he's been in multiple shootouts and has seen friends die. One story he told us was about having sex with a girl doggy style and then her mum walked in and he looked her in the eye and finished, laughing.

None of us ever believed him, we figured he was just making this shit up just to be ""in with the guys"" at the game store. Some of my staff members couldn't stand him actually, because he was quite obviously lying and describing fantasies. Nobody told him they didn’t believe him though. I dunno, I think he was born with some kind of muscle disease and had been crippled his whole life and it made him happy to talk about his fantasies like they were real and I quite liked to listen to him talk.

One thing I believed him about was camping though. The dude was really into camping, and he talked about his favourite camping spots and sleeping under the stars and stuff. It was actually a common interest between us, and when we talked about it I felt like I was talking to the real Mark. But I think that as he got older his condition worsened and he couldn't do it anymore. On my last day of work, he came in to give me his favourite tent, saying he didn't use it anymore and he knew I was going travelling. He asked if we could have a photograph together too and he’d brought a camera especially for it. That was the tent I took with me when I hitchhiked in Europe, and after 2078 miles and some really heart-wrenching situations, good and bad, it has become something very personal to me too. When I got back to England I looked for him because I wanted to tell him my stories and where his tent had been, but when I went back to the game shop none of the staff I knew were there and when I asked the new guys, they had never heard of him.

Anyway, back to the dream. In my dream I was walking with someone, I can't remember who, in some woods and it was a sunny day. And we were just chatting and enjoying the stroll. And we came to this tree house, made completely of intertwining branches, like a little coccoon in the tree. And we walked around and we found our way inside. And right away I knew it was Mark's tree house.  There was an old dusty motorbike and some dusty guns, an unmade bed and his crutches leaning against the wall. And I couldn't stop laughing because it turned out all of his stories were true and I was so happy. And I was just laughing until I eventually woke up.

I was sitting in my middle school band room, crying for some reason, and JFK walked by and noticed. 

He walked in and smiled, told me it would be alright, tied my shoes. I thanked him and asked him what he was doing there. He said he was teaching a graduate course as an adjunct professor(apparently this was my middle school AND my University), but kept getting lost. I pointed him in the direction he was supposed to go, he told me to chin up, and we parted ways. 

Then, I ran to my best friends, who were still my roommates in this dream(irl they have both graduated). I told them JFK was teaching at our school. They freaked out because he was a former president and awesome(not because he was supposed to be dead) and we searched him in our school data system to confirm. We were all falling over ourselves. One of my roommates said he had been involved in some middle school initiative program right before we went to the moon to encourage STEM. I am studying to teach middle school, so I was totally stoked and planning to ask him about that experience. 

I woke up thinking ""JFK WORKS HERE?"" only to realize I had been dreaming. For a moment I was dissappointed that he didn't work at our school after all, and then I was about 1000x more disappointed and also sad because I remembered he was actually dead.

The majority of my dreams take place in about 5 different recurring settings that either don't exist in the real world or that I myself have never experienced. It's really weird because in my dreams I've even become acquainted with the geography of each of these different settings, like I'll drive on the road and I know which highways will take you where, which shopping centers have which stores, etc. It's all so vivid to me in my dreams, but when I wake up the details are muddled and I can only remember vague things about the geography of each setting.

And it's crazy because I can just like pick up where I left off in one setting and know exactly where everything is, then do the same thing again in a different setting the next night. Recently another setting has been added to my repertoire. It involves a giant shopping mall-type location but it's indoor and outdoor and it also doubles as a school (probably more a college than a high school). Then there are food trucks around too and on one of the lower levels a vast, empty storage space that kind of looks like a subway stop without the subways.

Our first AMA is with **Ryan Hurd**, author of [Dream Like a Boss](http://dreamstudies.org/ready-to-dream-like-a-boss/), a guide to better sleep and better dreams. In [Book Two](http://dreamstudies.org/tag/dream-like-a-boss-book-two/), Ryan delves further into the world of dreams with a look at lucid dreams, life-changing dreams, and psychic dreams.

Two things I love about Ryan are he is down to earth--he's a young guy who knows how to talk to a young crowd--and his books are backed by tons of research.

If you have questions for Ryan, leave a comment in this post. He will read them ahead of time. Or drop by during the AMA this **Wednesday, July 8, at 2pm EDT.** The AMA will be the top post on the /r/dreams front page.

On July 15, author **Chris McClearly** drops by to talk about his work at [National Dream Center](http://nationaldreamcenter.com). Chris is attempting to predict the future through systematic study of dreams. He uses a ""dream bot"" to scour the internet for dream reports (including here at r/dreams) and runs the wording through algorithms. He then uses a group of gifted dreamers to incubate precognitive dreams. Some of his results have been spectacular.

On July 22 **Ian Wilson** drops by to talk about his research into precognitive dreams. His [website](http://youaredreaming.org) is one of the most comprehensive out there. Ian drops by /r/dreams sometimes (/u/ian_a_wilson). His knowledge about dreams--not just precognitive dreams--is extensive.

On July 29 we welcome therapist **Linda Schiller** for an AMA. For decades Linda has been using dream work as part of her clinical practice. She is going to talk with us about how to use dreams for greater personal insight and understanding.

For consistency all AMAs scheduled so far are at 2pm EDT on Wednesdays. We have more AMAs in the works.

In the middle of the night, I got up and started wandering the halls. It was really dark, silent, and still, when suddenly this girl came screaming down the hallway. She grabbed me and told me to *run*, so we did. I chanced a look behind me and saw a man chasing us. I led us to the side/back door, but the man caught us. We were crying and begging. For some reason he let us go, and we ran as fast as we could towards the road and the neighbors. 

I used the phone to call 911, but the operator said she couldn't help me. Literally said ""I'm sorry but we won't be able to help you."" Something about not being able to reach us? I remember feeling so frustrated and exasperated. I tried the local cops but they were being equally unhelpful. Asking me riddles or something. What the fuck? 

I looked out of the window into the other house and saw the man pouring gasoline all over. And then it dawned on me that my mom and sisters were all still inside. The feeling of dread that I felt was the most intense feeling I think I've ever had in a dream. I ran back over to that house and opened the side door, and the man came up to me. I begged him to let me get my family out of there. I told him they were all I had, that without them I would cease to function. He said he couldn't help me, I wasn't allowed inside. 

The house started burning and I stood in front of it and started wailing. I just kept thinking to myself 'My mom is in there. My sisters. They're burning.' Then someone burst out of the front door and I grabbed him and asked if anyone else made it out, and he said no. He said he was there, awake, when the man set the fire. When he did, he said something about this being for Jake Paul and Team 10. What the *fuck?*

I came to Switzerland in 1973 to begin my training to become a Jungian therapist, got married, had 3 wonderful kids (now grown), and I've been here ever since.  I received my BS in physics at MIT in 1962, a MSE in Elect. Eng. from the Univ. of Michigan in 1967 (where I was involved in the early days of holography and side-looking radar) and worked for the then National Bureau of Standards (Gaithersberg, MD -- now the National Institute of Standards and Technology).  With time though, I realized I really wanted to work with people and, with some looking around, decided that Jungian approach was the most congenial, mainly because it took spirituality seriously.

Over the years, I've done research and published over 40 papers and book chapters in physics (holography), ophthalmology (perimetry), and psychology (dreams, déjà vu). My doctoral thesis (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, 1979) had to do with digital photography! I am a member of several professional organizations and especially love the meetings of the IASD (http://www.asdreams.org).

I am on Facebook and am a member of several groups there (including one on precognitive dreams).

I've been teaching dreamwork at the C. G. Jung Institute since 1989 and wrote a Wikipedia article about it (the first part of the article is mine). I instigated a project in studying the effects of dream-telling among the elderly (I'll explain why if someone is interested) and published a paper in which I surveyed what was known (in 1999) about their dreams and dreaming.  My interest in déjà vu goes back to my teenage years and I am still learning about it.  For any interested, Kei Ito and I have a déjà vu portal website at www.deja-experience-research.org.  

I now look forward to the questions you might have concerning dreamwork, the dreams of the elderly, and/or what is commonly called ""déjà vu"" and I'll do my best to answer them.

It was new year's Eve and I left my boyfriend (who is my BF in dream and in real life) at our place to go across the street to check on another friend, who was home alone, and make sure she was okay. I'll call her Laura for the sake of this story. Well, we just were talking and it was late (past the ball drop) so we both started to doze off on her bed. Well then, her boyfriend, who I'll call James, came in, drunk. For reference, I've been friends with James for years now, and did used to have a crush on him maybe 3 years ago before he and Laura got together, but that's completely in the past now. He and Laura are dating in dream and in real life.

Anyway. He was super wasted. I could tell just by how he was stumbling around. And he came to the bed and started spooning me. I just assumed that he thought I was Laura, since it was dark and I was on their bed. But then Laura got up, said ""if you're going to keep cheating on me, you don't have to do it right in front of me"" in a weird exasperated/bored voice. She then left the room for a bit, and James started to get really forceful. I'll spare the details because they make me ungodly uncomfortable, and I dont want to trigger any rape survivors reading this.

I was able to fight him off, and then I just started yelling at him about how he was horrible and a drunk bastard. And Laura came back in the room and got mad at ME for yelling at James. I then told both of them off about how unhealthy their relationship is (which is, for other reasons, something I kinda believe irl too. But hey, not my business, not my problems).

I also read some Robert Moss books, so I found myself looking for coincidences between my dreams and real-life. Throughout the years, I've found many - dreaming about a girl from high school I hadn't thought about in years only to have my Mom call the next morning and tell me she was talking to her at the time I was dreaming, dreaming of a boss quitting and having her quit the next day, numerous times dreaming of random people and seeing them the following day, etc. However, despite the allure of believing in the mystical machinations of being able to dream beyond what is actually knowable, I am the type of person who keeps a rational view of dreams and, for the most part, attributes these to the fact that unlikely things are likely to happen. Keeping with my agnostic outlook on life, I do accept that there is a possibility that our minds are connected more to the world than we consciously realize, but that's as far as I'll take it: a minute possibility.

&#x200B;

There IS one coincidence, however, that I always think back on and I'm like ""WTF happened there?"" Is that really random? Does it mean anything? It's nothing of earth-shattering consequence, but the coincidence is just so....weird. 

&#x200B;

2002. I'm a college student. I have the following dream:

&#x200B;

March 6th, 2002. ""Snail Salad""

&#x200B;

I'm attending a class taught by a professor I know. With me, I had a copy of my book, ""The Quantum and the Lotus"", a laptop I was borrowing from my Mom, and a notepad. I started taking notes on the laptop, but it was too awkward, so I went back to the notepad. The professor was talking about a certain kind of snail salad that people can only lick the snails and not eat them. Because of the magnetivity of the snails, they could kill you if eaten. I raised my hand and said ""You know, back I don't know how many millions of years ago, the dinosaurs became extinct, the main theory was that the Earth was hit by a large meteorite, well, there's another theory that the north and south pole suddenly switched magnetivity and it's due to happen again soon. How would that affect the magnetivity of the snails? The professor was like ""Ahh, you've been reading Dames' work."" Another student asked where he could find some of Dames' works to read. The prof told him it would be impossible right now seeing as how next week is spring break so all the books have been checked out of the library for students to read over break.

............................

This dream made me curious, so the next day I went online (I think I was still using AOL). I cross-referenced Dames and magnetism. It turns out there's a guy named [Ed Dames](http://www.thekillshot.com/dames.cfm) who worked in the military in the 1980s on something called [Remote Viewing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_viewing) \- the practice of seeing unseen targets through ESP. He claims that the military and CIA tests were far more successful than they had ever dreamed. One of his main predictions at the time was that the Earth's magnetic poles were going to switch. I had never heard of this man before having the dream. I thought this was interesting enough, and since he is into remote viewing, I sent him an e-mail about this little coincidence that brought me to learn about him. I never got a response. 

&#x200B;

That's just a tiny coincidence, though, right? It's not that outlandish to think that I could have a dream about a certain subject and find someone whose name matches the name associated with it in my dream. It's the next coincidence that blew my mind...

&#x200B;

I'm working at a restaurant - one of those Mongolian restaurants where you fill a bowl with raw meat and veggies and they grill it in front of you. After my shift I go to a coworker's birthday party at a nearby club. I have a few drinks and spend the last few hours drinking water. By the time I feel I'm perfectly sober, it is 3:30 in the morning. I am driving home. At the time, I exclusively listened to CDs in my car. But that night, for some reason, I felt like listening to the radio. Ok, which station's music will I listen to? For some reason, I got drawn to the AM dial. I wanted to listen to talk radio. I NEVER want to listen to talk radio. I turn it on and it is some sci-fi show interviewing their special guest. Who is the special guest? That's right, Ed Dames. All throughout my drive home, I'm like ""Whooooa, I inexplicably got drawn to AM radio and ended up on the guy from my dream.""

&#x200B;

That's a bigger coincidence, right? There's more.

&#x200B;

I get home and I go to my dream journal to remind myself of that dream. I look at the date of the dream: March 6th, 2002. I check today's date: March 6th, 2003. Exactly one year after I dreamed of Dames, I was inexplicably drawn to listening to him speak on AM radio probably even at the very time of night I was dreaming about him. Not only that, but the dream was about a guy who is into all of this ESP-viewing type of stuff.

Once he came back to the living room I offered him a plate to eat. He declined. (I have a shadow box in my living room that has flowers from the grave of important women in my lives.) The preacher looked at it and said with a tear in his eye that “we’ll sure miss her”. It was like I knew someone had died but not quite sure who. Then my grandpa came in the door with a bag and said “baby, it’s going to be okay we’ll get to keep our phones” and handled me like a medical bag with my moms phone and her jewelry and clothing. I said, “I want her phone!” I heard my mom say, “why? You can’t keep it.” I replied, “I want to hear her voice.” I looked back at the chair and she wasn’t there. I looked around and all her stuff was there but she was gone. I realized I’d never see her again, have her play with my hair, or tell me how much she loved me. 

I woke up crying. Ran into my living room and she wasn’t there. (She’s temporarily living with me right now.) I called her immediately and she answered. I asked if she was okay and she said yes. I couldn’t stop crying.

I had on a scuba suit and a headlamp, but it was so dark it barely illuminated anything. Plus I was carrying a harpoon gun. I was panicking because I couldn't tell where the surface was and I was obviously pretty far down.

That's when I saw two glowing lights in the distance. As I started approaching them I got an intense migraine like someone shoved an ice pick into my skull. When it subsided I kept going and when I got close enough I noticed what it was. It was a colossal  gray eel looking at me with its glowing eyes. I couldn't tell how big this thing was but I'm guessing it's head alone was 30 ft wide and I don't want to think about how big the body was.

I got the migraine again but this time I heard a voice in my head which I'm guessing came from the eel. It was screaming in my head to take my respirator off, to kill myself, among other things. It kept telling me how hopeless I am and that I'll never get away. I tried raising my harpoon gun to the creature but I felt like I had no strength to even point it at him. The pain and the voice was driving me insane. I knew that I couldn't escape and I needed the pain to stop so I took the gun and shot it straight through my neck. I woke up in a cold sweat and gasping for air

last night I had a dream, which felt like visit to a place, where many older and deceased spirits were. I remember I was in the mountains with my sister, everything was covered in snow and was absolutely beautiful. In the distance I saw a bear so I gently grabbed my sister by hand and tried to hide by going around this hill that was next to us, however the bear saw us and started running towards us, I was afraid but the bear actually came to me and started licking my hand and cuddling with me. Then woman appeared, she was with the bear and told me that she put something around it's mouth so I won't be afraid of the bear biting me. After this I noticed that in the place where we were going (around the hill) was an entrance to a beautiful house made in hill. We were invited inside and I felt absolutely amazing there, it was so beautiful and cozy. I walked around and came into a room with bunk beds and tables and the woman which we met told me that this room was were one painter (idk the name) came to work on his masterpieces. I opened the drawers and saw paints, brushes and then I saw his sketchbooks, I started looking through those beautiful images, I looked at the table and saw an old calendar there, around year 1985 cca I guess. Then I suddenly heard a music from the entrance. I went there and suddenly it became full of people. I recognised the song and I was happy to hear it and somebody asked me if I want to dance, I recognised it was actually the singer of that song. I said yes and I felt somebody holding my body and dancing with me, I even stepped on his feet because I am not such a good dancer but he didn't mind, strange was I didn't see him, only felt his presence but so lively I can still feel it. We danced two songs and then I realised this person is dead, (he died in car accident two years before I was born, exactly two years and two days, I only found out the date the morning I woke up). Last thing I remember was some old rocker complaining that I didn't dance with him:) Then I realised it is time to leave and I headed towards the light in entrance to this place and my dream disappeared.
It could sound like a normal dream but it felt so very different than usually, so vivid and full.

Two days ago I had dream which was new to me in one aspect, I was looking at the dream, my character was not present. I think of it as a memory of a woman, it was tragic story from past about jealosy of her father that locked her mother in well and slowly killed her when she was still infant. After this dream I had feeling like spirits are connecting me for reason I don't know. I started to have very strange dreams lately, some predicting simple future like scam or weather, some were full of deceased people and my pet.

Is anyone feeling similar or have similar experience?

0.0,5h18je,10.0,31.0,"The dream starts off, I am a young teenage version of myself (now 44) back at hi-school.  Out in the school yard before school starts I have a friend who has a sheet of LSD and he breaks of what he thinks is 2 hits, but they are rather large and gives them to me.  I'm not sure about doing it but decide how bad could it be, it might be fun.  

I place the sheets on my tongue, they taste like paper.  He takes 3 of the sheets and we go to class.  In class the person who sits next to me is given a sheet and he notices right away that it's a grid of 4x4 doubles and breaks of only 2 proper squares.  He tells me that I've taken way too much, the equivalent of 64 hits of acid.

I tell him that I'm probably in for one hell of a trip and he says he doesn't even know what that much would do to someone.

It's my first time, so I don't know what that even means except I realize that I'll probably not be able to handle it, especially while in school.  I panic and spit out what is in my mouth, but it's too late.  I decide the best course of action is to tell a grown up and get help.

I leave class and go down stairs towards the principal’s office.  It's busy with students and teachers.  There is a hall monitor standing with some other adults near a pillar.  When I walk over to her, the other two adults start to sing a Christmas carol.  She's an elderly lady probably in her 60's.  I tell her I have a problem and she gives me a hug telling me everything will be ok.

""I don't think you understand.  Someone gave me a lot of LSD, and I foolishly took it.  Apparently, it's like 64 hits of acid"", I explain.

One of the carolers is shocked by the news and tells me he'll make sure I get help right away.  He wants me to wait there and he leaves to go get help.  The effects of the drug start to kick in, and I start to see fractal patterns in the floor, walls and even in the air forming.

I turn around and there is a mirror in a cabinet on the wall.  I see my reflection, it's my older self with a short beard.  I'm confused at what I see, I look way older and grown up.  I brush the beard; the hair is a little thicker than normal facial hair.

The effects of the drug with the fractals starts to remind me of dreaming.  The fractals I recognize from hypnagogic fractal geometry which can form during WILD or meditation.  In many of my dreams, this pattern emerges before the dream shifts content and I'm shocked to see the same pattern emerge.

I remind myself that I am high as fuck on LSD and probably shouldn't believe that I am dreaming.  Now would not be the time for that kind of deep reality check.  But then I also thought, maybe I am dreaming that I am high on LSD.  So, I make a choice and go with the latter.  

There is a very complex psychology going on given the original mind-set of myself was that of a much younger version back in hi-school complicated by 64 hits of acid rather than my usual it's just me in a dream.  I focus back on the fractal patterns forming in the tiles of the floor and watch them animate slowly.  It's definitely hypnagogic fractals emerging and in the pattern that I recognize from dreaming.  

I look down at my feet, I am wearing black running shoes and blue jeans.  The floor is now swirling from the LSD effect.  But I am convinced that I am dreaming that I am high on LSD regardless of how real the dream setting appears, which is pretty much indistinguishable from waking reality.  

I tell myself I've been in far worse states and this is nothing.  Instead of being afraid, I am curious about the way in which the dream is being animated and rendered.  There is this translucent almost invisible layer effect flickering which makes me see what many describe as the void.  Just pure empty blackness, but the hypnagogic fractal mesh is forming the spatial geometry simulating the sensation of space.

I realize I am not in space, rather in some singularity of focus and the dream is merely simulating space around me.  It's all a type of CGI animation really, an illusion of space no more real than if a computer had a 3D mesh and was rendering away.  This makes me very aware of the virtual reality nature of dreaming, and I admire that knowing.

The LSD effect does make it hard to maintain stable lucidity because I didn't properly address the psychology of being this younger version which now had my normal waking self, over-riding this identity model.  It is still struggling as almost a dual personality over all my current dream reality checks.

I lose lucidity and the dream shifts instantly to a new one.  In the new dream, I am with my daughter near a park and there is a very friendly duck which lets me pet it.  She is so excited that the duck will let us pet it.  And she kneels, starts to pet the duck which happily receives the affection.

To add some fun nonsensical dream characters Zoe Salanda as her character as Gamora from Guardians of the Galaxy walks over and decides to pet the duck.  Lucky duck.  
The dream continues but it's all about living in a house with a new roommate who is a real scumbag and I am angry because his room is right next to my daughters.  I don't like that situation and complain to have him thrown out of the house.  

---

In retrospect of the dream, I only tried one hit of paper LSD back during my schooldays and it didn't work.  The person who told me that I had taken too much was a person I knew from school who back in that time in real life wanted me to take LSD with him but I refused.  The only other time I tried LSD was with another friend but it was liquid and it did work and there were certainly some similarities in the dream effect and that experience which I can compare.

This was probably one of the toughest dream reality checks I have made in a very long time due to the complexity of the situation I was in.  It was a real mind bender but lucidity was achieved albeit for a short period of time and the mechanics of the dream animating and rendering were interesting as always to observe and study.

 that's pretty much a feature length with an awesome story about love and sacrifice. Also it gets a little weird but its a dream so get over it.

 It starts out in the rain forest outside this broken arena. The arena looks like it has been in disrepair for awhile and it has a really Aztec look to it. I am a teddy bear, which is not addressed by the dream but the teddy bear is a mystic shaman in the culture of the people of this forest. I am with an extremely beautiful amazon woman and we are trudging through the forest. We find a dead young man who looks battered and broken, so I raise my staff and everything turns white.

At this point my point of view changes to the young warrior. I wake up on a stone slab with the woman and teddy bear over me. Next to them is a gruff old man. I awake and tell them my story. I was fighting a tyrannical ruler of an ancient kingdom in the arena. I was defeated by him because he can harness the power of the ""shock wave"" to batter his opponents (kinda like fus roh dah) This king has been known to take beautiful women to a cave beneath a water fall where he sacrifices them to keep his people obedient. 

The old man begins to teach me how to fight and harness the power of the shock wave. He tells me he taught the king the shockwave to defeat ""Stone giants"" and become king. He feels guilt for the tyrant the ruler has become, and begs me to end his rule, and not to abuse my power. 

So later after I have become  skilled in the art. Me and the woman are walking through the forest together. I feel love towards her and I am constantly admiring her beauty. Suddenly the king shows up. He uses shock wave to knock me into the canopy where I am bound by vines. The woman and the king fight for a time, and just when it seems she will escape he captures her.

When I finally free myself I feel a lot of grief. I know where he has taken her, and I know I cant beat him. Regardless I make the journey to the cave beneath the waterfall. The suction of the water has been known to kill all who enter. I feel as though I have to enter, and I know that to enter means death. I have to save the girl and that pushes me to dive into the water and swim into the cave.

When I enter I see the girl tied to the far wall, she has a vase and a hose that give her air. I look around and suddenly the king attacks with shock wave from above and I use my shock wave to block it. It ricochets and cuts the air hose to the girl and I panic. So I fight the king fervently using my sword. He has a spear and he injures me, but I use the shock wave to throw him against the back wall.

The interesting part is I knew what would happen if I made this choice. But I decide not to finish him and save the girl. I pull air from the vase using my mouth and breathe it into her. I can see her coming back to life so I cut her bonds. We make eye contact, it has a really romantic feel. I can feel whats about to happen I don't break eye contact. Then the kings spear stabs  through my chest, and I die looking at the girls eyes.

I wake up on the stone slab and the girl is naked and crying. She lays her head on my chest and it fades out, I am pretty sure I didnt make it.

Then it gets crazy,the credits roll! They are in a strange language I can understand. And while this is going on it shows cartoon versions of each person in the story and how the reacted to my death. I woke up and I almost cried, because that was the most beautiful dream Ive ever had

So I should start by saying that I have a history with weird sleep-related things; I have multiple vivid recurring dreams, I have had insomnia for a while (went away somehow), and there are times when I literally can't tell if I'm awake or dreaming, and I have to check the time to figure it out (although sometimes I can't see the time, yet later I find out that I was very much awake), etc. It's a whole thing, but I've gotten used to it.

I dream a lot about ""strangers"", or people that I don't know in real life, but I know that's only because I see people on the street and somehow I remember their features and they get built in my dreams. I'm not even surprised if I walk on the street and see a random stranger whom I've dreamed about before.

But there's this one thing I can't explain. About four or five years ago, during one of those phases where I dreamed a lot, and very vividly, I dreamed about a guy. We were at his apartment, chatting, drinking tap water. I thought it was another one of those ""strangers I dream about"" moments, but he had such distinct features that I decided to draw him when I woke up. I don't have the drawing anymore, but I do remember it and drawing it, which, I guess, reinforces my memory of him since I don't just remember him from my dream, but also from that 2 hours spent with trying to draw him, and also the final drawing. So I know what he looked like.

But I've never seen him again. Life happened, and I forgot about it completely.

Last year I met a lot of new people. There was this guy whom I met regularly for a year (we were acquaintances) in like every two weeks. Lately, I started to spend more time with him, we became friends, and we hang out quite a lot. I was at his place with some of my friends, and I don't know what happened exactly, maybe it was something about the way he stood, or the moment I looked up, but he went into his kitchen, and it hit me: this is the same kitchen, this is the same guy I've dreamed about.

The weird thing is, he only moved to the city three years ago, so I couldn't have seen him on the street. He might've visited once or twice a year, but the odds of me catching him are super low, especially since I used to move back home for the summer, when he would've visited. We didn't have common friends. We lived far away from each other. I've never been to his home city, and vice versa.

0.0,9bhwzm,26.0,29.0,"Hey, I thought I'd share what games I have played, that consistently churn out enjoyable dream vs the ones that do the opposite. Post your ones as well.

Some things I noticed: 

* Open world survival seems to be conductive to a sense of control.
* Dream inconsistencies seem to resolve as game glitches.
* Content that is hard to consistently ""render"" (like reading, turning around and things are not the same) will result in original content.
* Real game bugs often transfer to the dream, like the water in subnautica suddenly disappearing.

Good:

**Subnautica: underwater building and survival game on alien ocean planet.**

I often dream about this game after playing it, producing tonnes of alien life forms not in the game and new environments. While it does have hostile aliens in the game, I think I always feel such in control that it has never given me a nightmare. Even though i dream about my base flooding and being pestered by aliens, it is never scary, instead it has an indescribable wondrous feeling that I wonder if other people have too. Obviously I don't think this game works for people scared of the undersea. Swimming is a lot easier than flying in dream.  


**Skyrim (oblivion and morrowind most of all) Open world magic and adventure game.**

In this game you are always quite powerful and always accomplish your goals, often with magic, and this feeling translates a lot to dreams. For some reason, the dreams are 1000% better than the actual game. I usually become a powerful vampire or an invisible asassin, or harness the magic to turn into a tornado of crows or other interesting things. The locations are based on what I have seen in games, but so much more interesting and vivid. It is depressing to play the game after such good dreams.

Odd:

**Minecraft: open world block building survival**

Minecraft dreams are pretty true to its game counterpart, I will mostly seek minerals that don't exist in game and avoid monsters, but the world generation of the landscape is always completely crazy. I will get massive square 3000 tall towers in layers with air and caves sandwitched together, stacked in grid patterns. I will get portals to other dimensions or the ground will move around. Some worlds have different coloured sky and fog.   


**Pokemon (main series, mostly gen1 but also gen 3): catch, collect monsters and fight them.**

This one is strange. I dream that I am playing on a gameboy, and then i encounter glitched pokemon. I get really amazed and want to show other people. I catch glitch pokemon and it gets more and more broken. Every pokemon i have ever dreamt was not a real pokemon, they are always buggy. No in game location has appeared, it's all original, and more so, locations transfer from one pokemon dream to the next pokemon dream often.

So, if you are familiar with the concept of quantum entanglement, there might be a possibility that our brains are ""entangled"".                                                                                     I know this might sound crazy, but hear me out. Now I am using ""our "" in the sense of our copies in the other verse. If there is a person like you, with same genetic constitution(100%same)you are certain that he/she will literally think like you, act like you, e. t. c.. , so when you dream, considering you are entangled, you are observing yourself in another universe. It also follows the situation that you are subconscious, while the copy of you is conscious.                                                                                                                                               So, if you think you are controlling your dream and lucid dreaming, it is not the case. It is you who is in that universe, what you are thinking he is thinking. Now this easily proves the situations of people who predict the future in their dream, and it turns out to be true. Their brain is hardwired to the universe in which that works is in the future! Maybe the universe which formed 1 day before ours, so their present is our future.                                           Now their have been many instances when people have got ideas through dreams, like Einstein, Larry page and more. So can we considered that they obtained the knowledge through other universes??maybe.                                                                    If this postulate turns out to be true,then it would be helpful in ways you cannot imagine. Every possible secret of the earth and space can be unveiled by sharing knowledge with the earth's of other verses and taking understanding of the earth by the highly developed earth's.

The world was almost literally lit aflame, there was fire and mass death everywhere.  Blood ran rivers thrugh the streets and the oceans were so hot you could easily see and hear the sissle from miles away.  The sky was blood red and massive fires and walls of pure death raged across every land on the planet.  Everything and everyone was dead, and I stood atop a pure mountain of corpses, bloodied and burned and I looked out into this world and knew that I had unleased pure hell upon it; that I had killed everyhting and was responsible for millions of genocides in a single night.

At the end I knew that I was the only person left that I needed to kill and so I walked off and killed myself and left the world to burn.

I saw everything in such intense and graphic detail that it felt like I was visiting a different version of myself from another reality, and I understand why I heavilly suppressed it, but its still a terrifying nothin to think of.

Context: I rarely dream, and extremely rarely lucid dream. I've had some kind of sickness for years, nothing dramatic but doctors didn't find what it is. I always thought if I ever lucid dream again I should ask my 'subconscious'/inner self or whatever to tell me what is the problem.

The dream: I don't remember the beginning but it ended up with me being around my family. I realized my grand-father shouldn't be there since he's dead and I understood I was dreaming.

Remembering I wanted to talk to my subconscious I called for it. Once, twice, no answer. The third time my little cousin started to change. Her red hair were becoming brittle blond/white hair, her skin became pale, almost translucent. Her eyes became milky white, and she had dark shadows under her eyes.
She had the body of a 8-10 years old and looked really skinny, I could see her bones. She was wearing a low-necked black dress. Blue veins were visible coming from her diaphragm area.

I asked her repeatedly to tell me why I am sick, what is the problem. I was getting impatient as I felt the dream wouldn't last. She never talked, but finally she pointed a finger on the source of the blue veins.

It was a dream about Hell.

It wasn't fire and brimstone and demons with pitchforks Hell.
It was much worse.

It was a flat plain, almost featureless.  Winds howled constantly, strong enough to carry you away or rip flesh from your body.  At the edge of the plain was a series of cliffs and crevices where people huddled in dark caves.

There was no light in the sky.  There was no reliable way to tell time. Only fire provided light, if you were lucky enough to find something to burn.  There was no wood, no coal, nothing we rely on as a modern fuel source.  The few fires I saw were people burning their own refuse.  How they started those fires with only bones and refuse was a mystery to me.

There was no water and no food.  Everyone was hungry, thirsty, and afraid of each other.  Every now and then someone would give in to the madness of the hunger and eat someone.  With almost no access to fire they ate them raw.  The worst part of being eaten was that you would survive and regenerate.  It was painful to even watch.

At the bottom of the cliffs nothing could be seen, but a horrible grinding noise erupted from the darkness.  If someone got too high on the cliffs the winds would knock them off into the pit, or simply tear them to shreds.  If you went down too low the pit would still get you.  So the cliffs got crowded with people whose only source of food was each other.

I was relieved to see that there were no children, but then I saw something about the people that disturbed me.  Everyone looked the same.  They had emaciated gaunt faces, with no sexual distinctions, and everyone’s skin was pale along with their eyes.  No one had any hair.  Everyone was naked, but disfigured to the point that other people could be desired only for food.  Lust was forgotten.  Pride was forgotten.  

One man caught my eye.  He worked hard carving bowls out of stone, and then he would weep into the bowls.  Strangers would come to him and he would offer them bowls filled with his own tears so that they could briefly sate their thirst.  Sometimes a stranger would take the bowl and smash the man’s head, and then eat bites out of his arms or legs.  Sometimes though, they were so overcome by his generosity that they sat next to him appearing almost numb.

He would spend a long time with anyone who spoke to him, and would take the time to learn their language.  This could take years, but these people had a wealth of time on their hands.  He taught people how to fast and meditate in order to overcome the hunger, and reminded them of the simple joy of being with another person and treating each other as human beings.  In time, he taught people how to remember parts of their former lives, and how to draw strength from those memories.  He was simply known as the Teacher.

This went on for a long time.  This place was horrible and oppressive, but he was making a great difference in the lives of the lost.  His followers no longer ate anyone, even outsiders, and defended each other and strangers from being prey.  A semblance of a society began to form in a remote corner of this world, with the Teacher and his word forming the basis of a new code of ethics.  The most basic precepts of his teachings were carved in stone and pilgrims carried his words to the farthest corners of the abyss.

I was most surprised though, by what happened next.

Flanked by angels, a figure robed in light appeared.  It was obvious to anyone who saw Him that this was Jesus, the Lord.  He came to the Teacher and said, “Take my Hand, and let me take you to Paradise.”
The Teacher smiled genuinely, and bowed graciously to the Lord.  “I fear I cannot, for I am needed here.  But you are free, great King, to join me here and help me restore these people to themselves.”

And Jesus was sad.  For several more days he approached people, those who had overcome their hunger, and offered them salvation.  Those who took the hand of the Lord vanished in sunlight from the darkened world, leaving it forever.  Almost all of the Teacher’s followers went with Jesus to Paradise.

The Lord returned to the Teacher and said to him, “Only a few of the faithful remain.  Come, bring the rest of your followers and let us ascend to Paradise.”

Once again, the Teacher bowed. “Thank you, Lord, for your mercy on these wretched souls of ours.  I fear though that you have made the need for me even greater where I am.  Please, take with you the last of my people, and let me remain here to minister to the lost. There are many who have not yet learned the Way, and many more yet to descend into this darkness.  It is better to attend to the lost than to rest in luxury. ”

And Jesus was sad, and he left with the last of the Teacher’s followers to Paradise.

Smiling, the Teacher began all over again, forming bowls of rock and weeping into them.  But he was smiling.  It was only then that I recognized the Buddha.

I had a lot of trouble sleeping last night, and during those few moments of being awake, my dreams and reality tried to intertwine themselves. I don’t recall every single one of the very short dreams I had, but I am trying my best. They may not be in order either.

One of the dreams involved one of my aunts’ cat dying and me being completely heartbroken by the fact that I could say goodbye. That was it. I then woke up and checked if I had any texts on my phone telling me about such an event happening. I was truly worried for a few minutes.

In another short dream, I woke up to my room being completely trashed. There are empty boxes everywhere, furniture that doesn’t belong to me and drawers on the ground. I get up and notice the rest of my appartment is the same and I instantly think “why would my ex do that?!” but in my dream “the ex” was really my best friend’s ex that I was never romantically interested in and has now since moved to Europe. During the same dream, I notice that my front door is opened and my dad is getting things out of his car. I live alone and my parents don’t have the key. I then decide to fake being asleep but I can’t reopen my eyes until I finally wake up in real life.

The final dream I can remember was of me being somewhere undetermined (I was inside a building but no idea what it was) and seeing that a fire broke out. I then pulled the alarm and woke up to my alarm clock ringing at 6:30am.

Last night I had a dream that I was in a post apocalyptic world very similar to that of which seen in the Fallout games, post nuclear wasteland and everything only it was instead set in my hometown. I visited familiar places in my dream and saw how decrepit they looked in the new strange world, the air was thick with a dark green fog and the once clear blue sea was a toxic mixture of brown and green. Although, there was strangely something beautiful about seeing the landscape, buildings and environment changed and warped by nuclear war. Stepping into ruined houses, the sunlight breaching through cracks in boarded up windows, the dusty air filling my lungs as I breathed, it felt so real and that's why I think what I found next caused such a deep feeling within me.

Up until this point, I was enjoying myself. There was something so interesting about exploring this place. But I soon found myself walking into a house, not one I had seen before in real life but I for some reason already knew the layout of. As I walked through the house I came to a small crawlspace on the second floor, crawling through I noticed that to my right the wall was old and worn, with tiny gaps and cracks that beams of sunlight shown through creating little streams of light scattered all throughout the crawlspace, this is a part of the dream that is extremely vivid to me. When I reached the end of the crawlspace it opened up out into an attic like room, a chair over in the corner next to a small window, some small boxes scattered around the room and a table next to the chair with landline-like phone sitting in its stand. There was a small red flashing light coming from the phone. The room was strange and out of place but it looked like someone used it frequently before the world in my dream became like this. The view from the window overlooked several rooftops of houses and there was a treeline in the distance. When I picked up the flashing phone I remember looking down on it and feeling a shower of sadness come over me. There was some text on the small screen that read, 1 Unread Voicemail. Pressing a button on the phone, the voicemail message began to play. ""Hey Lucy, it's me Reuben I just wanted to let you know that I heard about you winning that netball game tonight, and I'm, really happy for you. I know you asked me to be there but I just couldn't because of my dad, I-Im really sorry and I wish I could've been there and I know how much that would of meant to you. I hope I can make it up to you somehow, I love you Lucy, i'll see you at school tomorrow. Goodbye.""

These are real people that I know. We go to the same high school and they are known to be a couple, they are both my good friends which makes this ever the more depressing. This girl, Lucy. Who I have known to have issues in the real world with feelings that her boyfriend doesn't love her, but he does which is clear by the voicemail in the dream and evidence in real life. Knowing that in the dream Lucy died without hearing this voicemail from her boyfriend and thinking he doesn't love or care about her, really hits me in the feels. I wish in this dream the two could've been together when they died, but instead Lucy will never know the true extent to his love or why he didn't show up to her netball game. After hearing this, it really brought me back to reality and made me feeling guilty for enjoying my experience prior to this discovery, finding interest in the ruined buildings and homes then stumbling upon this scene really ripped me out of this ""ooOOo this looks like Fallout, thats coooool"" state of mind. Seeing the true horror and devastating effect that an event   
such as nuclear war could have, really hit me hard and made me rethink a lot of things.

I go back to my food and I see Kanye walking around slowly, looking for Tupac. I'm sitting eating my dinner, praying he gives up and leaves. He eventually finds the body and starts yelling. Police arrive, there are choppers in the air, police are searching the area, everyone is panicking. 

after a while Kanye is outside, loudly conversating with the police. The police tell him the suspects. Kanye then gets on a microphone and yells ""REMY MA, DOCTOR [my name], SHOW YOURSELVES.

I went out of my room and saw my brother in the hallway and he was a girl again. I then woke up for real and realized I never got high in the first place.

0.0,8hgada,4.0,27.0,"I do not know how or why but I have always had dreams that were hyper\-realistic. I remember them thoroughly after I awake. Some of them stay with me for a day or two, some stay with me for years. I had this dream many years ago and to this day it is as ""real"" to me as it was the day I had  it. I am posting here to keep at least one of them alive. Unless noted: none of the following is ""real"" or is it?

Note:

I am not a particularly religious person. I went to church a few times when I was younger. My general proclivity is that whatever is in the great beyond is much bigger than my limited comprehension can process.

My dream:

I was in a car accident. I was driving on a winding country road and it was foggy out. I do not remember the accident but I do know I was in one. I know this because one minute I was driving and the next I was standing on an empty road next to an open field. In the distance I could hear many emergency vehicle sirens and I knew they were there for me. I knew that my car had crashed somewhere along the road and I was spared any gruesome memory of it by appearing alone by this field.

In this big field there was a lot of activity. People moving around and what looked like a big obstacle course. It almost looked like a festival of some sort. I went to investigate. I had a feeling this was ""pre\-heaven"", if you will. That in order to move on you had to experience something to do with all of this activity going on.

There were many young beautiful and happy looking people there, both men and women. They were dressed in the kind of outfits that you would see in a movie about a psychiatric hospital. The women had starched white dresses with nursing caps from the early 1900's. The kind with a bit of a wing on either side. They had white stockings with white shoes. The men also had on starched white psychiatric\-like uniforms. The shirts were like the kind you would see at the dentist, diagonally buttoned up to the neck.

One of the pretty ladies came up to me and was very welcoming. She proceeded to show me the obstacle course that ran about half the length of the football field. Without directly being told, I suspected that I was going to be asked to run this course.

The first obstacle was a 10 foot pedestal which was designed for a person to stand on and fall forward. As if you were standing on the edge of a cliff and opened your arms and leaned forward to free fall. The free fall platform loomed over a flat human sized wooden board with many large metal spikes strategically placed to pierce every vital human organ: eyes, heart and such. I wasn't told that I was expected to launch myself off of it but knew that if I was being shown this that it was implied. If a person survived that then apparently they would move to the next obstacle.

The second obstacle was a slide. Down the center of the slide was a saw. A body going down the slide would be sliced in half. The pretty nurse lady continued to show me and explain each obstacle in the course until the end. Each one more horrifying than the next. Finally at the end she looked straight at me and brightly asked, ""Will you run the course?""

Terrified I sank to my knees, bent over and stretched my arms as far out as they would go, like a yoga pose. Not because, I had to decide on my answer but because I already knew my answer was yes and I needed to summon all of the courage that I could to even start the first obstacle. My face was planted into the grass and I mumbled ""Yes"". ""Excellent!"" she proclaimed. ""We are going to have to take some vitals before you do."" I got up and she proceeded to direct me to a nursing station where equally beautiful and happy attendants were seated at long tables with medical equipment.

Still internally terrified, I took a chair across from one of the attendants. The pretty lady stepped back but did not leave me. The table attendant informed me that he was going to take my vitals and proceeded to take my blood pressure and check my heart beat and such. 

He told me that he would need a blood sample but that I would have to draw the blood myself. He handed me the blood collection equipment and I nodded ""okay"". Just before I was about to insert the needle into the vein on the inside bend of my elbow, the first pretty lady who showed me the obstacle course stopped me with a light kiss on my cheek. 

""Congratulations, you passed"" she whispered in my ear. 

 I was immediately ""teleported"" to my real body and began to wake from a drug induced haze in a ""real"" hospital, severely injured but alive. The test wasn't the obstacle course, the test was having the unquestioning faith to run it. I had enough faith in whatever happens to a person after they die that I was given another chance at life.

0.0,7psct6,12.0,28.0,"**A bit of background:** I'm a straight man in my mid 20s. I'm pretty secure in my sexuality, I think the idea of gay sex is kinda hot, but I have never felt any physical attraction to another man before. I'd probably put myself at a 1 on the Kinsey scale. I also very rarely have sex dreams, so this one stood out to me a bit.  
  
**The Dream:**
My dream was in first person. Me and my girlfriend were in a small bedroom, likely in a small apartment. We were both really horny and were about to start having sex, but I inexplicably started feeling very tired, and fell asleep on the bed.  
When I woke up my girlfriend was nowhere to be seen, but I was still extremely aroused. A middle-aged married couple was in the bedroom with me. The man was chubby, the woman was thin, and neither of them were particularly good looking. They told me that the apartment was their home. They seemed surprised that I was there, but didn't act like my presence was an invasion of any kind.  
I can't explain why, but I instantly knew I wanted the man to fuck me. I wanted it so bad I almost felt delirious, and I felt flushed and sweaty.  
  
I followed the couple into the bathroom. I saw myself in the mirror, and I looked like a smaller, much more effeminate version of myself in real life. I began trying to seduce the man, touching him and giving him fake compliments on his looks and manliness. He was hesitant, but he seemed receptive to my advances. His wife was disgusted by the situation, and she left the apartment. The man told me he was willing to ""fool around"", but he only had a little while before he had to go to work.
I undressed myself, and then him, and led him to the bedroom. He laid down  on the bed, with his back resting up on the wall. He started getting erect looking at me. I felt uncontrollably eager to have him, and I pounced onto the bed and took his dick in my mouth. Although I've never given a blowjob before, I felt like I knew exactly what to do. While sucking him off, I looked up and made eye contact with him, and he told me, ""that look suits you"".  
I stopped sucking him and got on my hands and knees, presenting my ass to him. He grabbed my hips and penetrated me from behind. While he was fucking me, I felt a totally mind-numbing ecstasy. An alarm went off, and he suddenly pulled out and said that he had to leave before he was late for work. Neither of us had gotten off. He got dressed and left.  
  
I decided to wait in his bedroom for him to get back. I laid in his bed for several hours before falling asleep.  
I woke up to the man prodding me, standing above the bed. He told me to follow him, and that I didn't need to get dressed. Naked, I followed him out of the apartment into a hallway, and we both got in an elevator going to the bottom floor. We exited the elevator into a large underground room, it looked like some kind of public bath. We were the only people there. He stripped down and we got into the water. No longer hesitant, the man couldn't keep his hands off me. He didn't make any pretense of bathing, he was too busy feeling me up and grinding on me.  
He grabbed me and pulled me out of the bath, laying me face down on the concrete floor. He climbed on top of me and and penetrated me again. The sex was much more intense than the first time, and he had all of the power. Eventually he came inside me. He laid on top of me panting for a moment, before standing up and leaving without saying anything.  
This is where I wake up, and the dream ends.  
  
**Conclusion:**  When I woke up I was kinda perturbed by the dream I'd just had. I'm not gay and I have very few gay tendencies, but the dream was shockingly vivid and super gay. Anyone's welcome to throw out some interpretations if they want to, but I'm not necessarily looking for any.

0.0,75c6ox,8.0,29.0,"This dream happened about two years ago, but for some reason left a very lasting impression on me.  This is a long one, so buckle in.

In the beginning of the dream, I was myself, but I was a child. I was with my family (parents and 3 brothers) walking through a forest. The forest was in a valley, and golden sunlight was coming through the leaves in the treetops. It was a perfect day, and I had the distinct feeling of being very safe and happy. 

We discovered a small, old-fashioned, wooden church in the forest. We could hear people singing and worshipping inside, and we decided to join them. We walked inside, sat down in one of the pews, and my family joined in on the worship service. My younger brother and myself merely sat and observed. 

Suddenly the dream changed. I was older, roughly 18 years old I would say. The atmosphere had changed drastically. The sky was cloudy, it was cold, there were no leaves on the trees, and everything felt sad and dreary. I was walking with my younger brother along the edge of a lake. We were walking over a bridge that crossed an inlet when we stopped to talk. We began talking about how this lake was supposedly haunted. There were ghost children who inhabited the water. The children were said to wield spears and would stab people who wandered too close to the water.  

Again, the dream changed. The setting was still the same, but now I was one of the ghost children that my brother and I had talked about. I was a young ghost girl, appearing to be about 13 years old. I was underneath the water with a ghost boy who was apparently my younger brother (not my real younger brother, just the brother of the ghost girl).  

So I, as the ghost girl with my ghost brother, looked up from the water at the bridge where the real version of me was speaking with my real brother. I began talking with my ghost brother. We talked about how we should try to scare away the boys on the bridge, that they were in danger and they shouldn't be here, because the demon might get them. 

At this point, I became aware of the story behind the ghost children in the lake. Many years prior, the lake had actually been a beautiful valley. In this valley was a small, wooden church, the same church from earlier in the dream. The people who attended this church were happy people, until one day something terrible happened. For unknown reasons, a demon was awakened, or summoned, and killed all of the churchgoers. Among the victims was the ghost girl and her family. After some time the valley was somehow flooded and turned into a lake, with the church still existing at the bottom with the demon inside. The victims of the demon still inhabited the lake as spirits, and would scare away the living in order to protect them from the demon. The ghost children would wield sticks and poke at people from the water, hence the legends about spear-wielding ghost children. 

As my ghost brother and I looked up from the depths, the real version of my brother and me walked away. I began talking with my ghost brother again. We talked about the fact that we hadn't seen our mother since the tragedy, and that perhaps she was still trapped in the church with the demon. That was a terrifying thought, and I instantly decided that I must return to the church to try and save her, but that I must go alone because it was too dangerous for my brother. 

So I left my brother, and swam to the church at the bottom of the lake. It was very dark at the bottom, with barely enough light coming from the surface to see. There was a back door that lead to a basement, and that's where I entered. 

The church looked old and rotten on the inside, with ruined walls and pieces of flotsam drifting around. I had a steadily growing sense of dread, like I was going to meet my doom or that my mother was already dead (can ghosts die?). Pieces of debris began floating by with messages written on them, messages from the demon to myself. ""You'll never find her,"" ""she's already dead,"" and other such messages. 

As I approached the end of the basement, I neared a staircase leading to the main floor. In the gap between the top stair and the basement ceiling, I could see the feet of someone standing on the stairs. I knew instantly that I was looking at the feet of the demon. The feet were grey, and they looked old and decrepit, almost rotten. I made my way to the bottom of the stairs to confront the demon. The demon looked like an ancient woman, but also somehow looked powerful. She had a skeletal look, like a dried out corpse, wore a tattered dress made of old rags, and only had a few strands of hair on her head, yet she was unnaturally large and terrifying. She had dead, blank eyes, and I was filled with terror when we looked at each other. 

I instantly tried to escape, swimming back the way that I had entered. The demon had not physically grabbed me, but it was like a force was pulling me backward. The escape was an immense struggle, and I knew that I would die if I didn't make it out. It felt like I was suffocating, but I knew that if I could just make it past the threshold of the back door I could escape the oppressive force and catch my breath. I began to black out as I neared the door. I was sure that I was about to die. With a last effort I passed the threshold and was released, at which point I also woke up in my bed, gasping for breath. 

I have a history of long, complex, vivid dreams, but this one effected me more than most.

I'm a twenty year old guy, single and currently studying at university, so the idea of me having kids is still probably quite a way off. But ever since I can remember I have looked forward to the day I can be a father. That is probably why I had this dream.

My wife/girlfriend/I don't know, it wasn't established in the dream (although probably based on my crush) gave birth to a daughter called Lillie and when I first held her in my arms it felt like I would devote everything to her. And the rest of the dream just felt very... real. It wasn't the idyllic, picture perfect image that one would want to conjure up when thinking of these things but it felt very real, even if it wasn't realistic. And by that I mean things happened like I had to pay for something I could barely afford because of Lillie or I had to get an injection so she didn't get an infection from me or something, even though I hate needles. Maybe they aren't realistic situations but because it wasn't all sunshine and rainbows, in fact it was things I don't really like, it felt real and that was made it feel perfect to me.

So imagine my heartbreak when I started to drift out of the dream world and I realised that Lillie was no more than fiction created by my mind. Honestly, I did have a bit of an early morning weep.

I've had nightmares before, terrible ones, but I find the dreams that make me happy like this by showing me something that I desperately desire only to realise it's not real are harder to cope with.

Except in this universe, properties were completely different, and planets formed right away. They weren't spheres though, they were a variety of shapes and they only moved around their centre axis. In fact the planets seemed like they were locked in space; they could not move, only rotate around their central axis. Also, I could see time in different locations but time was only in certain areas.



What was I? I was a single point, viewing myself in third person. Somehow I had survived the inevitable death of the universe and was living to experience this current new universe unfold. It was a lot more empty than our universe, and galaxies didn't even exist. Only a random variety of planets, with intricate shapes.

I recall it all seeming like a simulation. Everything felt fabricated and in a specific order, as if I were in a computer game created by another being. It felt like I had already experienced this ""big bang"" thousands of times, and coming to the realisation of this new universe was depressing, due to the scarcity of it's environment.

Dream 1:
I'm in ancient Egypt and am following Diddy and Biggie down a long lit corridor within a temple. They look similar to what they did in this lifetime but have on different clothing and their facial features are changed a tad. I follow them offering guidance as a priestess of sorts. I watch Diddy lead a mass of people out of Egypt, across a large sandy desert. I call him pharoah in this scene and he acknowledges it and keeps leading. 
We walk through the desert and come to a new place, present day where I then seen a happy memory of Biggie and Diddy in a maroon converable going backwards. They are smiling and laughing. This seems to be one of his happiest memories of present day. We leave the garage and then I see Biggie sitting in a car. He has a peace sign, two fingers, to his chest. He looks at me and says , 'two to the chest should have always been two to the chest' signaling to me that things should have ended peacefully, but instead of two fingers to the chest it was two of something else. He says for him to let go of the anger and choose peace. We leave here and go to a large home with white couches, large glass windows and two little girls. He shows me that he watches over the two little girls all of the time and that even the dog can see him. This is the end of dream one. Upon waking a verse from a song repeats, ""when i see you smile, I see a ray of light.""

Dream 2:
 Biggie appears and takes me to a man named Chris, who I think is Diddy at first because he is also in entertainment, but it isn't him. I admire some yellow earings he has, and am not sure why he has them. We leave here and go to the hospital where I see Biggie laying on a hospital bed. A man comes to the right side of the bed and no matter how hard he tried he couldn't get the blood off of his hands. I can't tell it it is this same person Chris? We leave here and I sit in the audience of a show. I see Diddy going back on tour and he is collaborating with 4 others. One is a long haired DJ I've never heard of, one is Nikki Manage, and someone that looks like Ludacris. Backstage their are peanut butter cups that aren't Reeces, he says these are always better. I see Biggie take the stage right behind Diddy and he is supporting him all the way. It looks or feels like when he goes on tour that he wears something special around his neck, which Biggie gives a nod to.
Also, he showed me someone that Diddy knows that is white that has seizures, in my dream he called him his 'cat' and told me it was due to location or his environment he was in. Finally, he mentioned new york and a woman that is there is a good match for him. He reminded me to tell him that he is in a good place, and that his thoughts of him being in a not good place is in his imagination. That is the end of dream two. 

Dream 3: (occurred this week on june 27)
Begins in Israel, my step mom is there draped in white. She says, ""this day in history Jesus made his pilgrimage  from Jerusalem to Rome."" I begin to look around and see a large ship sitting far out on the horizon. I fly over the ocean towards the ship, which looks like a cruise ship but is for one wealthy man. I walk inside a high end lounge area and take a seat facing the window. Diddy walks in and takes a seat. He is carrying a white leather case, that looks like it holds very important contents. I am excited to see him and tell him I've been trying to give him messages. Another psychic sits down, a gay male, and I tell him, 'how about I give him my messages and you can check them for validity.' Both men agree as I begin to tell him about the other two dreams. A tall black woman dressed in her sunday best, long skirt, flower print jacket and blue decorative hat steps forward from behind me and asks if she can look over my beleifs before I speak with Diddy. I say of course. She takes me to the southern baptist church she is a part of and here she studies my religious preferences, and then returns me back to the ship. She stands by me from this point on and is the primary person speaking with me. I pull out a napkin and draw on it, I draw Diddy's house and a small line that isn't straight leading away from it. At the end of the line I draw an X as if something important is buried here. I draw a pool with a flamingo in it, and a place that is just noted as 'sitting room.' The woman, who comes off as a mother or grandmother says to Diddy, ""You hired Goldman's men."" I see just a quick image of someone wiping sweat from the back of their neck as if they were always hot. I pick Diddy up as he looks weak and carry him over the ocean. There are giant sharks in the water below. He is so heavy. I tell him to let go. This is the end of dream 3.

I'm currently 19 years old, doing the standard 19 year old stuff- going to college, working, sleeping, rinse repeat. But, a few months ago, I had a dream I lived my entire life until I died.

I simply woke up in my dream and kept going like it was a normal thing. I remember details of days I never lived. I got my degree, I married, had three children. I even remember the details of their faces, their names, which pregnancy I hated more and why. I saw my (dream) children grow up and have their own children. I, of course, grew old as well, and died in the hospital. When I died in my dream, I woke up in real life in my dorm room.

I remember waking up, realizing I died, then, oddly began frantically searching for my kids. I didn't recognize where I was until I saw myself in the mirror and I was 19 again. There were tears.

There are times when something someone does or says reminds me of my kids and I have to stop myself from saying, ""My firstborn, Theo..."" I've definitely slipped up a few times.

0.0,1zj9wv,8.0,28.0,"There was a period in my life when I was very young (perhaps 2-5) where every dream I had took place in the same parallel universe.  The dreams weren't recurring in the sense that the same things happened, just that they were always set in this same dream world.  While I can only really remember 2 or 3 actual dreams I still remember the dynamics of this world and I thought I'd share it with you guys.


The dreams would always begin with people I knew welcoming me back, I have forgotten all of their names besides one; Little Dav, who was a kind of side kick and would accompany me on a lot of my adventures.


The world wasn't modern, but rather a kind of sanitized ""disney"" version of medieval.  People lived in houses for the most part but there were also people who lived in the sky, a sky unlike reality it was a kind of ceiling that you could reach up and touch with attic like compartments, once inside each one consisted of an empty room with 4 walls, 4 doors (leading to other compartments) a hatch to get down and a hatch to go up, which lead to another compartment above.  As far as I can remember this went on into infinity.


In a similar way to how the sky was arranged the world was split into distinct layers, there was the top one where everyone I knew lived and then there were layers below with different environments and landscapes.  In the center of all of them was a large hole in which you could jump between layers to get to where you needed to go.


While the world was by and large a happy place I do remember there being at least 2 kind of ""baddies"", I only remember 1 kind in detail, they looked like ordinary people except they had exaggeratedly pointy noses.  I think for the most part I would have to run away from them, although I do remember being able to defeat them by turning them off via a switch on their back.


The world also had witches and dragons, although they were kind of incidental and only featured in selected dreams.  Sometimes I would have to help the witches from the dragons, other times I would help the dragons from the witches.


There was one layer that was inhabited by robots, but since they were unable to jump they couldn't visit the other layers.  I do have some recollection of helping them to traverse to another layer using a zip line but I don't remember why.


As I said before every dream I had from my earliest memories to about the age of 5 were set in this world.  I don't know if I gradually stopped dreaming of this place or if it was a sudden process, I don't really remember.  All I have is the memory and have never ""re-visited"" this place since I was about 5.

A bit of background- my grandma passed away in October 2016. She was one of my favorite people on earth and even though she was of age, her death was very unexpected. We had a beautiful relationship but I never dream of her, but this last week has been driving me insane. So far I had 3 dreams in 4-ish nights.

1st one - we are visiting my grandparents house after her passing. I look over to her room, she’s sitting on a side of the bed, weeping. Head down, can’t see her face, but she is crying increasingly louder. At this point I am alone, all other people disappear. I run over, knowing she is definitely my grandma and needs help, but in the back of my mind the fact that I know she might be gone doesn’t surprise me.
She’s wearing greyish colors, before in real life she usually wore something with more colors. I can’t calm her down at all. Dream ends, I feel uneasy and scared. 

2nd dream - I receive a call. Don’t remember if there’s a number involved or a callers Id. I pick up, I know it’s my grandma. She starts speaking but is raising her voice with each sentence. Ends up SCREAMING so loud I move the phone from my ear and look at it confused as she is still screaming. I don’t know what she’s saying, do not seem to understand in a dream. Im in a light setting, standing next to a kitchen, but it’s like smth dark is coming from the phone. I’m left with a bad feeling. It ends.

3rd dream - I’m a small immigrant child. Everything looks like I’m in some sort of concentration camp. And I’m running from danger. I know I’m in danger but running seems like a game. I see a long dirt road with a lot of holes filled with water after rain. Large fences around me, everything is greyish.
At the end of the road there’s houses. I’m not a child anymore. I get in one of them. It’s dark and empty, just two rooms. I’m one of them, on the mattress of a bed there’s my grandma. Light blue gown, covered with a cover. To her chest. She’s waiting for me. I know she is not feeling well and will be gone soon. Under her the bed is wet. I realize it’s because the body is decomposing but it doesn’t freak me out.
I kneel/sit next to her bed and take her hand, press my forehead against it. I know something is not right. I know she’s dead/dying. I tell her I love her and don’t want her to go. She answers that that’s why I’m the one to love. I cry and know she’s in pain. Dream ends, left with very uneasy feeling again. 

At some point in the house I encounter a massive cockroach and idk if my grandma transformed into it or not.

ALL of them feel like warnings. Idk how to explain it but they do. Something doesn’t feel right. If I dream of dead loved ones they’re always meaningful and easy to pinpoint. I can’t figure this one out at all.... she was always a symbol of light in my life and this darkness is NOT how I saw her at all. I’m left with a feeling she’s in pain and I can’t help.

PLEASE give me any of your ideas...

No.3: Ctrl+C/V from one of my answers - I’m still trying to remember more details and today I remembered that either the first or second dream had an ending. I got into my room, my cat went with me. Then in my dream I got to my bed and fell asleep. 

Immediately I wake up (in real life) trying to open wide my actual window and calling for my cat because I believed she must’ve jumped out of it. There’s no cat in my room, door is closed so she wasn’t in there to begin with. But the fact that I was sitting up, trying to open a window wider (it’s close to my feet) left me uneasy too..",top,"THE MOST disturbing recurring warning visitations from a deceased loved one.

For a little back info, I had this on a girl back in high school and did some desperate things I’m not proud of. My parents were always ridiculing me for being single that I grew desperate enough to stalk somebody to the point of having the police called on me. It is not a part of my life I’m proud of, and I live with that guilt everyday for the past seven years.

This morning I had a dream I crossed paths with the girl again. Instead of running or blaming others for the wrongs I’ve done, I explained how much guilt I’ve been carrying and how much I realized what I did was wrong. I asked her for forgiveness. 

This isn’t the first time this exact dream happened. Now I’m woken up and back in reality, I’m starting to wonder if something is bound to happen. Not in the way of a deja vu, and more than likely nothing mystical or magical. I’ve had dreams where it predicted the future, and not in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Soo after getting into this new class, I've had dreams about this guy, even before I realized that I might fancy him. But idk what the hell these mean, cuz they seem too weird. Let's call this dude S.

1. This one was before I even talked to S
    -So he was standing next to the kitchen door, while my 
     mother was making dinner. He didn't say anything. I ran off 
     to chase my fictional crush who was in the street. 

2. At this point I liked him, but we never talked
    -There was an apocalypse like situation, but with no 
     zombies. I ran to the only food source, that was in the 
     kitchen. In a drawer. Ice cream, that never melted for some 
     reason. My guy classmates all took them, bit into them once 
     and threw it back into the drawer. Then they hid in the 
     bedroom. 

3. Still no talking
     -In our main classroom, no one noticed I was there. I didn't 
      talk to anyone anyway, but whatever I did, no one knew about it. Then he came behind me, and just hugged me. Without a word, we stood there and slowly walked away in this weird hugging pose. Now people didn't know about either of us. 

4. This one is more complex. They were both in the same dream, but just a bit apart. Also, still no talking lol

    -In the first, me and my mother were walking back to our house at night. A load of very big dogs appeared. As usually, I tried to pet them all, most just accepted it. We tried to go into the house without letting our own dogs fight the stay ones. But one very big dog, that was white and turned half snake for a bit, followed us as our own dogs ran away while whimpering. This dog that looked like a mastiff, almost reached my shoulders. He  would follow me without any sounds, slowly nibbling on my arms as they started to bleed. And even when he bit into my left arm, I pet him as my right arm bled. As we reached into the front door, we tried to put him in another room. We would open his mouth, and try to swallow me whole, as I was literally sitting in it's mouth. His skull was that big. I cracked his head but he would not budge. As I walked to my mother, he disappeared. She said there were never any dogs in there, and that I was just dreaming. Later, all my classmates and their friends were in the living room, watching HTTYD3. I sat on the ground next to this guy, but he ignored me. His weird, older friend however, tried to hit on me and pulled me into his chest. As I tried to non-verbally tell S that I needed help to get out of this grip, he smiled and walk out of the house. I ran after him, yelling ,,why didn't you help me""? He smiled again, and walked into the street. I ran after him again, and my friend pulled me back into the house, as I watched him walk away. It was snowing.
