I don't usually remember my dreams long enough to talk about them in any great detail, but I had this one a few days ago and it's still vivid enough to think about.

So, in the context of this dream I was watching it as a movie, and that's something that happens sometimes in my dreams. I'll be sitting down, watching a screen of some movie or show. It is for this reason that the dream wasn't a nightmare, but it was still not fun. Basically, the 'movie' I was watching was centered around these group of men who rescue this single pregnant woman from some situation, and they convince her to travel with them on some religious journey they were on. The woman goes with them, and most of the ""movie"" is just them talking with her, and earning her trust.

Then the ""end"" of the movie happens, where they get into a space craft and leave the planet's atmosphere, to this massive sort of stone satellite they've been building, and it reveals that it's basically a giant stone skull. Now that she's on the ship and away from the planet, she notices when they get closer that there are people tied to the skull, like over its eye holes or to resemble its teeth. The final 'scene' of the movie is the woman now naked, also tied to the skull, screaming and dying(I know you can't scream in a vacuum, but dream logic.). That's it, that's the movie, boom wake up.

I actually had this dream again when I went back to sleep a little later, and it was just as bad the second time. I don't know what it could mean, but it was pretty shitty all around.",top,"Weird, depressing movie/cult antics.",3.0

0.0,api1wk,3.0,2.0,"I've been have a reocurring dream lately, maybe 3-5 times or so. Here's the gist:

I'm in a haunted house, an old, dimly lit, dirty, abandoned looking one. I usually start in the basement and slowly work my way up. There is a ghost/spirit thing that looks a person with tattered clothes and long dark hair. The head is usually down and they don't appear solid and clear, it looks like a possesed spirit. I don't interact directly with the spirit, it's almost like I'm walking though the house reliving someone else's memories.

The first part in the basement there is a small boy who is getting abused by the spirit. As I make my way through the steps up the levels of the house, when I get near the spirit it tries to keep me from passing.

At the top of the steps there is a long dark scary hallway.

When I dreamt it last night, for a change I was pretty aware that I was dreaming, which is why I remember the dream so vividly now. So I tried to force my way through the dream because I knew I couldn't be harmed. But I was still terrified while doing so. When I got to the top, I recognized the dark hallway from my Aunt's house when I was really young. I always thought it was scary as a kid because it was long and dark.

I was breathing really heavy because I was scared and I tried to force my way down the hallway. That's when my wife woke me up because I was breathing heavy in real life.

Anyways in my dream I woke up and left my girlfriend in bed and went on a jog it started out looking like the town I grew up in but eventually shifted to a huge overgrown Forrest surrounded by really old farms. My dream self entered the Forrest and I was immediately overcome with the feeling of being watched and my dream brain kind of screamed “Tiger.” Which from the get go is pretty odd as I live in rural Kentucky and the one time I ever seen a tiger was in Louisville zoo at 15 I’m now 22. 
 
Anyways the dream shifts and I am at this weird house with far to many windows especially to be on a run down farm and I’m talking with the owner and the only words I can remember from this dream was “Yeah. Tigers are native in Kentucky.” Anyway after we are all still running from this tiger we wind up next to this random pool and this little girl hands me this white rabbit and as I’m holding it I give it a pet on the head but I notice the fur on its back close to the hind legs is matted not like bloody matted just like really dirty and I remember thinking about the fact that it was matted and thinking how odd it was. When I looked up from the rabbit both the man I was talking to are on the ground dead and bloody and I’m face to face with a fucking tiger.

0.0,90cbxi,0.0,2.0,"This will be long, apologies in advance. I've recently started having some intense and vivid dreams that are out of character for me, and it's bothering me. All of them have been disaster-themed. To try and condense this, I'll just do the most recent 3.

Dream 1: I was on the Oregon coast with my family walking along a cliffside trail overlooking the ocean that paralleled a road. The trail and road passed through a tunnel. While we passed through the tunnel, a great earthquake struck and the tunnel collapsed. I was able to climb through the falling rocks and rubble, but could not find my family. Knowing that more rocks were likely to fall and the tunnel was unstable, I grit my teeth and struggled through the boulders through the opening I could see up ahead. Along the way, I found 2 children also separated by their families. They were Asian and could speak no English, and were sobbing in terror. I knew that one big earthquake usually meant another was coming, so I did my best to get the children to follow me, though it was very hard and stressful due to the language barrier. I also knew that since we were on the coast, a tsunami was likely. After I helped the children through the tunnel, we found ourselves stranded on an now extremely unstable narrow path, and the ocean was receding. Panicked, I scrambled to get the unconsolable children to scurry up the rocks to get as high as we could before the waves came, avoiding tumbling boulders from the second earthquake as we did and holding on for dear life. End dream 1.

Dream 2: I was in a shop during a storm, and a tornado warning was issued. The few people in the shop went into a large warehouse-type structure that the shop owner insisted was the sturdiest place around. It had windows, and I could see the monstrous tornado approaching. The door in this structure was broken, and the tornado was tossing huge shards of sharp and heavy debris. I knew the wind would suck the door open at any given moment, and people cowered as far from the door that directly faced the oncoming tornado as they could. Without thinking, I ran to the door and tried to get the lock bolted before the tornado struck the building. End dream 2.

Finally, today's dream. I was in a restaurant with my father in a downtown. I noticed some young men on the roof of a large church next door about to do some reckless stunts. I was worried, but the first stunt went off without a hitch. The second one, however, missed his mark and he fell off the roof, shattering his legs. Note: I am a nurse IRL, and though I am not used to dealing with situations outside of facilities where I have equipment and coworkers to help me, all the gathering onlookers were just gawking and not helping the man, so I jumped up and went to do whatever I could with what little I had. His legs were both shatters, with one leg and one arm having bone protruding through the skin. I took off my coat and tried to stop the bleeding, he was losing blood fast. I asked the crowd to give me whatever clothes they could spare, and to put pressure on the other wound. No one responded, they were too shocked. Still busy keeping pressure on the greatest wound, I asked if any of them had called 911 yet, and it seemed no one had, bystander effect was going on. I told the woman standing next to me to call 911, and she did but did not know the name of the street we were on and made no effort to figure it out. Meanwhile, the injured man woke up and, in his shock, was trying to stand up. I tried to get him to hold still, but he wouldn't, he was too dazed and confused. So there I was, stopping profuse bleeding on a man injured in an accident (I don't know why, but I get the feeling that the fact that the man was hurt accidentally and not suicidally despite the cause of the injury being fall-from-height-related is important) who was confused and fighting me off while no one was contacting 911 with the needed information and no one was helping me, just a crowd of stupid useless onlookers. End dream 3. Certain other details that stood out I left out due to length, but I detailed the most important ones.

This is not like me at all. I almost never dream, and when I do they're typically just weird ""huh, so that was odd"" ones that are nothing to think much of. I don't know what to make of this onslaught of stressful dreams. Any interpretations or advice would be appreciated, I can't get them off my mind.

I was in my room, and it was the dead of night, as in everything was pitch black. I looked out my window that highlighted both the main street and the path to go behind my house, and there were hundreds of shambling people, like a scene out of the walking dead, consistantly walking by, never looking up, but walking like zombies. I exited the room, and the banister was covered in red eyed black birds, i guess maybe crows? To my mind, i always just pictured them like a black and red version of Tweety from Looney Tunes, but now, i remember them more as crows, just mingling and shifting, like normal crows would. Outside i think they may have been on the telephone lines too, and adjacent houses. The dream ends there, but i've never been able to understand it.

0.0,7boevo,2.0,2.0,"I was living in a dorm room of my college and my roommate was gone. He isn’t the type to ever leave the dorm, so I took advantage and decided to take a nap. In my dream I was outside of my college dorm walking around. I should probably mention that I’m a very social person who could spark up a conversation with just about anyone. In my dream I was doing just that. At the end of every conversation with each college student they would all ask the same question, “Did you find the secret place yet?”

Very random question. I remember asking this girl who I’d smoke with occasionally why everybody keeps asking me this and what it meant. She told me that their was a club hidden on campus. Nobody could ever find it, nobody was ever invite, nobody knows anything about the club except it exists. If you are accepted into the club the club will appear and find you. 

Honestly I just continued my random dream which honestly seemed like any normal dream any person would have. I walked to this trail by a river that most stoners would chill and enjoy the scenery. In my dream though this river was greeted by a large dock with boats tied secure and it was huge. In real life this river you could easily walk across and make it to the other side. I remember even questioning myself if I was dreaming. I walked around the dock and for some reason it seemed oddly familiar like I’ve been here before except for this door. There was a door that seemed different from the rest of the dream and my curiosity got the best of me and I entered. 

There was a small group of people inside, I have never seen before. They all seemed familiar with each other and dressed in a very formal style and portrayed a feeling of being wealthy. I sat down on this leather couch next to a bar and a server came over with a tray of very expensive looking drinks and foods and asked if I wanted any. I told her I had no money and couldn’t afford it which had the people around me laughing which quickly went back to them taking amongst themselves. The server told me it was all free and I didn’t know why but I still declined even though I oddly enough wanted it. I saw this girl that I was dating (in real life at the time we will call her Jessica). Jessica was sitting at the counter of the bar and I was confused as to why she was here and I walked over and asked her.

“Jessica... are you okay? Where are we?”

She said nothing. She just stood up and walked away from me. Immediately I tried to walk to her but was stopped by some male around my age telling me the president of this club wanted to talk to me. I told him there was a mistake and he said,

“Ryan, we need to talk to you. It’s important.” 

I remember feeling a sense of urgency and the fact he addressed my name made me feel the urge to see. But I also cared a lot about Jessica at the time. So I told him another time and I went after Jessica. 

In my dream Jessica kept walking away from me getting more and more distant no matter how hard I tried to get to her. When I finally got to her she was with another guy but then he’d disappear and she said, “I like you but I just don’t know.” I asked her what that meant but she kept walking leaving space between us. The third time catching up to her she said, “write how you truly feel.” Handing me a piece of paper and said, “then you will finally leave.” I was completely confused and kept trying to read the writing on the paper but suddenly it was dark and couldn’t make out a single letter. 

I woke up and felt so confused about the dream in its entirety and it stuck with me for so long. I told people about it but they said it was just a dream to not worry about it. But I still wondered what the president of that club was trying to tell me. 

Within that year Jessica became very distant to me, when I asked her to be my girlfriend her response was “I like you but just not like that.” Which was the same thing she said in my dream. She admitted to cheating on my 3 times. By the third time I felt played and pulled my phone out and wrote myself a note on how I truly feel about her. I promised myself if she ever tried to come back into my life I’d read that note in hope to forget her. I left the college (not because of her but because of money problems) and never went back. It was like the dream was telling me what would happen in my life but in clues. 

I’ve had a lot more weird dreams, I should probably start writing them down. But I need to know, has anyone else had a situation slightly similar?

0.0,608kzw,1.0,2.0,"Hey guys, this is going to be a long post but I will try to incorporate a TL;DR at the bottom.

So starting about a week ago, (March 7th to be exact), I had a dream of a little girl who was possessed by a negative entity. The entity then left this girl and attempted to enter me, but luckily I awoke before this happened.

Since this initial dream, I have had nightmares every night. I have not been resting well. The first dream included my house being burned, killing my animals within it. It also flooded in that dream, killing my animals outdoors. Another night, I dreamed about my father taking me to a fair and abandoning me, leaving me alone to fend for myself (I was approximately 5 years old in this dream). Another was escaping someone who was going to initiate a mass homicide by emitting some kind of liquid from cell phones. In this dream, I outwitted this woman and escaped before death and managed to keep everyone from being killed. Today's dream (I work on an ambulance as a backstory) I came upon a multiple vehicle accident which included 30+ injured and dead patients. I had to set up triage and determine who was going in the ambulances first, including pronouncing several people deceased and talking with a man with no legs who was laughing, jovial, and generally doing things that would not be expected of someone who had been in an accident where they lost their legs.

My question is, what are these dreams stemming from? What do they mean? Is this because of childhood trauma? How do I stop these dreams or whatever is causing me to have them? Is this because I have been researching and developing my abilities?

My friend, who is attuned to his abilities very well, suggested the little girl in my dream was actually me, and several of these events in the dreams are stemming either 1) from a negative entity that has attached itself to me or 2) my subconscious awakening and my repressed memories coming forward or 3) a combination of the three.

TL;DR

I have had nightmares for a week, starting with a dream about a possessed little girl who's possessing energy attempting to enter me. I had childhood trauma and want to know how to stop these nightmares/how to cast out this negative energy. I also would like to know the reason for these dreams and their meaning.

Thanks for any and all help guys. I have run out of options and have turned to you all for help. With the knowledge of this group, I have no doubt someone can help me.

A few weeks ago I had a dream where she got a pet snake that was like twenty feet long. It was black, and maybe five inches thick. It's head looked kinda like a dragon, and it had white feathers at the start of it's neck. It also had two spots that had gold scales instead of black ones. These spots looked kinda like bracelets. Throughout the dream, we were all trying to convince her to get rid of it because it was horrifying. It was growling at us, and getting really close to our necks and stuff like that. Then, close to the end, it grew legs. They were really short, and kinda looked like wiener dog legs. I told her to get rid of it or it would bite her dog, Jango. She said in a calm tone that it already bit him and he'd be fine.

Then last night, I had a dream where I got a black snake for a pet. It was about the same thickness, but only two or three feet long. We were in a house that I've never seen before, but I guess we lived in it in the dream. My older sister from the previous dream and my two younger sibling were on a bed, I guess it was in my bedroom. The snake was on the floor, and it was peaceful. Then it bit my younger sister, and suddenly it turned evil. We climbed as far back on the bed as possible, while I told my dog, Buddy, to attack it. Not wanting him to fight it alone, I pelted it with somewhat heavy things in my room then started beating it with a whiffle ball bat. Somewhere between it biting my sister and me fighting it, it grew legs and I think it had fur. This time it looked more like a dog with fangs than a snake with legs. It didn't have ears, though.

About every 10 ft on the boardwalk was a small opening in the railing and a spot to jump off, right next to a luscious green tree growing from the water. 

Every time we jumped it felt like a 30 ft drop with no damage, but instead you could feel a pulsate in the water, like the fabric of time had been broken, and it took us to a dimension where time stood still.

Then a few months later the dreams would start again and pick up right where the last one left off. I've tried googling it to see if other people have had this experience but so far, no luck. I do believe in past lives but this dream... I just don't know.

Please help me find answers. Even if you can only help with one that's fine! TIA.",top,two different dreams. I would LOVE to know what they mean!,2.0

My first nightmare I had at their home. I was in my room,  but I didn't recognize anything I had in there.  My fiance gave me a seductive look and I thought to myself, we were going to have intercourse. But she froze and her eyes filled with black ink from her pupil to her whole eye.  Her cellphone was stuck on her forehead and it was a third person view of her but she was distorted and growling/whispering words.  I was yelling her name and telling her to stop. I woke myself up from the my echo on my yell. 

My second nightmare, started out with me going to the bathroom. I didn't care for how the bathroom looked I just need to go.  As I closed the door.  The door locked itself and the deadbolt lever slid into the door knob.  I looked around the bathroom for something to help me get out, the bathroom was all black, white, and grey walls. As I was looking I noticed there was mirrors all around the bathroom, in each mirror there was a version on me in a different outfit.  But there was a someone else in the mirrors besides me. I tried hitting the walls to get help,  but with my full force just about an inch or two from the wall there was a barrier that reduced the the speed and force with my hands, I could yell because my voice was stuck. I managed to yell help, but this woke me up and accidentally waking up my fiace and scaring her.

I am new to this thread but I need help with interpretation of my dream. If you have any ideas please comment below.

My dream was this:
I am a man walking near old white house. Suddenly there is a familiar person standing on the porch of the that house and asks me to come over. So I did. On my way I noticed green tiny snake on the stairs and made sure to avoid it. But the snake was fast and managed to come close to my feet. I freaked out and run to the from door. In this point I knew that the man is me and turned to myself. Feeling food that it won't bite me. But then I felt a sharp pain in my right index finger. It was the tiny snake hanging from my finger. Its teeth in my flesh. No blood or anything. Just very real feeling of pain which woke me up in the middle of the night, 3 am to be precise.

After that I couldn't sleep for a while as the snake showed up every time I closed my eyes. Eventually I gave it up.

I've found some explanation online just wanted to get more opinions. Also, next day I smudged my house... Just in case",top,Snake bite,1.0

I felt myself wanting to talk to her and have a conversation like we usually do over coffee... the mugs were full and she was sitting in a chair. All I could muster was checking if she was hungry and what she wanted to eat. She was a little indecisive but eventually said whatever I wanted to get for her would suffice.

i made a reddit account to tell this story i would like someone to annalize my dream and tell me what it means, if thats even possible. Before i start i would like you to know you should never do this to yourself, i was very stupid.
so one time i decided i didnt need sleep because of adderal, please dont ever do this, im no expert but im pretty sure what i did could have potentially been fatal but i got lucky this time.
just to preface this story i had slept very little for almost a week, probly 3 hours in total. i had been taking adderal at 6:00 am and at 12:00 am every   day/night and i had smoked atleast two bowls every day before finaly going to sleep on the 5th day. 
I like to listen to music while i fall asleep, this paticular night i was playing some liquid sound company as i fell asleep. the dream starts and im in my bed listening to music, it pitch shifts up and down and is stress and anxiety inducing. and it continues until i begin to hear rustling outside my window i have not seen it yet but i somehow know exactly what it is, a large badger sits outside my window digging. everything slowly fades to black. i appear in the choir room at my school. my friend zach sits next to me. he soon moves away from me to another seat on the other side of the room. i move to him and he moves again. this happens several times until i finaly come to him and say “stop moving you fucking goon” he then responds with “yeah im sitting with my REAL friends sorry.”I go and sit down across the room from him upset that one of my bestfriends would say that to me,he stares at me for what feels like an eternity as the words ooga chacka ooga booga Replay faintly all around me. he gets up and walks over to me, the ooga chackas grow louder. as he comes over.(i am taller then zac in real life) zac finally stands up and then walks over and with ever step the oogas chackas grow louder,he grows taller, and i shrink in size. he comes to my chair and im the size of a small child while he is a giant. he then says the words”fuck you, 1v1 me in fortnite” as the word fortnite echoes all around me in the voices of random men and women. everything soon turns black. pink and yellow trails appear in the darkness. they flucuate and correspond to the word “fortnite” being repeated they begin going up and down on each syllabal I black out once more then find myself falling from a skyscraper in new york city.

There were these pair of scales holding one stone each—one black, one white. Black representing evil and white representing good. Beneath the scales was a fire pit. As long as both stones were in place, there was balance in the world. But without one stone, there would be too much of the other and chaos will occur. If the scales tipped and one scale’s bottom touched the fire, then humanity’s fate was sealed. Forever. An evil witch-queen ordered the white stone to be stolen and we were to find the stone and find the temple and return it to the scale to restore order and balance before the scale that held the black stone sinks into the fire. Towards the end of the quest, Garak betrays us but we were successful. Although Wendy was killed in the final battle. We had an option to have her lie in stasis for three days, after which she will resurrect, but she won’t remember anything—and I mean anything. Not her life in Neverland, not her life as a grown woman in London, not even her daughter Moira. She won't even know her name. Oh, and the night before we were to set out, I made love to Tiger Lily in a hot spring—which she initiated because I was too shy and tongue-tied! And then after the quest, I made love to her again in a river, under a waterfall, on the night before we headed back (by then, she was carrying my child).

I dreamt I was in my childhood home, (I was raised by my mother and my grandfather in this home until I was a teenager, but my grandpa continued to live there until a few years prior to his death in 2012) the windows were much larger than they actually are IRL and I remember fearing people could see inside. 

I was walking into the restroom and stopped in the doorway and could see a reflection from inside coming off of the bathroom window. When I looked to see what it was, I seen inside of the bathtub that there was a pair of feet. It was if they had been violently ripped off of the body they belonged to, but they weren't fresh. They had been removed from an already decaying body. 

I turned back to go into the living room of the home and on the ground was a torso. Just a torso. Same as the feet, decaying. The word ""HIDEAWAY"" was carved inside of the body of the torso and it was then that I remember thinking in my dream that the torso and the feet belonged to my grandpa. I was starting to feel distraught and wondering who had done this, then randomly my children appeared in my dream, but they were much younger than they are now. Toddlers. I didn't want them to be around this strange stuff, so I bent down to pick them up and realized that next to my Grandpa's torso, there was a small baby. In my dream I knew it was my baby, but it was dead and had blood all over it. My children were telling me I needed to take it but I couldn't. 

In my dream I remember telling them that it was too late, I couldn't save it and we needed to go.

I'm usually good at determining what my dream meant especially when it comes to decisions or warnings but this time it eludes me so I am asking for help.

DS was at rough looking wood table next to a window and out the window I could see snow covered mountains. Ds was dressed in business casual attire. I don't know what RS was wearing or anything like that because it was like RS was there but not there at the same time? Maybe like RS was looking out of eyes that were not their own? I'm sorry I really don't know how to explain that part. So DS gets RS's attention with a grave look from impossibly dark eyes. Like black forevers in each eye. Now that RS is paying attention, DS writes a note that says 'Do not stay after word'. Then DS places a chicken finger in the shape of a large number 7 on the page next to the message. RS says 'ok, I understand' and I immediately wake up and I can remember everything about this dream and I'm instantly pissed with myself because I have absolutely no idea what any of this means even though I said that I understood.

The bastard pulls a 4ft led pipe and an industrial stapler out from behind his back. His smile was now ear to ear. I switched my footing to an defensive stance and yelled out to him only 10ft away ""Are we doing this?"" to which he laughed and replied ""Haha oh yes"" and swung the led pipe at me. I ducked under the swing and was able to grab the stapler pretty easily, it didn't seem like he really cared about it to begin with. I tried to get close enough to land a staple on his face, but i got hit by another swing, and then another (still standing), and another (now knocked down). I couldn't yell. 

I reached out IRL and grabbed my gf's arm, and that woke both of us up. Please give me some insight.

0.0,7p3ap4,0.0,1.0,"Location: Not sure but it seems to be a dystopian Tokyo or a San Fransisco Chinatown or something. There isn't a steady law it seems and things like gambling, under-age drinking/smoking, drugs, and lots of other stuff are either legal or overseen. The cops only get involved if its something serious and they probably won’t do much even if they did. 
Opening Scene: My awakening position was in a huge modern mansion with lots of guests drinking, smoking, and gambling. I on the other hand was gambling. I went over to a gambling table made for robot fights. There was little robots in a small cage that mangled each other until they lost. I didn't know it until I started doing it but I was tricking people into putting a lot of their money on a bot that I knew would lose to my friend with a robot. My friend kind of looked like an Asian Mila Kunis. In the same respect I’ll call her Mila. So Mila and I would scout the competition and find a robot that looked good but we knew we could beat them. Mila would challenge that player and then I would go up to people watching the fight and place ridiculous bets on a bot that looks like it’s not going to win. So it starts like that I walk through the penthouse and go to a table and bet 200 of whatever currency is being used. We win and the guy starts acting like he's gonna run away with my money. I try to make him spit it out when Mila shows me that she stole it back (in an inconspicuous way) I then tell the dude I’ll take what he can give me but that he owes me and he gives me like 60. I thought that I got away big but then a bunch of girls show up that I know. I try running away and they still catch me and take my money from me. I try to make them give it back and they don't so I tell them it’d be a shame if one the girls they were with got caught because she’s a wanted criminal. They told me, “Yeah, because cops are always doing useful stuff and totally don't just sit around all day.” So I figured I owed them money or something like that. Anyways, I’m all disappointed because they took my money but then I hatch a plan to get my friend who's a cop to get them in trouble or something. I find him and bring him outside the penthouse and tell him to wait here. I ran inside and convinced the leader of the ginger gang to go outside somehow and she agreed and started getting the girls together. My plan was that when they walk through the front doors which had a set of two big metal doors I would set of the alarm that shuts the doors ; locking whoever’s in it inside. Then my cop friend would arrest them. As I’m toward the doors I see a weird agile, ninja-like dude turn into a bird and fly up to a ventilation shaft in between the two doors and then turn into a monkey and vault through the ventilation. Then a man-like creature with no discernable features and skin that looked like oozing oil came into frame. He launched tendrils of sharp darkness at the shapeshifter just after he darted into the shaft and then hurried after him. His black tendrils started to build up around the building and cover it. Thats when all the girls I had called over here started over and asked me whats going on. I told them to get out fast and they all did and thats when the building slowly collapsed under the weight of the black ooze. My cop friend was bewildered and shooting off questions as I was still focused on the building. The monster came out of the building and didn't see us. Thinking the shapeshifter was dead we started running away from the building in fear. Thats when I see him gently hop onto a passing man’s umbrella without the man even reacting and look directly at me with mischievous eyes as they both walked away. We eventually ran into an abandoned subway station where that had been turned into a huge bathroom it almost seemed. There we’re baby stations on the walls and the gates they have at train stations scattered randomly around the room. We explored the place and Mila and my cop friend separated. I felt a mysterious almost dark presence although I wasn't scared. I walked into one room and saw a man and boy with bloody gauze covering all of their faces placed face-down on a baby changing station with their drooping feet touching the ground. It looked like their faces had been cut off. We then walked into the next room and found several menacing robots with the faces of real people sewn onto their heads. We instantly knew what was happening and tried to escape as they grabbed some of us and tried to calm assuage us to lay our back against a changing station. They had saw like contraptions attached to one hand and a pistol of some sort in the other. I was able to escape and ran into my cop friend who asked me loudly, “What are you doing in here?” and I motioned for him to be quiet. He caught on and we both stayed still as a two robots walked in one stayed in front of me and the other walked towards my friend. I somehow knew that they couldn't see and relied on sound because they recorded what you said and repeated it once. They walked towards him and repeated, “What are you doing in here?” I then thought mimic him perfectly right behind the first robot turning them both towards me. My friend then repeated it turning them towards them and we started shouting it over and over again until it seemed we caused them to malfunction and start shooting each other. We then grabbed the guns and ran to our friends shouting, “What are you doing here?” in the same tone while shooting the robots up. The girls were tied to the changing station and we saved them just in time. That was about the last thing I remember.

0.0,7loidt,0.0,1.0,"I've had gory and explicit dreams since a child; one of the first dreams I remember was about murder. I've grown used to these dreams. When I have one, I no longer have a disturbed feeling in my gut like before. I simply wake up and continue the day. However, there is two that still stick out to me.


Just a warning these are long.


The first is about and woman and a monster. This is the story dream, its less violent more creepy. A woman has a curse put onto her where the rule is counting back from 1 am a monster would appear in the streets. 


It had the fleshy pink and yellowish appearance of a human turned inside out, and with its fat melted like wax on it. One eye was distinctly visible, that eye was a light blue color, almost unnaturally blue. It did not run, but shuffled in an inhuman manner, like its leg was wounded. 


The story starts in a very dark Victorian era street, things are blurry and distorted, there's an unnatural yellow light, its illuminating the street from bent and warped lamps.The monster first appears here, the woman gets out of a cart and immediately sees the monster in the street. standing still and motionless, its eye is clearly seen. The street is empty. There's a moment of connection and this woman realizes what she is looking at, and starts to run to her home. She has to run towards the thing and it starts shuffling forward. For some reason she bangs on the door first, allowing the creature to get closer, approaching her porch. She unlocks the door in time and slams it shut, knowing the monster can't get inside unless its invited. The dream shifts and the woman is sitting watching her window, the monster is staring in through it. an hour goes by and it leaves. she's safe for now. 


Time shifts again in the dream, and now the woman has an archaic tomb of sorts, she is reading it for answers. Several things are now revealed. One: the monster is only seen by her, anyone else who sees is not in danger. However, they cannot attack it or destroy it. Even if the monster could be seen by all, no weapons would ever harm it. No matter where you ran, it could find you and even the strength of the military, can not destroy it. Two: The tomb mentions, that one has thirteen days to break the curse, before the monster can appear in midday, this is counting back from 1 am. all that is known is its basically game over once it hits the middle of the day as it can appear whenever, and stay however long it likes. Also the monster only appeared for an hour before leaving. 


We are again inside a dark wood home and the woman is in a circle, the tomb in the middle of this spell circle. She's frantically searching for answers. Another odd time skip has occurred, and this woman is now living in more modern times than the Victorian era. It is possible, by how she is speaking there is another in the room. There's a repeated number four days, and a repeated phrase, I'm running out of time.


Time jumps back again we're shown an earlier point in the dream its nearly sunset, the woman stayed out too late. She's with an friend and in the open streets, some people are around. The friend sees the monster, and the main woman grabs her friend telling them they have to hide. They make it just in time to a house, with white painted boards surrounding its stilts. they find a side entrance to the garage like area and hide; the hour goes by and they are safe again, the creature has dissipated. Its unknown why the friend could see it.


We go back the house one more time, more days have passed time is erratic now, almost irrelevant. There is still no answer. The dream ends with the woman standing in a crowded street, its modern times again, everything it bright. But in a moment set up like a movie scene, the woman's face is visible, (its not my face). She's not wide eyed, but expressionless, almost like someone accepting their fate. The vision cuts to the crowd behind her, she's turning and looking. Everyone's face is blurry except, the creature has appeared again, standing motionless, eerily still, the eye is prominent. Its midday and she has nowhere to run and hide in time. The dream ends...


Second dream is shorter more violent. A man walks into a cell, confronting his friend who suddenly went insane. the cell is filled with knee high water, the man enters wading in the water, his friend sits in the water at chest height. The room is dark, barley any light, the walls blackened and rusted.


His friend is grinning, laughing erratically, he's in a untied and unkempt straight jacket. The stable man says something, its inaudible. The crazy one just cackles, and says, ""thank you for visiting me!"". He's takes his long thumbnail, and rips it across his inner forearm, gashing it wide open. Electricity lights up the water and, the stable mans body explodes open, his entrails hit the roof of the cell. The water becomes red, and the man falls away his organs, now stuck to the roof, pulling away with his body. As he falls, the crazy man is now roaring with laughter, his grin toothy and unnaturally wide. The dream ends here. There is an odd post scene, it contains a shark which seems to spewing up a mass of worm like parasites, they are covered in blood, but I don't know why that's there.


I'm not asking for an psyche evaluation, but rather I'm curious what people's take on these are.

I was in this house. I knew I had dreamt about it before. (I've been experiencing a lot of recurring livid dreams in the past 2 months)
It was a small house, while walls and furniture, with some silver metallic details here and there. 
I knew it was a house and not an apartment because it had multiple flights of stairs. 
(even thou I had dreamt about this place before, it was never something that drawn my attention or was nightmarish in any way shape or form).
In this instance of the dream I was making my way from the lowest level of the house to the top floor, through a staircase that could be pulled out of the ceiling on the kitchen, close to the stove. 
I was talking out loud or thinking about something out loud. (I guess talking to someone, as I had a feeling i wasn't alone, though I couldn't see anyone else during the dream).
Then I remember walking through some chair, and after that one of them feel to the ground and begun grinding on the floor with a metallic noise, following my steps. I didn't stumble on it. It feel and was grinding as if someone was pushing them against the floor. 
At that point i felt panic and ran towards the collapsible stair flights, trying to get away from that thing, pulling the stairs from the ceiling. I remember looking back towards the sound and that's when the paralysis kicked in.                        
As I looked into the ground, my sight split into two, vertically. 
On my right was my actual sight, and on the left was the sight of something observing me. 
My own line of sight, begun rotating upwards, in a sort of 360 and it felt extremely uncomfortable and wrong. It came to a halt after it came back to its original position, although it was different, kinda screwed up and out of focus. 
As that happened Then the other sight, on the left, the one watching ME begun rotating on the opposite direction, downwards, and when it completed that revolution, it got me even more into focus, and my personal line of sight disappeared, with the sight of me expanding completely over""my view"".
When that happened, I also saw some evil grim. I never ever felt such a thing. That smile, that grim of satisfaction make my spine chill out of fear. 
And them my sight blacked out. I knew while all this happened that if I made it to the stair top, I would be safe. I would wake up. 
When I failed an that sight overruled mine, I knew I was waking up, but I couldn't escape. It was all dark. I could hear my mom walking around before going to work, but I couldn't move or see or vocalize.                        
At this point I would have panicked if I was younger, but I still managed to keep some calm and just waited for this thing to let me go. It eventually happened a few minutes later.",top,Weird livid dream (nightmare) that triggered sleep paralyzes.,1.0

I pulled into a hotel to spend the night, which was more like a 1960's style family resort. I parked my bike and saw that both my tires were severely damaged. Not by wear or the road, but through a defect. The treads were seperating from the rest of the tire. I had just bought a new tire, so I was very upset. Plus I could no longer get where I was going. i was trying to figure out what to do next as another traveler was telling me they couldn't let me back on the road like that even if I wanted to. Then I woke up.

After I fell back asleep, I dreamt of being on my bike again. Different scene, it's daytime, I'm heading home, on a commute or something. And for some reason, the motorcycle has pedals, like a bicycle, and the one on the left breaks off, so i'm just pedaling with the right, which is very slow. I realize the handlebars are detached from the bike, but I can still kind of steer and the engine barely moves the bike. I then blink and am much further down the road, moving quickly, and realize I must have fallen asleep while riding.

Basically I had a super weird dream last night, that's like no dream I've ever had before. 
I am a huge fan of the Walking Dead so I find myself having a lot of zombies dreams - not super often but at least occasionally. Last night I found myself having a regular dream. I remember being in a big building that was basically like a mall. Everything was normal at the beginning, I was with two people - one who is an old friend of mine who I don't talk to anymore but I dream about often, and the other I don't remember. We went to a little food place inside this mall and I think we got pretzels. People were all around and we walked around a bit and talked and were having a good time. I'm sure more happened that led up to the next part but I don't remember anything in between. 
Next think I know I'm in the same building/mall, but the lights are off, it's night outside, and there are no people (as if the mall is closed) and I'm with different people now. My mother, father, brother, sister, and one of my cousins. We were in this really big area of the mall (but all doors were closed) and basically it was a big room that connected to another, and then 2 sets of big double doors. One that went to another big open room with a lot of other people (who I understood to be the first people to try and keep the zombies away from my family and I) and then the other doors went into a bathroom that also connected to another room (which I later found was a gym). 
It started when I went to the front doors and locked them and for a while we were basically sitting around (as if it was a game of zombie on cod and we were waiting for the first wave to start). We would wait around, and then we would hear or see the zombies coming (if someone or I had the doors open that had the room full of people - and their room connected the rest of the mall). We would basically start locking all the doors as soon as we knew the zombies were coming. We didn't have any weapons and I'm not sure exactly why we were there or trying to get/do but my sister kept opening the doors to the bathroom and trying to sneak past the zombies, and almost every time I would go with her - and my family would start to follow too but we could never reach it. I would never die in the dream but as soon as zombies saw us and either ran towards us or broke through the doors my entire dark part of the dream would restart. It must have restarted about, at least, 5-8 times and every time it restarted I would advance a little bit farther. 
The last thing I remember before I woke up was that my sister and I got very far, and got past the zombies (and for some reason not that many zombies came the last time). We got to another set of double doors very far in the mall - the farthest we had ever been. We opened the door and it was a planet fitness. Workout machines and treadmills. It was dark but I saw the purple and yellow paint. 
It was so strange. ",top,Weird repeating zombie dream,1.0

I had a dream I was at home in my room, everything was fine but I remember a black house (mansion) on a steep mountain close to the sea. It was night and I could see it from afar. Before I knew it I got a phone call on an older phone and picked it up, it was my brother (or I think it was) talking in Spanish thinking he called my dad. I don't know Spanish too well but from my dream I figured out he was impersonating me and asking how my dad is. Weird thing is..I'm a woman.
My boyfriend was in the room and the phone call ended abruptly because he realized he called the wrong person. I told my boyfriend about it and he looked terrified of me, saying that never happened, and that there was no phone call. He even suggested I may be schizophrenic. 
I woke up in a sweat not knowing if I was still in the dream.

I've tried to look this up, but no information about black houses on mountains...or possible siblings impersonating the dreamer. I don't know my brother well since he's my half brother.",top,"First post, I can't find any information about this dream on the net",1.0

0.0,6nms3q,0.0,1.0,"Hello everyone, 

I need some help translating this because, over this past week I've been having a series of dreams that had an oddly linear timeline. I was wondering if you guys can help me with that. It always involves either me or my boyfriend cheating on each other and him sleeping with my friend. Which she wouldn't do because, he's not really her type and he said she isn't his type either.  I'm still freaked out though because, those two people are very close to me and it would kill me if that were to be happening. 

Night 1 Dream 1: 
This started a week ago where I dreamt of a montage of me and my friend hanging out and having a good time but, as time passed by I got uglier and fatter meanwhile my friend got prettier and thinner.  Then my boyfriend and this friend started flirting with each other. As time went on they got closer together while I freaked out and eventually fell out with my boyfriend. 

 Night 2 Dream 1: Then a moment came in when I came out of the downstairs bedroom of his house. [ She lives downstairs with her now ex?  significant other ] I saw from the crack in the door that these two were heavily flirting with each other. Getting all close and personal and what not. I saw them literally 4 inches away from each other and I freaked out and bust the door open and blurted out. Almost forgot to mention that he was wearing his boxers and she was wearing a sports bra and some spandex shorts. I was just wearing his T shirt and some pajamas. 

""Why are you guys so close to eachother!?"" 

My boyfriend and my friend looked at me in a 'What are you doing here?' type of manner I yelled at them more and more, Until I saw that there were people hanging out downstairs a lot of them were friends of my friend but, one of my ex friends were there too. She introduced me to them as they were sniggering at me, 

""h34vym3t4lf4tc4t this is Brandi."" 

and people were laughing their asses off so I got embarrassed and left. My friend was deliberately making me look bad in front of all these people. I was shocked and depressed in my dream as I was running up the stairs and then I woke up.

Woke up next to my boyfriend and told him about how I had a dream that he was flirting with my friend and probably doing something more. We talked for a bit then he assured me that he wouldn't want to screw her anyways because, her face ""reminds him of people with down syndrome."" I laughed because, I felt relieved about it even though it was really mean. I went back to sleep. 

Night 2 Dream 2: Me and my sister were day drinking together with some local rappers at some outside party and She was drunk flirting with a bunch of them while I was still all awkward because, I don't want to mislead anyone because, I had a boyfriend and I'm generally socially anxious when I'm out with my sister anyways. I just get weird vibes from her. At that moment I felt tempted to cheat on my boyfriend because, he may or may not be cheating on me with my friend from the last dream I had. Eventually I started to resist that temptation in hopes of working out the relationship. I sat next to a rapper and when he started talking to me I woke up.
 
It was that day when I had enough people commenting on my weight gain and the fact that just strength training isn't doing anything big to improve it. Last time I knew I was weighing 168 pounds and I was sick of it. So I went on a diet and started to work out constantly. I did some squat thrusts that day I was proud of myself. 

Night 3 Dream 1: At the time he was staying at a hotel and I still live with my parents but, stay with him the majority of the time. One of those days where I was staying there we went drinking together. We ended up at a tavern where someone who I used to know from high school was drinking at. She was just talking to him and he started to buy her shots. They were both already wasted and I was stuck playing baby sitter for him while I was still slightly tipsy. I asked him if I can have a drink and she handed my 35 dollars and told me to buy some shots. At that point I was pissed. Then it flashed to us walking home from the bar and I was still pissed off. He was talking about how he was buying drinks for his crush and I started to yell at him. We ended up cuddling in a bed and I started to hit him. He laughed but, I was so angry I could have killed him that day. I passed out; I woke up sleeping next to him. 

I asked him if he had a crush on anyone he said, 

""Just on you."" 

I hugged him and kissed him on the cheek. 

Night 4: 
I was at a rock concert with some of my friends. I don't recall the friend that was in my previous dreams being there, I just remember I got really drunk with a couple of band members at a warped tour like festival and at that point I was in a relationship with my boyfriend and I didn't really care about cheating on him. So the band members and I went into a dark room and we had a 3some. When it was starting however I woke up. 

That morning we woke up and I had to go home because, he was leaving for Minneapolis for the weekend. I hung out at his place for a bit, had some coffee and went on my way. 

Night 5: 
We were at a high school reunion where he met one of the Preppy chicks from high school and she was talking to him about another girl from high school. I was sitting across from them. He started talking about this other girl and how beautiful her smile was. I started to get mad again and talking at him about how that was rude, etc. The preppy chick had no sympathy for me so she just started to convince him other wise and even swung under the table while we were arguing. After a little bit she got up and was like 

""I'm back.""  

and I was just shocked at what was going on and mad at the same time and before I knew it I woke up yet again. 

Woke up, went to work etc. Didn't tell him about this one. 

Final night/ last night: 

There was one flash of my friend jumping on him while him and her significant other at the moment were laying on adjacent couches playing with magic cards. I showed up and she reluctantly got up and let me sit on him. He begged, 

""h34v7m3t4lf4tc4t please don't."" 

but, I sat on him anyways and kissed him. Her significant other laughed. Then it flashed black for a second. 

Me and him were in the garage we were arguing but, he seems to be taking a light playful tone to it while I was obviously desperately angry. I started stabbing him with a flat headed screwdriver and it just left some scratches. He laughed at my attempts to stab him and I look at the screw driver and wondered out loud, 

""Why did I try to stab you with a flat head? Isn't there a better weapon."" 

he laughed and tried to hug me and I pulled out a big kitchen knife from behind my back and stabbed him deep in the stomach to the point it was starting to crack a bit on the other side. Suddenly I am in my downstairs bathroom by the sink. I twisted the knife in there as I see the pain on his face look more agonizing. Then I pulled the knife out and a giant burst of blood started to go anywhere. I just thought 

'Shit I probably cut an artery.' 

I tried but, to no avail to put pressure on the wound so that it would stop making a mess. As I got up he started to reach for me but, he died. I looked for some towels in my bathroom in vain but, I couldn't find it there. Eventually I found it somewhere else. I started to run downstairs and freak out at the bloody footprints on the floor. I panicked at the thought of getting caught and being sent to jail. I had an hour to clean up a  mess of blood with bleach and chemicals I may or may not have. As well as having to bury a 200 pound body in my downstairs bathroom. Then I start to think of someone who would help and I never felt so alone in my life. Then I lucidly realize that this was a dream and woke back up in my room. 

So on the 3rd day I was discussing those dreams with him and he said something about having a dream like that a week ago. Here is what it is. 

His Dream: In the beginning of the dream I was no longer in the picture in fact I went to a far away place. He does not know where. In the dream he was fucking my friend apparently he told me it was like, 'throwing a hotdog in a hallway.' as that thought came out her vagina prolapse and the prolapsed part started to stick out like a penis. She told him not to worry because, she had a device that puts it back in. I don't remember what happened next but, near the end I suddenly came back in the picture and he was worried about losing me. 

If you guys got this far I was wondering if you could help me translate this cluster fuck of dreams that I've been having lately. It's really been troubling and it would really be amazing. Thank you.

>I turn on the Xbox, presumably with my brother as he was the only one who plays it, and start flipping through the games. I see an add for Halo 2(which looks like the new one) and begin scrolling through the different things the ad says you can do. One is edit a mothership from which you can do your actions from. Suddenly, I’m in a Halo-style mothership that is on the ground and is making motions like its rocking about. I know it’s just a videogame so I attempt to glitch out of the ship, which begins rocking around more violently. I start flying around like an editor ball and grab a block from a structure(looks like something charlie would build in forge mode) and begin carrying it over to the hull of the ship in an attempt to glitch out. The ship’s rocking causes me to be expelled for a moment where I see a green landscape akin to the ragnarok map. I am somewhat surprised that its not in a space map but it reassures me my hypothesis is right. I launch the cube out of the ship and begin flying like when somebody hits  you with a grid. This is where the halo part ends. I am suddenly on the ground, on my face with rolling hills around me. It’s a beautiful landscape and the ship, an unrendered black blob next to me, seems childish. A few marines begin fighting an unknown force above the hill(the marines are also very unrendered and look like bad CGI). I decide to leave the marines(whose bullets seem to do nothing to me) and go over the hill. There I meet a massive black creature, a hummingbird. The hummingbird looks something like [this](http://fantastic-plastic.com/MilanoArt.jpg) (I have never seen guardians of the galaxy), but with opposable wings, being all black, and having a mechanical head with a long proboscis that looks like a needle. It is about the size of three vespas lined up next to each other. I begin to bond with it, but several gaunt, tattered people(but not too tattered) are there and I approach them with the bird. They seem to have the idea of stealing something from a large house that is 20 feet away. I am suddenly in the bushes and it is nighttime, but I feel if I have walked there. They are all waiting for something, and I decide to go inside. I get a few disapproving looks, but they eventually follow. Suddenly, we come across a large, cartoonish light brown cockroach the size of a house rat. I walk out and decide to get on the hummingbird to escape. They try and persuade me to use different transportation because the hummingbird isn’t big enough to comfortably support me. I climb on anyway, and the humming bird nuzzles and licks me with its long metal proboscis. Soon we’re off, flying, but it's not very exhilarating as I have either done it before or am focused on something I have to do. We are flying pretty low above the sidewalk of a suburban street(still nighttime). Then, for some reason, I decide to stop over at a house. A pair of strange crutches that are almost stilts(long crutches, but they have platforms you can put your feet on) are leaning on the house I have stopped over at. A voice in my head tells me they were used in world war 1 but never got that popular. I put on the crutch-stilts(which are hard to use) and begin a rapidly fast walk with them back. I then see the hummingbird flying beside me. I also see many people setting up with lawn chairs and various things to watch an event(still nighttime may I remind you). I tell the hummingbird to wait there and walk a little more to see race cars(strange looking ones) in the distance coming closer. The hummingbird flies in and begins to race with them. I go up to the race manager, a skinny, tall, balding man with sunglasses (still nighttime). I tell him that shouldn’t the humming bird not compete because it has jets. Even though this is being mean to the hummingbird, I feel I am doing it so the hummingbird won’t get hurt. The race manager thinks and yells something over the noise to his friends, who begin taking the hummingbird out of the race. I see the hummingbird rounding one corner and various racers rounding another, on a course to collide. The hummingbird is staying on the sidewalk, however. A massive motorcycle with a large metal lion’s head atop it turns the corner I’m on and blows a white hot jet out at me. I say never-mind to the instructor as the other players have jets to, but he can’t hear me over the noise. Then I wake up softly and without trouble, having slept for a good amount of time.

First dream. I dreamt that she would be transferring to another school from ours, that she said it at the end of this school year in front of the class. It was a stormy day; the rain outside fell like the walls of Jericho, and the wind blew angry like the wrath of a scorned woman. Well, I didn’t quite think about it much, but I felt cold after that. Like, literally shivering. Probably due to the cold weather. I walked home, still shivering despite having worn a jacket, and drenched despite having an umbrella. Next day I came to school. Learned that she already left in a moment’s notice. I looked at the desk where she used to sit; I sat there and I cried. I cried silently, but it was obvious that I was crying because of my posture and the fact that I was just sobbing.

Second dream. I dreamt that I was somewhere in her new school, in her classroom observing the class as it happened. Nobody ever noticed I was there. I saw how her uniform in the new school looked like. I saw her actively engaged in class, raising her hand to the first question asked by the teacher. Again, it was a stormy day; however the rain fell not as hard and fast and the wind never blew as angry as in the first dream.

Third dream. I dreamt that I was in a park with my classmates. The storm was reduced to a drizzle and a light, albeit chilly, wind, but puddles of water were present here and there. While my friends were happy, I was relatively gloomy: smiling, but not as much. I was listening to “Girl with Golden Eyes” by Sixx:Am; at the part where a singer was chronicling their first 10 days of freedom from heroin, a few tears emerged from my eyes, drenching it thoroughly.

|| The Dream ||

So, basically it started off with me 'waking' up in the bed I went to sleep in and at this point in my life I was living in my nans house with my nan - my 'bampi' (grandad) had passed away few years before - So I 'wake' up and start to walk slowly down stairs and enter the living room, which was open plan, so also the dining room.. and we had french doors that looked out onto an ascending garden with a garden path. As i entered the room, on the right side was the sofa and my 'bampis chair' (my nan kept all the furniture so nothing changed after he passed and that was HIS chair he sat in always) and there he was... sat in his chair with his head down facing his lap.. I kept trying to talk to him feeling confused but happy to see him? But he just ignored me and didnt move a muscle.. then for some reason I turned my attention to looking through the french glass doors and onto the garden path and I could see a little girl stood there (about 2years old) I thought, where on earth has she came from and who is she? I opened the doors and onto the garden path and as I got closer to her...

I realised... it was me. As a child. 

(Based on pics I had seen of myself that age) So, I picked myself up and stared at myself and walked back into the house and thats all I can remember!

0.0,5xtjtv,1.0,1.0,"I was in the same house as I am in now, except that the house was somewhat mirrored: the driveway was on the other side, and the side door was where the spare room is. The front and back doors, however, remained the same. I was in the living room with my parents, but none of my housemates were home. We were sitting on the floor with a baby bunny that was sitting in a cage chewing on its bars. I remember telling my parents that the bunny couldn’t stay in there because it’d chew its way out, and that’s not good for the bunny. My parents were over, I think, because of the recent kidnappings going around my area – people, mostly women, of similar age to myself, were going missing from their own homes, by a suspected red ambulance. I remember them getting annoyed at me and kept insisting I take the bunny outside, because it was rumoured that the kidnapper was more likely to take you if you had an indoor animal, because they took the animal as well. But for some reason I had a strong, protective instinct over this animal and absolutely refused. It was around about this time that we saw a red ambulance crawl past the house. I remember us all freezing in fear, and then I had this overwhelming urge to get to the bunny and protect it, so I start to crawl towards the bunny. My parents are whisper-screaming at me to stay still, since it was rumoured that the kidnapper could sense movement. The red ambulance moved on, and we sighed in relief, a sigh that was premature since, seconds later, it started reversing so that it was in front of my house again. It then proceeded to drive into my driveway, and I knew it was coming for me. My parents get up and scream at me to run, to escape out through the side or back doors. I got up and ran, but as I was I realised that the back door was logically the first door they would come through, so I aimed for the side door. It was around about this time that not-dream me realised that the side door was gone, but dream me hadn’t, and was still running towards it. Not-dream me got this overwhelming feeling of dread and fear and inevitability. Dream me kept running until I reached the doorway to the spare room, which at this point was actually where my bedroom is, and I pause, because I can see the rumpus room door, the back door, wide open. I froze in fear, as I couldn’t see anyone, and wondered if I could still make it out the side door. I began to take a step, and then stopped, knowing without a doubt that he was standing behind me. I heard him chuckle as he knew I had realised, and said something along the lines of “turn around, you can’t run from me”. I did turn around, and what I saw wasn’t human. He was massive, shirtless, with too much muscles bulging out, hands hanging at his sides, and three-quarter dark pants, tattered on the ends, and no shoes. His long dark hair hung limp on his head, clearly unwashed and oily. But it was his face that scared me. His face, while still human-ish, was clearly not human. He had lumps and bumps on his face no human has, and his overall demeanour was purely menacing and sadistic. He gave off this aura of fear, and every instinct in me was telling me to run, that I couldn’t fight this guy, to do anything to stop him from taking me. Now, normally at this point in a dream, I have already unconsciously recognised the path towards a nightmare and altered it so that I can fight, or wake up enough so that I can change it. Whilst I did make myself conscious enough to try and alter it, nothing worked. I even tried opening my eyes, but he followed me into reality, and by this point I was absolutely terrified. I grabbed the dream bag** that my housemate had recently made me just days before, held it in my hand, and with my eyes closed once more, I saw a bright light surround him, and he looks up, acknowledging it. He gives me a look, says “I may not be able to get you this time, but I will come back for you”, looks back up, and faded away. 
I remember every detail of this dream, and it was one of the most terrifying dreams I’d had in a long time.

** my housemate and I are very spiritual, and they recently made me a little bag filled with herbs that aid sleep and help ward of negative dreams.

I remember it started off with me doing some menial work at an office, buried in study work. Right now i can't remember what it was, but i know i easily got lost in the work. It could just be a mindless occupation.

Then some time skipped, probably after I left my job for the day as the sun was setting. I came across this random store by my job that i had never seen before. I walk inside and lo and behold, I see a group of my ""closest"" friends inside, and they are the owners. But I also saw another friend (from a different circle, but also very ""close"" at one time) who I've been hurt by so much, i associate him with betrayal. 

In fact, betrayed perfectly describes how i felt because I had always talked about doing business with the group of close friends. I looked around and they even implemented the structure we talked about, it was bewildering. To sort of save face, i barely squeezed out that im ""happy the got the store together,"" when one of them said, ""yeah we really love it here, we're a family."" that crushed my spirit and I retorted ""yeah well i guess im not apart of that family"" with tears welling up before quietly walking out.

After that, i remember thinking that i may have left my wallet back at work. I didn't even check my pockets, just assumed that i left it, and started walking up the block and around the corner to my job. 

When I got into the building, i saw someone, who i had betrayed in my past, riding on a tricycle behind me. (I usually associate this person with fear subconsciously because I cannot seem to ever imagine combatting him, even in my dreams.) he laughs and says a few menial things while I'm looking in the hallways for my office. 

Then I realize I was searching in the incorrect building and tried heading out to get there. This guy then says no you're going this way, pointing me to a room that I'm sure he wants to torture me in. He grabs my hand as I walk away, and i twist myself free, walking quickly towards the exit in the lobby. Thats when the security guards of the building block me from leaving, pointing guns at me and telling me to do as this man says. 

I'm like fuck this and I just wake myself up. Of course THAT'S when i start coming up with ways to fight this man in my own damn dreams. 

Why do I keep giving this person more power? I think it's because of the guilt I have for doing him wrong. Is there a way to heal from that trauma and let it go? That was definitely almost eight years ago. Also whats the significance of the store with my friends? Or even the menial job? If some can help me out, I would very much appreciate it!

In the dream, there wasn’t a room or anything. It was just a black void but I was sitting down playing with a dollhouse, behind me was my desk that had a hutch that held all my books and play dough sculptures. This was all seen from a different angle like I was watching a movie. 

My little brother came up to me and asked me a question. I didn’t hear what he said and I asked him to repeat himself. I don’t know why but I tried handing him a bag of marbles. The bag ripped and the marbles fell everywhere, my brother started crying and ran away. I began to stand up to go after him and ask what was wrong but some unseen force pulled me down and under the desk. 

I woke up after that crying. I begged my mom in the morning to get rid of the desk, she didn’t want to because it was my grandmother’s and she gave it to me when she moved about a week prior. She said she’d put it in her room and we’d switch desks. I didn’t want it in the house at all I screamed and cried until she agreed to take it to the dump. I don’t know why I was so afraid of the desk after that dream but, I couldn’t go near it or even look at it.

0.0,5ncq15,0.0,1.0,"I rarely remember my dreams but when I do they always seem to fall into one of two motifs:

1) Somehow I lose my teeth. This has happened by me biting into a sandwich with rocks in it, getting into a car crash, etc. I am never injured in my dreams anyway aside from spitting out a mouthful of bloody teeth. I think I heard once this had something to do with concern about physical appearance but I wanted to see what other thoughts the community had.

2) The other recurring dream motif I have is harder to explain. I call it the stuck dream. For example, I will be going to my friends house for a party or something and I get in my car and traffic is at a total standstill. I try taking a detour only to find more traffic. I never get to my friend's house. Another one of these I can remember is I am supposed to surprise this girl with a group of friends and I am supposed to make a cake so I go to the store to buy cake mix. I cannot find the cake mix. I spend the entire dream wandering the store trying to find the cake mix but I never do. Last night I had a stuck dream where I needed to get ready to go to dinner with someone but I needed to shave and my razor was old and it was going very slowly. It was taking an astronomical time to shave and again, I wake up before the shaving ever gets completed. In all of these dreams there is a set order of events that I think is supposed to take place before some event and on one of the steps I just get stuck. I wake up with a clear recollection of what the order of events was and what it was to culminate in but on one of the middle steps, I hit a standstill.

I picked up a pebble and took aim. It only went 15 feet into the air and 27 feet ahead, missing the bird by several yards. The crow flew to a maple tree.

The memory of the dream begins when I arrive at the back (or side) door of a HUGE mansion house, and I have this strong, terrifying feeling that I desperately NEED to escape whoever is trying to kill/hurt me. The top of my head is cut, or split open, and bleeding badly. My face is sometimes covered in blood, sometimes just my hands are covered in blood, from holding a wound somewhere else on my body. (When I have the dream and look at my hands and see they are bloody, I wipe them all over my face, because there is nowhere else to wipe the blood, and I don't want to get handprints on the door of the house)
I am trying to find someone to help me get out of this place I am in, in the dream. I think I have come from somewhere in the woods. I yell for anyone who may hear me inside, but there is no reply, so I enter, and lock the door behind me. (I will tell this from the POV where I am covered in blood, and bleeding badly.)
Before I enter, I see a reflection of a face in the window on the door, I know it to be mine, but it doesn't look the same way I usually see myself. I (she?) am covered in blood, and look very scared. My eyes burn because blood keeps dripping in them, and it fogs my vision when it does. 
So I enter the house, and most of the dream is from my POV, running around, locking every door and window, closing all of the white and black curtains, and noticing my bloody footprints on the white carpets, and handprints on the doors and windowsills. 
I realize there are several very nice vehicles parked outside of this huge house. I don't understand why no one is here.
I am desperately searching through every drawer, every cabinet, every basket, anywhere I could find keys. No keys. All 3 above ground floors, I search a bedroom with a large bed, and two side tables, the dresser, I am getting blood everywhere and feeling increasingly guilty for searching and staining this beautiful house, but I am so desperately terrified, I can't just stop to hide.
I realize there is a large garage, semi underground, with multiple vehicles in it, and as I am trying to figure out how to get to it, I hear voices, voices I know not to be afraid of. People who can help me. So I run outside. They are getting out of a dark blue SUV, 3 overweight men, and I run to them, yelling, crying, hysterically begging them to take me with them, save me, please, but they laugh and scoff at me, like I'm a crusty stray cat begging for adoption. They get right back in their SUV, pushing me out of the doorways, and take off. I am instantly much more terrified, and I run inside. I wake up just after I lock the door behind me, and have a sinking feeling that I will never get out of wherever I am, and away from whatever I am trying to escape.

It started where I had woke up in my room... everything was normal. So normal that I actually thought I had woken up. When I went to step out of my room... my door led into a long dark hallway, periodically with two candles beside a door, mostly on the left, but a few on the right. And a mirror directly after each one, right next to the door. The first door had candles with purple flames, and the door itself was heavily damaged, and locked. When I walked past the mirror, I noted that I looked like I did back in highschool, complete with my weatherproof brand coat. Each door after was locked, and the mirrors always showed me a little older. Eventually I came to one on the right, and when I reached for the handle, the door became bloody and the flames lashed out at me, which at that moment I had felt a pain in my chest of an indescribable magnitude. But when I looked in the mirror, I seemed healthier, happier. Then came the end of the hall, and there were two eyes peering at me from the doorway, and something spoke, but I couldn't hear it, then I tried to run.. but the ground opened up, and swallowed me. I fell headfirst for what seemed like an eternity... all I could hear  was the words that could only be described as self doubt. My descent began to slow.. and I turned over, landing gently on my feet. Surrounded by an infinite expanse of darkness, I would speak, and my voice would echo forever.. and I felt as though I should have been afraid. But I wasn't. Something felt like I wasn't alone.. but it wasn't a bad thing. So I ran... and kept running until I fell again, and soon I found myself on a gently lit, but massive chamber, with a sphere in the middle. As I, what I would hae called flying, flew up to it. It seemed to turn, and I would assume faced me. When I touched it, it began to open, bathing everything in a bright light... and then I woke up.




Edit: I figured this one out on my own. The doors represent the paths of my life that lead me nowhere, the falling through the floor represents that my current path has led me nowhere, and I needed to change paths. The infinite void is an undiscovered world if possibilities, and being compelled to run in a direction without fear, is choosing a direction in life. Falling into the empty chamber is a transition of meaning, where the shell around my own heart resides, untouched by anything. Me touching the shell causes it to open, representing loving oneself, and the light is what someone else needs to get past. ",top,"So, this one escapes me.",1.0

Last night I dreamt that she was alive and that she had two kids (a boy and a girl) and she and the kids came to stay with me and my wife and our kids. We set up a room for her and the kids and her sister (who was also a co-worker for many years) came over with her little girl and that all the kids were playing together in the room. The dream was a happy dream and there was no sadness involved, like she never passed, there was also no context in the dream as to why she was moving in with us.

He said he just felt he had to.
What does this mean? Can anyone help with an interpretation? I tried googling it but the quality of the info is negligible at best.

Edit: Just some background; She was about 23 when she passed, never had kids and the guy she was engaged to was a real scumbag IMO. They both died in a car crash when he lost control of the car and folded it around a tree. We were told that he wasn't speeding (they where coming home from the pub, I suspect he was drunk out of his skull) But the damage to vehicle proved the opposite. There were rumors that she had broken off the engagement that night and people who where at the pub claimed they saw them arguing.

In my dream, I laid down and fell asleep on the couch at my mom's house and had a dream of an evil witch who looked like something out of a cartoon but I understood that she was demonic. In my dream I saw her in the hallway and she sort of snickered and went into the bathroom, and then I woke up from the dream within the dream. After I woke up, I went to the bathroom and to my dismay, there were large black footprints burnt into the bathroom tile. Fear gripped my heart, and I turned around and went back toward the hallway toward the living room.

This was the worst part. When I look in the living room, all the women on my mom's side of the family (there are 4 of them) were lined up in a row in the middle of the room. They were not only dead, but decaying. Their faces are etched in my memory. They were blue and grey, rotting and skin peeling back. Their eyes looked like they had cataracts in them, grey and filmy, like they couldn't see, and wide open. Their heads were snapped back at an impossible angle, as if there necks were broken, the backs of their heads at a 90 degree angle with their necks, so they were all staring at the ceiling. I looked at them, scared as hell (obviously), and I think I looked at one of them up close although I don't remember who. After i did that, that body lurched forward and I moved out of the way at the last second, sending the body crashing into the coffee table. Then I ran into the kitchen. This whole time it had been storming outside, and I looked out the window at the storm. I suddenly felt as though I was fighting for my soul because I felt it being ripped away, so I prayed hard and I remember watching the storm outside turn to sunshine. It went back and forth a few times, from storm to sunshine, as I struggled with the dark side to keep my soul. Finally, God won and the sunshine returned, my dead family members disappeared, and I felt relieved. When i woke up I got the feeling that this dream was very important, and as I said it felt very real to me.

So, any interpretations? Thoughts? Comments? Leave them down below. Thanks!

In my dream last night, my father somehow got a hold of my phone and went through my contact list, hoping to find volunteers / specimens for his science experiment. He used this information to send three of my best friends and my girlfriend into outer space, where they all died tragically. Angrily, I confronted him about it. I can’t remember what came after the confrontation though.


I have no idea where to start with this dream. What could it mean? My father is no scientist. I think what stands out the most is that he was always an angry person, and to this day I would never be able to confront him in real life.

0.0,48ib9b,0.0,1.0,"Hi all

I always have recurring dreams of other people's houses. These are houses or apartments that I love or have been in recently or all my life. This time, I dreamt of a lover's apartment.

I am a near-lucid dreamer, but this time, I thought as it was as real as I thought it was.

I decided to ring on the doorbell of a lover's apartment. It felt like a whim, and for some reason, I was convinced that it was totally safe to see him, aka I thought his girlfriend was away.

He and I have know each other for almost a year. When we first met he made it known about his ""interest"" in me in spite of already being in a relationship. I have said no until last fall. To say that we had an amazing time is an understatement. The last time we were at his apartment together, he started the evening by saying ""this will be our last night together,"" but as I was about to leave, he changed his mind and said ""I want this to continue."" I was okay with either as I wasn't losing a friend. We'd still see each other but not as his apartment while his partner is away. We hadn't ""continued"" since. I kind of miss him but I know my place.

I was in his neighborhood during the day and I felt a strange confidence to go and ring his doorbell. I remember feeling like I was beside myself until I actually rang the bell.

I opened the door and was about to go up when I saw his face emerge from the top of the stairs. He saw me but didn't look all too happy. It was a mix of annoyance, fear, nervousness, and relief. Then his partner appeared next to him, looking at me, with a look of friendly expectation on her face. Her expression didn't have an opinion of me. Meanwhile, both of them are holding boxes.

She saw me and I was let in. They were moving. As soon as I stepped into their apartment, everything was packed. Shelving they've put up has been dismantled, boxes are tucked against walls.

Soon, other people were coming up, looking at the apartment. I lost track of where the lover went but I woke up with the sense that he was upset with me, if not for showing up, then perhaps for something else. We hadn't seen each other for a month and even then, nothing happened. We were actually at a party and we were well behaved. As soon as I woke up, I felt all that but knew at which point I realized it was a dream.

We were having class in an old cabin in the woods. Surrounding the cabin was a beautiful garden. The air was crisp just as it is now in November.

She was talking about something, then a black praying mantis started crawling up her arm. Two women walked by and notified her that she had something on her arm. She replied ""Yes, I'm getting my thinking on."" Then she reached to stroke her chin thoughtfully. Thats when it attacked her.

The black mantis dove straight into her ear and started destroying the inside of her head. I noticed a few more walking around and decided I needed to run.

The girl followed me since she managed to get rid of the original attacker. We were outside trying to walk through people on what seemed like one of those long, zig-zagging paths that buildings put for those in wheelchairs. We were struggling to get through the people to avoid those terrifying bugs, though they kept landing on us and flying away again.

I'm not sure why the girl was in my dream. I've only talked to her a few times this year through comments on various WWE posts she's made. That's really all.

So any thoughts as to why she may have been in the dream, and what the attacking black mantis might mean?

0.0,3m1c9f,1.0,1.0,"Hi. I'm very new to Reddit so I hope I'm doing this right. 
I am asking for help to interpret a dream I had last night.
Unfortunately, I rarely remember my dreams so when I do remember one, I think about it for days. Last nights dream was very short and clear. In the dream i was packing mine and my ex-partners suitcases, as we were going on a airplane trip (holiday, I think) together. I don't know where we were going but I was packing lots of winter clothes, as if we were going to a very cold place, and I was trying to take as many warm clothes as possible. I was doing the packing (I don't know what he was doing) and we didn't talk much. In the dream we were in a relationship. There weren't any exaggerated emotions or feelings or words. It was just a ""normal"" packing for a trip together. When I woke up this morning, the one thing that stood out from the dream was: the two of us were packing to go on a trip together, like that was the most natural thing to do. That's all.

For those who want to know a little of the relationship history, please read on. My ex and I were in a 2 year relationship, and I still have feelings for him, and I’m sure he still has feelings for me also. The relationship was very loving, open and relaxed. We got on very well and could talk about anything. We lived separately but talked about a future together, however that was going to be hard to achieve because my ex has an unemployed adult son, with a soft drug addiction and social phobia, living with him. The son has nowhere to live, cannot look after himself, and is unemployable, and my ex didn’t know what to do about it. While together we went on 3 overseas trips together and had a very good time. One day, 4 months ago, we had a small disagreement, than silence for a few days. When I texted him asking him to explain what’s going on he said he prefers to be on his own and spend more time with his friends, and doesn’t want to live with anyone, now or in the future. I told him I didn't believe that for a moment but he never gave me a better explanation. We broke up and he has been avoiding me ever since. The break up left me very hurt. I don’t believe he told me the truth why he broke up with me, but I don’t have a better idea. I do know that there isn’t another woman involved.

Does anyone know what this dream means? I'd like to believe that it means that we will get back together and ""travel"" through life together. However, I don't remember the rest of the dream. I never saw us get on the plane so, who knows! Maybe he chickened out (again) and I went on the trip alone. 😉

Thank you.
