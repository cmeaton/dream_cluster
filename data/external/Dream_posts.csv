Then he flipped me off. With a grin too. Kid seemed like a jerk.

0.0,asp5kp,0.0,2.0,"I had a very fucked up dream last night. Me and some friend I know from my childhood were recording music in his studio. Some of his friends were there and also my little brother. We were all drinking and everything was blurry and in a nice soft red light. 
At one point I wanted to get something from the kitchen so I left and stumbled out of the room. I got really horny and started thinking about the friend I know for a long time. Someone was walking into the kitchen. Cause all the light came out of the room I couldnt see who it was but I thought I recognize my friend. So I got on my knees and started sucking his cock. He really liked it and was moaning out of joy. He came pretty soon and after I swallowed his cum I looked up.
And I saw my little brother!!! I was totally confused and disgusted. I guess the dream continued with me trying to hide what I did.

The dream starts with me helping my aunt go onto the elevator leaving me after visiting me. Once I closed the door I walked into my room and I fall asleep. 

I wake up, in my dream, and I walk like I'm hypnotized towards the balcony doors of my apartment and everything is open wide and cold wind blowing.

At the same time I feel very worried and scared while being hypnotized all at once like I'm fighting the hypnosis. I closed the doors and at the same time I know I'm fighting some unknown force that keeps me from closing the windows. But as I close the last one I turn around and my aunt is back but I didn't feel safe with her, I scream and I faint.

I wake up again but I know I'm reliving the same dream! As I ran to the living room everything is closed but my aunt's balcony doors are open this time. Only difference is there is a boy on the balcony and I walk towards him and then as I blink the boy is now a man my age and I hug him tight and I tell him to come in.

After that I wake up again and the dream goes as the other two times but this time everything is closed and no boy or aunt.

But as I'm doing some chores when someone breaks into my house and I'm terrified and someone walks in and shoots me.

Then as I blink the man takes his mask off and it's the guy from the balcony and he smiles cruelly and says;

""Thank you for letting me in.""

I wake up in real life and I checked everything in my apartment and I'm terrified. But I can't shake the feeling that I know the man...

 Strange enough, even though the Crusades is a Christian term...I was also shocked learning that China was leading it for the ""Christian"" side.

Europe was fully Islamized and Jihad was declared for attempt in establishing a one world order caliphate. This caused China and parts of the world to join together and announce a type of ""crusade."" 

USA, India, Russia, Canada were in full civil war/political chaos because enough people within those countries were in support of a caliphate to essentially disrupt their own government's. 

The crusades were not lead by a Christian country.  Instead, in my dream, I was shocked to see that China was leading it.  China assisted the ""crusader allies."" Also in my dream I was trying to see if Isreal was still a country.  I down remember what I saw with that.

The dream started off with my friends and I wandering in a craggy desert maze, where we saw a few random boxes full of things like mining equipment, I don't remember much of the maze. 

Later in the dream we all made it to my house, and started to calm down. Then, we notice someone outside who we somehow knew had DID, she had long black hair and was slouched over. My friend asked, ""How dangerous is this disorder?"" and I said, ""Not at all."" (As I had learned from reading up the previous day.) Suddenly, the girl pulled out a large bloody knife, and ran towards the glass doors, and slammed into them, then pounded on them loudly, and I woke up. 

That terrified me, because usually when I hear a noise like that in a dream, then wake up, it's because I *actually heard it in real life.* I sat there, petrified, staring at the corner of the window, not wanting to move my hand in order to see the rest of the window, as they might see me.

While we were on a break showering, he followed me into my bathroom stall after getting caught staring and smiling at me from another stall (well, he's tall so he made that excuse that he couldn't help catching me checking myself out in the mirror).

I'm writing this at 7:30 in the morning during a depressive episode so hold on tight. I've been having very depressing and anxiety inducing dreams about my boyfriend. It started around Christmas time when my sister and him were having a great time joking around and it's only gotten worse. I have dreams where they're both with me and I go to do something for him only to go back to ask him a question and see them having sex.

I go in there and his pants are down and it's not just them having sex it's him initiating sex like he does with me.

I recently visited New York for the first time.

&#x200B;

My second night in New York I had a dream about a  dead actor (he died before the 60's) out of the blue.

He met me in Times Square, snow was falling, we were the only two around.

He walked up to me, said ""Hi"", smiled, I said Hi and we walked side by side smiling in silence then I woke up.

&#x200B;

The next day I recalled the dream vividly and emotionally. It felt very real.

&#x200B;

I went on with my day, got on the subway and visited Central Park.

&#x200B;

At one point I crossed the street and sat on a random stoop of an old Brownstone building, to look up the nearest coffeeshop directions on my phone to walk to.

&#x200B;

Just then - this actor appeared in my mind again.....it just kind of HIT my thoughts  like a bird on a windshield and I thought, ""What is going on?? Why am I thinking of this actor so much?""

&#x200B;

I got distracted then and instead of looking for a coffeeshop anymore, I typed his name into google.....

I vaguely recalled he used to hang out / live in New York, though he mainly lived in Los Angeles.

&#x200B;

I found an article about an apartment he had in New York, that he went to when he wanted to escape Hollywood, etc.

The address was in the article as fans go and visit it regularly.

The whole thing is still too odd for me, and this is the first time I’m posting on Reddit. I still don’t know what I’m doing here yet I’m typing. 
Here is the thing: one of my best friends messaged me this morning saying that she dreamed of me on the first day of our lunar new year, where I was with my new man etc.. I didn’t pay too much attention at the beginning as I thought she probably misses me too much cuz we don’t live in the same country and we haven’t been in touch for a while. So she went on giving me the full lens of the dream she had last night. At some point I stopped her and asked how did my hair look like, then came the WEIRDEST PART: she said I had bangs in her dream. I didn’t change my hairstyle for almost a decade, last time I had bang was 9 yrs ago graduating from high school. But last month, in the spirit of changing for a better year I cut my long hair and went back to bangs. There’s no way she could have known that, spooky as it is, so now we are talking.
The thought immediately hit me: I want to try and find “my man” in her dream.
I’ve been single for about 3 yrs getting out of a long long term relationship, and I’ve been living in different countries since. I love where I am at my life and I’ve said once too many times that “ I don’t believe in relationships” and I still don’t. But I can’t focus myself on other things right now after her story, all I’m thinking about is that I need to find that man!
So I came to Reddit thinking I’d give it a try.
In her dreamed, she bumped into me on the street of Beijing where she lives in in real life. And I was with a guy whom I called “my man”, and who appeared to be an “Asian-looking English speaker”. He had a friend called “Josen”( a name I’ve never heard of in my entire life). Apparently I followed “my man” to Beijing China, where he worked for a shop where I wished to get a job too to help him out running errands or doing administration. It was either a restaurant or a clothes shop. He didn’t speak in the dream, so we couldn’t know what language it was or what kind of accent he had( yet she was so sure somehow he was an English speaker). He was wearing a purple hoodie and earring(s). She told me she could still recognize him if given a photo, then she sent me a picture she found online of someone who looks like him for reference. (a guy called YU ZHANG starring in a film called WU MING ZHI BEI so it says on IMDb) the photo should be in link if I managed to attach it
So, do you have a friend called Josen?
Do/could you own a purple hoodie? 
Do you have ear piercing(s)?
Do you work in/plan to work/see you yourself in future to work in a restaurant/bar/clothes shop in Beijing? 
If I had decided to leave all my life in Europe, and above all had given up my belief that I don’t believe in relationships to follow you to Beijing where I can’t stand the air nor the traffic, if you do exsist, I think we should say hi.

Me and my boyfriend had just moved into a house. A lovely house that had unknown origins. Probably in the 1800s due to the way it looked. There was enough room for us, our cats and to build our family. The previous owners had however told us of a room hidden in the house. That in no circumstance should we open those doors. We thought it was just a joke. We should have listened to them. Inside another room we tought was a closet, actually had a hallway that continued into a bigger room. There was another small room containing a washer and a dryer as well as a kitchen area in the bigger room. There was a lot of stuff laying around, as if the precious owners had left without packing up their stuff. Strangely, there was also nail marks everywhere. On the walls, on the floors, etc. And then there was these french doors. Beautiful french doors made of a beautiful red wood. One of them was slightly open. That was when we decided to bring my parents in to explore further. We opened the doors and noticed it went deeper than we thought. I remembered the precious owners telling us that the house used to belong to a steel factory owner and that the house used to be connected to his factory in order for him to easily go and inquire about his employee's work. The factory had been shut down in the 1950s for unknown reasons.

When we arrived at the bottom, flashlight in hands, we realized something. We were actually in the old abandonned factory. It was weird though because it was full of toys, items, clothes and nail scratches. All over the floor, stairs, etc. We decided to come back up and call the police instead. When we got out of the closet, however, something happened. Screams. There were screams getting louder and louder. It sounded as if someone or something was coming up the stairs. Then it came closer. And then it was banging on the closet door and screaming something inhuman. 

We all got out of the house and called the police. The police came, went downstairs but found nothing. All the scratches were gone. No one was found. They deemed the room was unsafe for habitation and told us to concealed it. We stopped hearing the entity so we moved in.

Years later, after having a child and settling in, we had forgotten about the closet. My now husband had to leave for work and i was alone in the house. For some reason, i started to clean the house. Having forgotten about the closet, i thought i could use it as storage. I opened the door and then remembered. I closed the door but it was too late. I could hear it again. The screms getting louder and louder. And then the banging. I took my daughter and the cats and we went to my parents house, which was mext door. It was do loud we could hear it through their walls. Their house was not even connected to ours. The next morning, we hired people to pack our stuff and left. We payed for the house to be demolished and for high metal fences to be build on the property. 

And then i woke up. And i huged my boyfriend, looked at my daughter and felt relieved. I have never seen this house in my entire life but i will remember to check the closet for french doors.

Our fence gate was open and I was running back and forth between dumpster and trash. The space, you could see the dumpsters lined up behind the houses.  In this space I could see red soldiers in uniforms at farthest house down going inside the house from the back. I was confused and told my mom whom was cleaning with me. 

She had this frightened face and told everyone to hurry up and finish. So my siblings were running to complete their tasks. I was just standing between our gate in a daze, a figure was passing by the gate. It was a old man with a gun saying “they are coming, those soldiers”.  I was shocked because when he left my eyesight I could hear gunshots. I immediately closed the gates and was running back to the backdoor but then I heard some cries from the gate. It was a family of three begging to come inside and we let them in. 

The soldiers were one house alway and I shut the gate. (But it was the hardest thing I could, I was so scared) I ran to the backdoor and the others were entering our garage door. (It leads to our basement) And apparently nobody had told my brother and sister-in-law with my niece of the red soldiers. Filled with distress and fear I opened the door and woke up.  But I didn’t wake up, it was a dream in a dream, in this dream I went on social media (I was on my bed) and saw that other people had dreams about the red soldiers.  It was on the news too because of how wide spread it was. I was told by someone, dunno who, to submit my dream to social media. (In search for others) 

But at that moment is when I woke up and felt the fear to tell everyone in my house.

This was one ship of many and my particular ship held people from the hospitals. So the sick, wounded and pregnant women. I was a nurse assigned to assist midwives in birthing all these babies when necessary. 

Long story short we didnt beat the storm. It fell upon us and caused some ships to collide with one another, mine included. We started taking on water and I had to think fast. There were too many patients on board and choices had to be made... I decided that the newborns were my top priority. I collect a safety raft and gather what infants can fit. I had 12 screaming babies and they all fit in my raft so long as I was outside of it. 

So I'm swimming through the waves fighting hard to keep it steady. I start to lose babies. Left and right. I save one. Another falls out. A guy from another boat saw us and helped me save as many as we could but... in the end we couldnt save them all and it was heartbreaking.",hot,Sinking Ships,1.0

Not chainsaw massacre style but kind of psychologically. He eventually delivers a blow that is fatal but doesn’t kill us right away. My partner asked me to kill her with a gun but I missed and didn’t deliver a fatal blow. So we suffered and died together. I woke up. Or so I thought.

0.0,ah1onl,0.0,1.0,"So I had this dream that conjoined in with a couple other ones at first. Like I either started a new college program or moved houses or something. I think it was moving houses. I moved into a flat beneath my mom’s flat, so it was a huge house with several flats rented out and I would go over to her house every so often. It was basically like living with her-which I don’t in real life. 

I think I was in the army? Or the cia? Something like a secret service. And I had this guy posing to be my bf that was giving me orders. 
Anyway, so one day my mom is having a party or something at her house and I’m there. We get into a fight or something and I decide to run away, or move. I pack my bags and hit the road. 

One of the bags is an old green one I take everywhere irl and it’s on my back. I have only my necessities. I’m walking by several dreamscapes I dream about often. There’s this big beach one I’ve dreamt before, where it’s a town overlooking the water. It’s night time and no one is outside. All of a sudden I’m swimming in the ocean. I get mildly confused and scared by that but choose not to be fully lucid. So I get this message in my earpiece that the cia or whatever installed, they tell me I’m swimming because I’m supposed to be taking an item in my bag to an abandoned ship/plane to dismantle some kind of explosive underwater. I start receiving information about how the plane crashed and see it play out in front of me quickly. It was some kind of battle that happened and we lost. 

So I’m swimming, trying to hold this shit on my back. When I feel a little tug. I turn around, nothing’s there. I get scared and remember all the scary stuff in an ocean.. specifically an ocean in a dream nightscape.. I swim faster and hurriedly approach the submerged plane. There’s blue lights bouncing off of it and illuminating certain parts. I look down from the surface of the water and just feel terror and disgust at the submerged plane and tiptoe-swim by the propeller, scared at “what if it turns on?” Type thoughts. 

I get stuck on the underwater plane for a half second and something rips my bag off from behind me. I look up and it looks like something is falling from the sky, but the thing is black and I only have the golden light from the city to bounce off the thing to see it. The thing crashes into the water a few meters in front of me. I’m frozen with fear and then swim as fast as I can to the shore (which I’m very close to). I get out, shaking, soaked, no bags attached to me. I look over the water and see several huge orca whales swimming around all over the water I was just in. A voice from behind me comments on them, like “aren’t they beautiful?”
I’m like yeah I guess, and watch them for a minute. I feel fascinated by the orcas but also terrified that I was in with them. I turn around to the voice, no ones there. I kept walking, figuring out what to do about the bags I just lost in the sea. I’m so disappointed in myself I’m mad. How am I gonna get back home? How am I gonna get the bags back? 

I sit on an empty bus stop and think. There’s more and more people walking around and the sun is coming up. A man approaches me with the same voice as before, he kinda looks like a hairier younger version of bill burr. He smiles and asks if I need help. I’m wary of him so I decline. Just then a girl runs up to him claiming she’s lost in her dream and needs help. People also saying they’re dreaming in my dreams isn’t uncommon for me, so I just watch. She runs up to him and he offers for her to use his phone. While she sobs and calls someone, he just looks at me and smiles. I figure what the hell im dreaming anyways and ask to use his phone.

All of a sudden I’m back in my room in my flat. There’s one bag on my bed, not the important one I lost. So I’m back being upset I didn’t do the mission. I find my mom and tell her what happened, she’s not really listening but mindlessly is like “well where’s the bag? Cant you go back?” I’m like “woman I was in the middle of the ocean!”
I go back to my room and sit and cry and think about what to do. Do I go back? I could pinpoint where the bag was that I lost, like some kind of sonar satellite vision. It was right where I got attacked. The things in the bag were spread out a little though, so it’d be a most intense underwater experience trying to get that shit back. I was stuck between giving up or trying again. Feeling like shit. Then something told me to look through the bags on my bed. I did and there were so many clothes, but under them was the thing I lost! Someone must have got it for me. I was a little relived and then I woke up. 

I feel like it’s a pretty to-the-point dream (for me) but I can’t figure it out. I should note that Usually when I dream about swimming, I am often scared and looking down for sharks and other creepy things. ",hot,Swimming with orca whales on a mission to find a plane crash.,1.0

To set the scene a little, it was when the immigration debate over child refugees was really starting to happen a lot, when there were increased incidents of police brutality in the Phoenix area, and when a lot of crazy shit was happening! I want to say this was sometime in July, 2014.

In the dream, it was daytime - late morning or early afternoon, and the city of Phoenix and the whole area was a barren post-apocalpytic wasteland with no sign of life anywhere. The only living thing visible was a stray, raggedy looking, black and white dog who was friendly who appeared later.

All the highways were long gone; only a few of the original buildings remained standing, only they were in ruins. The sense was that this was late in the 21st Century, felt like 2094 or 2097, where a giant sandstorm, or whole series of them, had literally buried much of the city long ago. I had the sense that there had been widespread violence at some point in time, whether it had been the result of a major large-scale war, or massive civil unrest! Although, it is also possible that the city was simply abandoned, as I didn't notice any bullet holes on buildings one would expect to encounter in a warzone. Although, the sense was that a Second Mexican-American War, in at least some capacity, had taken place a considerable time before then.

I recognized this one apartment building in particular that had been standing in 2014, where I was able to make it up to a higher story, and into an apartment, out of the wind, where it looked like it still had some things inside from whenever anyone had lived there sometime in the past; it had long since been abandoned. It was when I came across a friendly, raggedy looking dog who was coming around the corner in the room when I woke up; feeling like ""I'd seen the future,"" or a possible future, in a sense.

It was remarkably vivid. Felt a lot like Will Smith's ""I Am Legend"" experience, only it was in Phoenix, and there weren't any zombies around.",hot,"Dream-Premonition where 2094-2097 Phoenix, Arizona was a barren apocalyptic wasteland in ruins in the future",3.0

Ive been having a recurring dream for around 3 years now. For some background my mother passed when I was 19 (now 24) after being ill most of my life. We had an okay relationship closer to the end because I took care of her the last 2 years of her life, but definitely weren't close before that. 

The dream always starts out with me showing someone a house. Sometimes its a housewarming party and the house is packed while I show my best friend around. In these its always well lit and the house is decorated to my style and I feel happy, a bit stressed. Like I would if holding an actual party. Other times its just me and a stranger, these instances the house is almost bare of furniture with the lighting of an early winter morning. I always feel heavy with sadness in that version, like the deep throws of depression. I don't want to show the stranger my house, and he doesn't seem to care to see it. 

They always end the same way, though. After I show the whole house I lead the other/s to a bedroom (mine?). I stand at the end of the bed, facing the doorway we walked through. Thats where I see my dead mother standing half behind the door. Shes dressed in sweatpants and a plain white shirt with small frills around the neck (her pyjamas, and main outfit the last few years of her life) she looks grey and sickly, but not rotting. And she's holding huge vintage metal scissors. She starts cutting her clothes off with the scissors very slowly, staring at me the whole time. I can't look away, at this point either my friends husband (in the party scenario) tells me he sees her too, I just need to look away and it will stop. But I can't look away.  The stranger usually stays quiet, but the few times he has spoken, that's the point where he tells me everything's okay. 
Once she gets all of her clothes off she starts to slip the scissors under the skin on her wrist and cut through it (and it really is a slip, it doesn't seem to take any effort). Ill spare the details here, but she essentially cuts through pieces then peels it off in strips. Sometimes I wake up with the first cut to her wrist, other times its all but her head. 
Usually I can't wake up until I scream at her to stop it.

&#x200B;

The moment that I got conscious of my dream I saw my body standing in front of the hutch for our rabbits, my spirit was floating approximately 15 meters above my body.  At first I was completely paralyzed and I could only stare down, I saw myself opening the hutch and my body took my favorite rabbit out and held it like a baby. While watching from above, the paralyzation slowly wore off till I was able to move again. I floated down to my body, while getting closer I heard my body whispering to the rabbit in a language that I did not know nor sounded like a language that I have ever heard before (e.g. Italian, Chinese, Arabic, et cetera). While whispering the rabbit started to look like it became possessed, at a certain point my body stopped whispering and the rabbit looked up in a very unnatural way, his head stood exactly in 90 degrees upwards facing me, it was more or less an L-form. Thereafter my body put the rabbit back in its hutch and my body picked up the next rabbit, planning to do the same. Then I thought really hard: ""NO!"" (As in I am not going to curse another rabbit). Then I blinked with my eyes, I was again up 15 meters above the ground but my body was gone, then I felt drawn back to my body and I woke up laying in my bed.

&#x200B;

The next morning when I stood up, my mother told me that there was something wrong with one of the rabbits. I walked up to the hutch and I saw the rabbit laying in the same L-form, his eyes spinning and it looked possessed just as in my dream. We took the rabbit to the veterinarian and there was no other option than euthanization. The vet said that this can be caused by a parasite which seems like the best possible cause for the illness of my rabbit but still it felt weird due to that a healthy rabbit went in one night to really ill while I dreamed about it.

I was first caught in a girl's dream thread and I was inside her dream. I knew it was a dream because I am a man. She was getting rejected by her family for trying to become an actress. 

Next I was thrown out of her dream and pulled into another of a guy and he was fishing. He sat for a bit and after a while he caught a fish and was reeling it in with a far amount of vigor. I could feel he was very excited. Again I knew it was not me, because I do not like to fish. Some how I was looking at him, while being him.

Third a was pulled into the guy who was the boyfriend of the first girl and she was going to do a low grade sex scene with some other guy. He was not happy about this. His feelings were hurt and he left the set and saw two boys. One was trying to find his missing leg. He had a replacement that looked very real. His brother said he looked for his real leg everyday, but could not find it. The brother was soldering a metal tower statue together. Strange because we were outside. At this point I began to become one with the guy I was in and give the kid some tips. Also for what ever reason I was on a moped and I was trying to fix it. I was adjusting the height of the handle bars. Then the girl from the sex scene...our girl shows up and I wake up.

It was so exciting until this random girl appeared and she was weirdly very happy. I had no idea who she was but she claimed she had sold her soul for her position as the main character on my film. She spoke of how successful it would be, but despite this ‘good’ news, I felt very very uncomfortable around her. Her darkness was intense. 

(I don’t know how to explain this, but I guess in my dreams I just -flash- into new scenes with little explanation... but they make sense when I’m dreaming)

I think I’m trying to avoid that strange girl... and even though I’m far from her, the things she had said about selling her soul to the devil are spinning around loudly in my head... I’m riding this carriage with 3 horses, and I’m going as fast as possible but I’m struggling to control my horses, as they are all trying to run in different directions (left, forwards, right) and then a great storm erupts. Like a whirlpool. And the earth beneath us melts into a huge lake. It becomes even harder for me to control my horses, and suddenly all of their eyes fall out- but I somehow catch them? And store the eyes in my mouth to keep them moist... gross and weird idk but i have nowhere else to put them- and my hands are busy tightly holding the horses’ reins. 

I eventually find cover inside a small house, an old woman quickly gives me a cup and I spit the eye balls into it. But I’ve accidentally chewed on a few of them. I grow frustrated because the eyes that are ruined won’t be any use to the horses. Everything seems so rushed. Only one horse has a proper unscratched pair of eyes. The other 2 remain blind. I have to set them all free now.

The storm gets worse. There are barely any dry parts of land. Random people hurrying through the lake get zapped by what it appears to be lightning bolts. It seems as though, no where is safe. I try to help guide a small group of people through the storm. The water is about waist deep. It’s hard to move quickly. I lead my group into a cave and we hide there for a while until the storm clears up. When it is over we crawl out of the cave and the sky is blindingly bright. 

Then I wake up...

In some dreams, they appear in my house and I have ways to kill them but they keep coming in hordes and I can’t manage them all. In others, it’s one particular bug that, well, bugs me.

0.0,a9pg16,8.0,5.0,"I’ve looked at old post on this topic. Most concluded that the reason you can’t punch hard in dreams has something to do with body movement and brain activity. Something about the brain missing certain cues, causing movement to seem sluggish or weak. 

At first this made a lot of sense to me but now I’m not too sure. I recently had a dream where I became angry at a character I had never met before. I tried to punch them and got that familiar “no effect” type of result.But last night I really hurt one of my dream characters.Someone I once hung out with regularly in waking life.

I’m not sure if the difference came from levels of dream awareness as I was more aware that I was dreaming in my “no effect experience” (if that makes any sense to you all). Or if it could have been the fact that I was familiar with the second person.

Either way I thought this was pretty interesting,the lack of punching power in dreams has always intrigued me. I’ve always wondered what might cause it. Could it be guilt or uncertainty?

1) I was in 2nd year of Junior High when i had a dream about me attending a new school and i don't know if you can understand but in Greece every time a new school year starts we have the priest of the district's church and bless us for a good school year. Anyhow, i watched as this ceremony took place and i was watching but here is the thing. The school in my dream look way different then the one i was going. The Principal of this dream school was a woman with blond hair. My actual pricipal was a man with black hair. I didn't mind it and let this dream go when a year later we moved and guess what? I found myself staring at the same school building as my dream, the same pricipal as in my dream. I instantly freaked out! I started breathing deeply and i tried to calm myself. But how could i see this dream a year ago and to happen nonetheless!

2) I dreamed that i was trapped between a wall and a computer desk with very expensive computer connected on top and i was trying to unplug something. I was sort of half way kneeling half way not and my knees were in pain. I didn't even think much about it. On 12th of December what i saw in my dream happened thank god my professor walked into the classroom and helped me out. But i freaked out again!

3) A few months ago i dreamed that i was doing a casting and one of my actors was laughing to some mispelled word he said while he was drinking from a silver metal water container and as i turned towards the third person in my dream i saw my classmate Jim playing on his phone. At the period of time in real life i was just told that for my 2nd Year in college i should complete two short movies and i have chosen to do a mini documentary and i was in the process of writing a script for my second short movie when i saw tha dream. Yesterday, i held the casting for the second short movie and what i had dreamt happened down to the last word and i was aware of it then i started having a headache that only lasted half hour before i drank hot coffee and ate a bit of chocolate. The actor i was casting and i had seen in my dream his name was Kostas and honestly i had just met him a week ago yet i had seen him in my dream. Also, i had decided to pair up with Jim and Orestis because they had no essay and we would get a pretty good grade plus they had cameras and knew how to hande Adobe Premiere and i needed to see them how they work it so i can use it when i edit my documentary and i knew i could ask them for any tips i needed also i had worked one way or the other with the rest of the class but those two.

They say two times is a coincidence and third a pattern...so am i a psychic? Because that would be beyond weird and cool at the same time. Because in all honesty i have been many times told by my dad that mum and i do those things and many times mum has said things that happened a few days later and when we asked her how she knew she told me she felt a gut feeling.

Then i had a gut feeling that my grand-aunt was in danger and when i was calling her she wasn't picking up the phone so i called an ambulance to go to her house (we live 7 hours away) and she had suffered a heart attack by herself and she was laying paralyzed with the phone a fingertip away from her reach! That was three years ago! 

This summer there was a wildfire that lasted three days and burnt five towns and killed 99 people and i was an hour away from my grand-aunt and my dad had to physically keep me busy all thedays so i wouldn't get in a bus and go to her. I had this feeling that she was in danger and i was right! Two days after the fire was dealt with and they were cleaning the towns my grand-aunt called us to tell us she was safe and she had opened her house to other people who have lost theirs. When i asked her if she was in danger she let a shaky laugh and told me that she saw the fire burn her neighborhood and her balcony yet the inside of the house wasn't touched and she sat there watching the fire and praying because she knew if she left or opened a door any door the fire would get in, she stayed locked in her living room for two days with crackers and whiskey as a means of food and prayed as she watch the world burn. In that moment i cried too. She is 83 years old and has survived WW2 and Civil War and now this! I couldn't be more proud of her!

4) Then as i was watching the news of towns looking like ghost towns i saw a road near my grand-aunt's neighborhood that had a cinema and i remembered a dream of mine that i saw the first night after we had learnt of the wildfire. I remember that i was in that very same street my limps were on fire specifically my legs and i was watching people around me running away or being burnt as i stood there yelling for my grand-aunt. I had also remember how i walked into a fast food store and there were people using any means to treat burns and they had helped me then i met this little boy that was looking for his parents and his parents were right behind him as i told him that he said that they couldn't see him. I panicked and woke up crying my sister woke up too because we were in the same room and i asked if we could sleep on the same bed. I was afraid of falling asleep again. And as i was watching the news in real life of that street there was a talk of a fast food store that now was a makeshift hospital. As they were reading the names of the dead and showing pictures of missing kids and adults the boy i had seen in my dream poped up as one of the missing ones. A day later he was found burnt inside the cinema...his parents were looking for him...

I was able to play it with ease and easily beat it. It was a bit after that, that was when they let me know that I was one of twenty-one selected beta-testers. These beta-testers were testing different games throughout the month, games that were supposed to be released in the far future. At the end of the month, every single beta-tester would be assassinated.
Of course, I didn't want a part of this. I told them that I was out and that I wouldn't be a part of this test. They said I had no choice and that even if I only played one game unknowingly, I was chosen since I was a little child for this role and could not refuse it. So, I browsed the game selection. There was a facility in person I could visit. I did and saw they had different sections for different styles of games. I did not like any of them besides the game I first played. They all looked boring and bland.
I told them to go fuck themselves and that I would not play their games anymore. It was then they started to stalk and hunt me. I got a text telling me where I was. This part felt like a game, because while I felt some of it, it was very miniscule. I also could oddly sense where they were. I went downstairs to get something to drink when I was ambushed by people in masks. They sliced my stomach, cut my nose off, and made it to where my intestines and stomach were exposed. I went to the hospital and lived barely. I lost my memory for a while but knew to always look behind me.
I met this kid who wanted to help me so I stayed at his place. We decided to investigate the company together. Now, this felt morel like reality. We found their inspirations. Different torture scenes from movies, one of which I recognized. It was Saw. But, the scene in particular did not happen in the movie. After we saw the pack of things which showed what inspired them, we knew they would come. 
We fought seven of them, I fought five and the kid fought two. I got stabbed in the hand with a spork but other than that, we dominated them. The mother of the kid came home for some reason and scolded the kid for using her tablet saying she was using that to snipe on some game (WTF). The kid was sorry. 
During the next few days, I hitched a ride with someone on a bike in almost like a game. There was a mini-map and pop-up menus but I was inside it. I eventually got off the bike and went back to the kids place. Now, things seemed more like a game compared to reality. We went into a car to drive somewhere when we saw one of the men in the uniform of the company trying to kill me. We ran him over. More came and we ran them over. Eventually, they surrounded the car and pulled me out. The dream asked if I wished to continue, like it was a game over screen. I said no.

I was driving somwhere and wanted to stop in new Orleans to try the food. (Didn't make it there)
We went somewhere else for a bit and then started driving home.

On the way back our car broke down somewhere before California. We later found out we were in Arizona.

I was towed to a house that was unfamiliar and when i knocked on the door it was my ex and another girl i didn't know.

My ex was sexual with me and then other guys came in and she started to be sexual with them. She was some sort of sex worker.

I left the house upset. When i walked away from the house i was at a mall. I opened up google maps and lifted my phone i was able to see a bunch of blue bubbles over people that were talking, in some sort of AR mode.

When i pinched to zoom in i could hear these people's conversations it was super creepy and i remember thinking so in the dream.

I left and went back to the house to confront my ex and she was performing sex acts on another guy. The room was filled with guys and there was a girl with all of them.

I left the house again to get in my car and leave and when i found my car it was modified heavily. The back end looked kind of like a box truck and it had gas canisters all over it.

Last night I had a really vivid eerie dream. The dreamscape was immense it was dark yet also warmly and oddly lighted. The landscape was that of endless rolling hills. They were covered with large rows of wind chimes or something that closely resembled bells floating in perfect symmetry. Each row was shaped beautifully in there own design. Lucidly I started to ring them and each had their own unique tone and sound. These object seemed to go on infinitely across the vast landscape in my excitement I could sense the presence of a friendly character to my left watching me in amusement. After a few rings of the various rows the rest of them seemed to start to ring on there own for miles. This is when things got a little weird. All of the sudden to my left me and my companion, who i never got a look at, both  turned to see a row of flood lights turn on to illuminate an unsymmetrical row of bells. These seemed out of place and a voice said don't go there its most definitely one of his traps. It was like i lost control though and started towards the row. Off behind the lights i could see a dark figure in a black robe seemingly floating with a evil sense around it. The figure like I had said wore a dark robe and had a really emotionless mask that was made of the same slate like material that the objects were made of. At this point I woke up and I swore the figure was still manifested in the corner of my room. It scared the shit out of me and I haven't been able to stop thinking of it.

&#x200B;

I had to wave my brothers and dad goodbye as my mom desperately drove me away in our car. As she wove through the crumbling streets and highways, I looked out the window and saw large fiery rocks falling from the sky. 

The buildings around us fell onto each other and then I seemingly zoomed out of my body to watch as a meteor fell directly on our car. It smashed into our car, crushing and melting it.

 Although then I had to watch as the ground gave way and a deep wound in the earth opened up and swallowed it up.

&#x200B;

When I was in my body (Before I zoomed out) I felt large amounts of terror, however the moment I was pulled away I felt content and at peace. Although I was worried about my mom greatly.

On my free time I’d smoke out of pipes and bongs with my best friends from my day to day life even meeting new ones I would also jump through black holes that looked like extra dimensional portals where I’d die and come back to life. Sometimes I’d get in trouble with the teacher other times I’d do good deeds for them but it abruptly came to an end and without my knowing they ranked everything I did and told me what I was going to do with my life... earlier within my free time me and friends ran into these two girls one was hot the other not very much, as time went by and everyone got the person that would assess them mine was the ugly girl and let’s just say everyone around me succeeded like other people got good jobs such as accountants etc... one girl even became a porn star. When I had to sit down for the assessment she tried to show me how welfare worked but I got mad because I didn’t want the ugly girl and also I couldn’t comprehend what made me deserve this life path (looking back at the other people I noticed my slacker friend got the same thing which he well deserves) and so I ditched the place but immediately I realized I was a long way from home. I go to the front office of this huge building which was mass producing these kids futures and asked where I was. They told me but the one thing I can’t remember is the name of the place even though that wasn’t my question I asked again and they said the name of a city I don’t live in but it’s quite close irl which I barely go to myself irl. I checked out and walk out the front doors with my assessment papers and handbooks in hand. I take a peak at them realizing everything is prewritten for me (what I like and will do) once again I got angry at this so I closed them. I then run into these Asian people working in the trades and they instantly become my buddies because I told them this is my true destiny. We laughed and talked but I still had that horrible gut feeling about everything I went through inside that building. They told me what to expect in a few years and weirdly this one guy I became instant buddies with asked to look at my papers from the school, he dropped them and I saw a future version of myself for a quick second. He didn’t pick them up but showed me around. Then the big buzzer went, their job was over everything around me that was in process stopped working, it got darker and everyone got to go home but sill having no clue where I was I told my buddy and followed him to the nearest bus stop. Realizing I forgot my papers that he had dropped I ran all the way back to grab them, I then realized I didn’t have my phone so I went inside the building to check it out. The place looked slightly different this time but not caring I grabbed my phone off a chair I must have forgotten it in. A bunch of friends of mine I hardly ever see since they live so far away were on the front text supporting me.

0.0,a6u3ja,0.0,1.0,"I have weird nightmares every night but this stuck with me for some reason. I had this dream last night and never dreamt anything like it before. I may start posting more nightmares I remember on this reddit page. 

It started out with me waking up in a booth. The back was solid but the front was wide open. The sides were solid as well as there were other booths that were next to mine. When you're inside the booth, you cannot move until the killing game starts. So, I was stuck. It seems like the game was more competitive since some other survivor drew blinds in front of my booth. Therefore, I could not see what was outside the booth. I heard the killer start rustling around. 

My power in the dream was the ability to leave my body. So, I flew to see what the spirit was doing. I saw her fiddling with a key and a picture of me. I knew her in the dream but I do not know her in real life. In the dream, she had some type of romantic significance to me.

I was able to get out of the booth and talk to her. She told me she was going to let me go. For some reason, I had immense romantic feelings for this girl. But, I discovered the way out through looking it up on a computer located in the house this was being held. I accidentally ran into her and she slashed my stomach. She was very apologetic. When I let her know I was hurt really bad, she let me know I could not leave the trial until I was healed by someone.

So, she started to look for the other survivors to heal me. Almost all of them refused and were murdered permanently. The last survivor who was trying to escape agreed to heal me. So, he mended my wounds and I was back to normal; like the slash never even happened. As a reward, she let him out of the trial. 

She told me that it was time for me to go. But, I did not want to go. I held onto her and told her about how it was always my dream to be in a world separate from everyone else with the one I loved. I said that this world was better than the real world and that I wanted to stay here. She appeared sad. She told me that there was one thing I forgotten. She handed me a piece of paper.

On the paper were images of me, then of some of the things I did in the trial, then of her with crazy expressions with her face distorted, then of images of me dying from my perspective along with (oddly) a profile pic of my friend that he uses on steam. The paper also says that while the others deaths are permanent, mine will only be for about a week. Then, I should be revived.  I look up confused to see her smiling with a crazy look in her eye. She looks me dead in the eye and says ""I'm crazy."" I start to get scared but she pounces on top of me and starts to strangle me. She chokes me and then I woke up.

Any advice for what this could mean? I would really appreciate it.

0.0,a2nbh4,2.0,2.0,"I had a dream last night, where I was in a tropical river, probably Amazon. A bunch of people were with me. While I do not remember the identities, I remember they were extremely important to me, so it was most probably my family and maybe some friends.

For some reason that I never questioned, they wanted to build houses on the river ( stilt houses should be the correct term). They were discussing over engineering details, like how will they dig the riverbed for the foundation, what materials to use, will the houses resist the river etc. One of the people had engineering background so she was giving informed advice.

I was listening attentively and spoke up, suggesting we could instead use the leafs of Victoria Amazonica to build small houses, since they were large, strong, and all over the river. Everybody liked the idea so we started discussing of a concrete plan. 

We were worried that water might come in from tears in the leafs and we should insulate the leafs. Again I stepped in suggesting we could use plastic bags to insulate the tears in leafs. We got into working, and I took a supervising role, making suggestions on how to best use the plastic bags to cover as much surface as possible.

Notes:

* I often dream about water, though the type, color, nature etc is prone to change. For some reason those dreams always leave very strong impressions and affect me.

* The civil engineer in the group is probably my older sister, though I wasn't identifying anyone while dreaming. But she is a civil engineer and she usually takes charge or at least steps in with solid evidence and realistic points of view in real life. Right now we are not in speaking terms and since she moved to another country and got married, she has been participating way less in family matters.

* While no one ever ever said that the river was Amazon (or why we were there), I woke up with the impression that that's where we were. Checking facts about the way the river looked like, the leafs as well as type of house we initially wanted to build, that must have been where we were.

* I watched a Lost episode last night where Michael makes use of his construction background to contribute in problem - solving, so certain aspects of the dream could be an echo of the episode.

* All my ideas in the dream are actually pretty unrealistic and wouldn't really work. In real life I am pragmatic in daily matters. However when thinking, planning or making decisions I am  idealistic, open to new ideas, impractical and often more concerned with what lies ahead than the here and now.

I was getting ready for work, and I went outside in my front yard, topless, to do my makeup. In the process of doing so, I thought to myself, ""I shouldn't be outside topless."" And went to go back inside my house to finish. On my way in, I see a red pickup truck, parked along side my SUV, so close, that the passenger door wouldn't be able to open.

We look out the window and see hundreds of members of isis walking down the street, putting bullets through houses and cars. They come by to our house and surround the place. We had expected them to do that as we, being in the military, were people of interest to them. 

We had our escape path and fled to the nearest diner that was prepped for this invasion. The owner, Chief Matthews, greeted us as we came in through the back. He told us our stuff was in the office. Ammunition and Kevlar vests and guns and knives lined the walls. We each suited up and hid in the diner. Chief told us to get down behind the diner booth. 

An isis member walks in casually, greets the chief as an old friend, goes to shake his hand and pulls out a knife to stab him. He succeeds but not too soon after did he find a bullet in is skull. Chief died. It was up to us. We had our shipmates scattered through the town all prepared for the same thing we were doing. 

We took our places outside behind cars. The next half hour was a call of duty style battle. But it felt real. I watched my brother who I’ve known since boot camp and maybe even before killed in the line of Fire. Promising to avenge his death, I place the heads of my enemies next to him. Hopefully letting him know I had succeeded. The battle waged on. 

We were advancing, closing in on the building that they had infiltrated months ago. A swarm of isis filtered out. I pinned each one of them off. But the hoard kept filing out. I was running out of ammo. I looked around and my division was dropping like flies. I noticed they had a vent which led down to a boiler room. I tossed a grenade and it went down through the vent...and I waited. 

Within seconds, the entire building was up in flames. Body parts flying, trying not to breath in the smoke from the fire...the smoke cleared and a few isis members were fleeing. I wasn’t gonna let them get away that easily. There were three of us left. We chased them for blocks. Saving our last bullets for them. We cornered them in an alley. We pulled the trigger. It was over. 

I shot red flares up into the sky signaling the end. The streets filled with civilians. All cheering. I got recognition for things I didn’t feel I deserved as I was just doing my job. It was a time of peace in this town.

So it starts with me on some sort of mini spacecraft and I look out the window to see galaxies around me, all miniscule, possibly to portray how fast I'm going. The spacecraft comes to the ""end"" of the universe and breaks through it, if that makes sense - like the universe is a balloon, and the expansion of the universe is the balloon getting blown up. After breaking through the edge of the universe, I'm travelling through darkness until I come up to this house floating in the middle of nothingness. It stops in the driveway and I'm ushered in by an old guy in a suit. He pulls out a 50 inch plasma TV and pulls up a REALLY long profile of mine. He introduces me to 'myself' and starts talking about my whole life, and begins adding up everything good and bad that I've done in my life to determine whether I'd make it into heaven. He concluded that I wasn't pure, and as he was about to teleport away, I was in the middle of asking him about whether there was a god created my universe when alarms went off which scared me so much that I backed into and accidentally broke the TV, which turned the room a blood red colour. 

I freaked out and jumped back into the vehicle that brought me here, and seconds later it kicked me out, dropping me into a park at night. After this, I spent about a minute being chased by this 7ft monster whilst eventually navigating my way through (and exiting) a cornfield, then running forward through a pitch black empty space.

It was about some random building information, but it had enough legitimate evidence to prove it's a letter from the future.

I ran up to my cousin who had walked quite far down the road whilst I was being shellshocked reading the letter from 2018. I kept thinking in my head 'what if she rejects the idea' or 'what if no one should be allowed to see this' as I got closer and closer to her. I finally caught up and as I was about to hand the letter over to her, she, along with the close environment, froze in place. Out of nowhere, a gust of wind took me off my feet,  taking the control away from my body, and flung me across the road. Before I could land on the other side of the street and feel any pain, a mild shock went through my body and I woke up, but it wasn't the usual shock that would normally cause me to wake up. It was a weaker sensation.

There was no alarm/no room intrusion/no bedside fan being turned on/no scary happenings at the end of my dream to wake me up by force. I went to bed at 4AM, and I woke up around 10:30AM.

0.0,9zfjbq,0.0,1.0,"This is a X-post from /r/Nightmares  
I don't have this nightmare very often, but I've had it several times over the last couple of years  
Its actually a recurring one, and normally I forget all about it, until it occurs again.

This time however I've remembered it (atleast parts of it) because my GF had left a message on my phone when I woke up, asking me if I slept well, to which I replied that I had, had a reoccuring nightmare.  


Its very abstract and its not so much about monsters and the like, but I'll try to explain it.   
Basically it takes place in real life. Gradually I realize that weird and uncanny shit is happening around me, It can be stuff like people acting different compared to what they normally do, to people disappearing etc.  


An example of that from this morning would be that my best friend for many  years disappeared during a social event, or got abducted before me or some shit like that. The next day I wake up and don't remember anything about that. Then I meet my friend and it hits me ""oh shit something bad happened with him last night"" I can't really put my finger on what had happened but I know he should'nt be here, and especially not acting like nothing had happened.  
While I can't remember a specific example of this I am sure that in some versions of these nightmares, people have died before me. In some cases they are killed, or atleast severely wounded, and then I meet them again and everything is just fine and dandy.  


I get a feeling like someone or something is working in the shadows, trying to make everything seem normal to me, and possibly other people, and somehow semi-mind controlling people, or atleast steering people into thinking everything is okay. I don't know what their goal or purpose is, but I just get a feeling of dread, like I know they have sinister motives. This could be people, or it could be aliens, or aliens disguised as human, I don't really know, I just know that their motives are bad.  
I get shivers just thinking about this.  


Anyway, I try to keep my composure and act normal, fearing that ""they"" will realize that I am ""waking up"" or starting to realize what is going on around me.  
I Subtly try to prod my friend about last night, but he kindda ignores my questions or dodges them by being distracted by something else, steering the conversation in a different topic - overall his whole personality seems.. off, but I can't really determine why. Then somehow we end up in like an alley or another street-setting at night. something is chasing us, I can't really  remember what or if we even knew what it was in the dream, but we are hiding and we are scared as fuck - my friend seems normal until he starts acting like nothing is wrong and kindda outs us by standing up and walking away, then a bright light blinds me.  
Suddenly we are at a supermarket, like wallmart or some shit. Once again I have been ""reset"" and forgot about what had happened. We are a group of friends talking, laughing, having a good time. Then once again I get a weird feeling - Something is wrong, off, uncanny. I get paranoid and I feel like everyone around us in the supermarket are keeping an eye on us, watching us, but when I kindda look around everyone acts just like normal people shopping but again - something is just.. wrong about this. I then get a very intense feeling like there is a certain area - a zone, around me and my friends, and as long as we stay within this zone we wont get ""caught"". In sudden bout of fear I ask my friends something along the lines of ""Can you not feel something is wrong?"" and say that they must be able to see this ""zone"" that we have to stay within. And like that, I wake up. I realize I've been having the nightmare again, and I feel relieved. But I also realize that I am still kindda asleep, cant really wake up - I wouldnt call it full blown sleep paralysis, cus I'm not actually totally woken up, but I am concious and aware that I am dreaming. This freaks me out because I don't want to fall back into the nightmare, and I try really hard to stay awake. Then I realize that I have already started dreaming again, because I hear my girlfriend talking to someone about all this scary shit, and how I had to be kept in the dark, but I knew she was at work in real life.  


I then force myself awake once more, but I make sure it is for real by getting out of bed immediately as I wake up.  


Once again, this is not a traditional nightmare, atleast not for me, I usually get nightmares that are more realistic, about me being sick, losing my teeth etc. but this once is just so fucking scary because there is this constant overwhelming feeling of dread and like something is off and wrong but I can't put my finger on it or prove it.",hot,A Recurring nightmare Ive been having for a few years,1.0
0.0,9z5pk4,1.0,1.0,"In this dream I was surrounded by witches. They wore the classic black pointed witch hats, some of them looked like any regular human being would, while some looked like they were hundreds of years old. They were all signing a contract that looked to be made of cloth. It was pinned on the wall. Some of them just signed it while others also wrote little messages on it. At the end, there was a capital letter Z. (My name starts with a Z.) They all looked to me, waiting for me to sign. I asked them what I was signing because I was unsure, and they tried to explain but all of the sound suddenly became muffled and inaudible. The witches looked at me confused, and I kept saying ""I can't hear you, I can't hear anything."" One of them reached out to me with a hand that had long fingernails and was covered in small bumps and boils. It was the color of beets (the hand). She reached into my ear with one long finger. She pulled out a lump of earwax, then she pulled out a small, fleshy, dark red/purple lump. I was starting to hear better. Then she reached in again and was trying to pull out something else. Then I woke up.

What could this mean? I have dreamed of witches before but usually they are out to get me. I have also dreamed of not being able to hear/hearing everything muffled before, but never in the same dream as witches.

0.0,9x727x,1.0,1.0,"Last night I had a very vivid dream which left me confused when I woke up. Almost every night I have a dream or two that I remember immediately upon waking up and I usually lose them by the end of the day. I am still a little off put by this one in particular, though. I thought maybe I would have a better understanding of it if I wrote it down. If anyone has any thoughts or possible interpretations of it, please let me know.  I would be thrilled to have some feedback. 

My dream started off as me nine months pregnant in labor with my first child. I gave birth to her painlessly and it was a very beautiful moment even though I was alone in the process. I don't remember the switch from the birth setting to my house. My mom was hovering me and telling me how to take care of my baby, which I absolutely opposed. I named her Daiya. I have never known anyone with this name before and I'm not really sure where it came from but I think its a really pretty name, nonetheless.

Everything about this dream felt so real. I held my baby girl in awe. She felt like a real baby does in our world. Usually in dreams I lose my sense of touch, but this baby had weight and was soft and beautiful. I even changed her diaper at one point, not something I would imagine doing in a dream. But something about this dream made the baby seem so real to me. As if I really had her and she was really mine.

Everyone was coming out of the wood work to see my new child.  The freakiest part of this dream however, is that my current boyfriend was nowhere to be found. It was like he didn't exist. In fact, the father of my child was my ex from about three years ago. 

In the dream, I consciously knew he was the father of the baby and I hadn't seen or slept with him since I conceived Daiya. The father didn't even know that I was pregnant. I hid it from everyone. No one knew until I had her until I posted about it on my ""finsta"" account. (I know, crazy, right??) Everyone who had come to see me and the new baby was trying to convince me to call the father and tell him that I had given birth to his baby. It wasn't that simple, though. 

I didn't want to tell him. How would he react to being a new father? Surely he would be mad that I kept my whole pregnancy from everyone, especially him. And on top of that, I didn't want to share my new pride and joy with him, or anyone for that matter. I was convinced I would raise her and take care of her all by myself. I cared for her until the minute I woke up. It was confusing at first because after I opened my eyes. I had to sperate my dream from reality. This dream almost made my want to contact my ex and just ask what's been up with him lately. It's been over a year since I've talked to him. I just wanna know why I'm still so off put by it. I can't stop thinking about it. It was just *so real.*

I stood in front of my windows with my back to them and face tothe wall. To my left is the hallway to the rooms of the apartment. I’m just standing there and I look over to the hallway and theres a girl or woman or teenager of whatever, standing there. She looks like she was doing digging. She was dirty. Her hair was a mess and wet and covering her face. She was wearing a dirty white dress. Skin all decayed. Dirty finger nails. Her arms were covered in white tape or cloth or something. I’m staring at her and I’m frozen. I can’t move. I’m panicking and can’t react. I stare and I just see her bolt towards me like a maniac and she runs up behind me and with her left arm wraps it around my left arm and stomach. She covers my mouth with her right. I could feel the bandages covering her hand and arm. The texture brushing on me. Her hair tickling my ear and neck. I can’t move at all. It’s starts getting real loud, the thoughts in my head, “help helppp” And a few seconds after standing there I wake up in bed. Goosebumps all over my body. I get up and I’m heated. I’m furious. I swung my door open and take two steps out and stare to my right where the hallway is. And I shout “go away. right now go” I don’t know why I said it. But someone had just grabbed up on me a few seconds before. One can understand... it was 4am when I woke up and shouted into nothing. Ever since then. I’ve had sleeping problems. Everyone that knows me always ask me “why don’t you ever sleep” “you don’t get tired ?” Bc I fall asleep relatively late. I fall asleep at around 3 or 4am and wake up and hour later and start my day.

I have 2 kids I'm a disabled vet. That picked up the role of stay at home dad. I'm a believer in aliens. And I'm a calm cool and rational person. OK on to the dreams. The first one, I was at Disney world in flordia (I live in Louisiana) and as i walked through the gate. I noticed an E.T craft in the park. As I walk to it. A ramp comes down and a small gray, walked out and took my hand. He led me into the ship, and proceeded to tell me how somthing big is coming, something that will affect the entire planet. He then went on to say that I was chosen, and that I it was very important that I remember where the ship first landed. When i woke, it had felt so real that, I truly believed it happend. To the point I could not separate my mind from dream and real life.

  THE SECOND dream, I was laying outside star gazing as I always do. Than I began to notice the  Aurora borealis in my sky, I though that it was odd due to me living in Louisiana, so I ran inside to grab my wife. And as we went back outside. It was daytime. And all the clouds in the sky started glitching. They changed colors and shapes, than all of a sudden the clouds turned into raw code. Like a simulation, than shortly sparks started flying from the sky, we ran inside and laid in bed.

This dream really got to me, weirder thing is that this was a nap dream. I was in this mall arcade (I am an old school type of guy who is an arcade fanatic). It was a Senior class trip with people I didn't know (except for one of my group members which is a good friend of mine.) I was playing till I ran out of quarters, and I went downstairs to the machine to trade bills for quarters. On the way down I noticed more people, and I made some jokes and said hi as I pass by, and they were quite rude. I came back up and gave my friend some more quarters to play. As I start to play, that is the last thing that happens. Everything goes black and I feel my soul leave and return, and I am awaken back into this hospital with very faint vision. My parents are there and siblings as well around my bed, and I just got chills because I had a feeling I knew exactly what happened. I had an encounter with death of some sort. My mom and dad were crying and my siblings could not be any happier to see me. The TV was on the news channel, and they were talking about a situation that happened at the mall I was at, and it didn't take long to realize it was me that they were talking about. I go back out into blackness and wake up in my dream, to see my cousin and sibling eating breakfast, while everyone else at work. I felt like I got a good rest and I had completely forgot what happened for a split second. That day wasn't very memorable, but the day after, I go back to class (weirdly enough wasn't in school) and see my teacher and everyone else. They were all shocked to see me. I didn't really know what was going on other that the fact that the only knowledge I have was looking at the news and seeing that I had **DROWNED** and came back to life, and that it was a miracle for me to be here. I had some knowledge that my friend threw water in my face as a joke, which quickly became a freak accident (which is how i drowned). But the feeling of regret in my dream was telling me I had attempted suicide and did not succeed. After class ended I asked my teacher (which I wrote a thank you card for today in real life) what happened to me, to see what students had told him and to see what he understands of my situation. (I honestly cant remember much of what he said other than me drowning and living, the month is January and my story made headlines nationwide). There were YouTube videos of the 911 call and I was just feeling this emptiness inside me. I have contemplated how hard it would land on my parents if they lost me, and that isn't a good feeling (which is one of the many reasons why I detest suicide). In the dream, I heard my mother's worry on the 911 call. I was feeling what she was feeling, emptiness. I felt awful and at that point very cared for from my parents. Weirdly enough however there was this corner store that I went to since I waited for my parents to get me. I was so careless that I grabbed a whipped cream can and started eating straight from it. I was going to put it back but a worker saw me and I had to look like I was going to pay for it. He was trying to have a conversation, and I asked him if he can tell I am empty and is able to see physically what I just went through. I told him my story, that I attempted and didn't succeed, and midway through my story, a woman comes up to me and asked if I was the guy that survived. She hugged me out of care and compassion and happiness for my soul. I had felt the slight happiness and carefree for a second. When she let go is when I did not feel it. I did not pay for anything and looked out the window and saw my dads car, looked to my left and hes looking out the window too. Then I woke up and all my dark feeling went away. I called up my friend and told her the story, she told me the context of drowning in a dream meaning that all the work and stress is making you feel like you are underwater. I have had dreams of drowning, but I have never felt the death part of it, or why I felt that darker emptiness energy; which is why I came here to see if anyone can help me interpret. (Yes I am an actual senior in high school and yes I am going through stress with college and the whole application process. Which is probably why I drowned during the application process and awoke from my coma after the date that it finishes, but who knows if there is a more deeper meaning to it).

I started at the top of a series of steps and all I had to do was walk down all the steps and into a side room with an open wooden door and I win the level, almost like some sort of game format. Easy right? Now, I discover as this game goes on and I start to look back at what I have done that there was a little girl following me a ways behind and that the “steps” are actually memories from this little girl's life, when she reached the new step I got to see the new memory (there was even fun happy music and the little girl was laughing). The longer I looked the more memories I saw of her life. But I could always go back to the side room with the wooden door at the end and it would ""restart"" the level again, back at the top of the stairs.

The twist here was the longer I looked back at the little girl following me, the closer she got as she took steps down the stairs, and suddenly when she got within like 5 or 6 steps of me the happy music started to change, you know the twinge of a violin that is in a horror movie? Well that started to happen. And the longer I stared at her, her face started to shift into something demonic, and eventually when I looked for too long and she got within like 3 steps of me on the stairs the wooden door to the side room slammed shut and I lost the ability to go into the “safe space” that restarted the game. And I could no longer look away from her face and I had nowhere to move and I had to watch as she eventually morphed into a complete demon and killed me.

0.0,9sxtko,0.0,3.0,"So I just woke up from this dream a few hours ago and I had to share it but I had no one to share with so here it is. 
 
I'll just preface this a bit with some real life context, my mom who I am very close to is a complete mess. She is struggling with alcoholism and it's been getting better but yesterday she had a bad relapse and was found walking through a grocery store with over 3 grams of alcohol in her blood (according to my sister) and collapsed and had to be taken to the ER. I live pretty far away and had no way of coming home for any of this so I've just been stewing in anxiety and bad feelings. 

I dreamed that she had a concussion from the fall and the doctors decided to open her up and fix it (bullshit science I know but I was dreaming so sue me). While they had her head open she had some sort of unexplained cerebrovascular accident and died. That's it she was gone. 

They called me to the hospital and announced what had happened when I got there, I was completly numb to the whole thing. The nurse gave me my mom's car keys and said I now had a car which I drove to a parking lot down town until I realised i don't actually know how to drive and I should probably call a friend. At that point it really hit me that she was gone for good so I ran back to the hospital and demanded to see her hoping that maybe it was somebody else's mom who had died and maybe they had called me by mistake, I was looking for anything but the truth because it just couldn't be and I couldn't accept it. 

They took me back to see her body except they had cut her up into all these pieces, her head was on top of a pile of plastic bags that where supposed to contain the rest of her and her kind face was frozen in a silly expression she used to do to cheer me up when I was little but now it looked grotesque. The nurse pulled out a plastic sheet and put it on the floor and started laying out the rest of her so I could say goodbye but it was just meat to me. It didn't even look vaguely human and just like a pile of flesh from the butcher shop. None of it was her and I was barefoot for some reason and standing in her blood.


I woke up right after that and for a few minutes I couldn't remember if it was really just a dream and I burst into tears. All I want now is to just go hug my mom but I can't and probably won't be able to before Christmas and it's killing me.

Someone had found a cave, gone inside and came out with what seemed like a jar of black fluid. It was viscous, but stuck to the walls of the container. The lid seemed a bit melted. The guy who had gone in had gotten a bit on his hand, but he didn't feel anything when it touched his skin. A few people commented on how strange it was that he'd picked it up, but he ran his hand in a stream nearby and called it a day. Over the day, he seemed to get weaker. He began to slur words. He started to stumble and become delirious. We rushed back to a nearby building to try and see if he had heatstroke or something, as he was wearing a long coat. That's when someone noticed almost his entire arm up to his shoulder was black, bubbling and caustic smelling. It seemed like chunks of his arm had fallen off onto the coat sleeves. People asked him if he could feel his arm, but he simply replied that it felt fine, if not a bit heavy. We made a bed out of whatever we could find and kept an eye on him. As soon as the mark on his arm spread to his chest and stomach, he threw up. It was pure black caustic fluid. Some drops splashed on people. Some splashed on food. Anything it touched seemed to spread rapidly and burn everything it touched. I remember getting a few drops on my hand. I washed it for ages, but all it seemed to do was make it spread onto the sink, as the more I washed the more it spread. When the black mark spread to the rest of him, he melted into a black viscous puddle. That burnt through the bed and the floor, and notably, his backpack where the rest was contained. The puddle kept growing, the marks on everything kept growing, I began to become weak, and then everything went black and I woke up.

about two months ago i was at a retreat where i met a woman i was rooming with. we weren’t close or anything, but she was nearly 40 and very eccentric. she would say things like “i can tell that this person was hurt in their past life” and constantly talk about her out-there philosophies—she was very much about herself. That’s really all i recall about her. 

The other day i had a dream i was working in her home. She seemed to be running some sort of sewing business, i don’t remember what it was. But i was sitting at a desk, doing vague work, probably working as an intern. While i know for sure in real life she didn’t have children and wasn’t in a relationship, in the dream she had a son and a daughter. 

All three of them were in the other room, where I could see them. At first I didn’t pay attention. Then i realized that the girl was naked, the son was laying down with his pants off, and the both was sitting on a stool, watching them while sewing a garment at the same time. 

This is where it gets gross. The mother directed her daughter to touch her brother. She told her to give him a bl*wjob, to feel him up, etc, all this while making her clothes at her desk. The girl did everything as directed. 

My dream self could see everything that was happening, and I remember being very very nauseous. There was something extremely off-putting (more off putting than it already was) and I couldn’t put my finger on it, until i realized.

The girl was 12 or 13. The boy was about 8. 

I was being subjected to child p*rn.

In the dream I started to freak out, wanting to vomit. I went into the other room and asked the mother why she was doing this. She said it was because her son was feeling sick and tired, and her daughter needed to learn how to treat men when they’re in pain. She said it was only natural.

The last thing I remember was the girl and boy, emotionlessly listening to their mother, and I was being forced to watch it all. 

What does this mean? How do i erase this horrible thing from my mind?

I was doing a project in college, that had multiple steps to it and each of them were graded. I don't remember what the project was about, but I know I had good grades on all the parts of the project, except one.
The last part of the project it's where it gets creepy. Our professor, some lady, gives us an additional 10% if we lay down on a wooden table with circular saw blades and a track- so the blade can move left to right. So we had to lay on it, one by one, attached, and let ourselves get split in half, while still being alive. It's sounds very disturbing, but, every student's lined up on the chairs facing the wooden table, and each student, in alphabetical order would go on the table and get themselves split in half alive. There were screams, blood, but no fear, except for me and my only friend, we were the last ones to go and we fought about who would get on the table first. After a few hours of arguing, he got on that table, and got himself killed. When my turn came, I ran away and my professor told me that I would get a bad grade if I didn't do it. I ran so much, and it fast forwarded years after this ""project"". I encountered those students who got reconstructed somehow, but deformed… they were shaming me, especially my last friend.

It starts off back home in Fairbanks Alaska, at my grandfathers.  For whatever reason, I always dream of Birch Hill being 20 times larger than it is, and it be a volcano, but we don't know it is until it is too late.  We live very close by to there, and it always affects us.  Anyway, one day, a tear opens at the top, and our top volcanologists discover it is a Volcano!  They find out that it will erupt shortly, and we must prepare to evacuate.  Without warning, it erupts in spectacular form.  Nobody really had time to prepare for this.  Well, our Suburban is missing (I don't know how), so we have to run.  As we are running, we are looking for vehicles to *Ahem* borrow.  At this point, we could honestly care less about others, as family comes first.  We don't find any.  Well, somehow, the area that in real life has houses across the train tracks is actually a massive field.  We run into it.  Now, Somehow, this field stretches for many towns, and there is an airport near it.  However, we run into a patch with houses, and about 500 yards ahead, there is a open pit plane (small, like a twin engine).  My grandfather is somehow pushing me in a type of cart, and my brothers are nowhere to be seen at this point.  At the time, I only had two brothers, so my third doesn't exist in this world, sorry bro.  We come across the plane, and in other dreams where i do this alone, and fly it, he says that the plane would ""Easily crash"".  We push on past the plane, and into the next town.  This is a larger town that is very large, and it has a mega store.  On the outskirts, we find a subdivision.  We spend a good amount of time in a large office type building right before the subdivision looking for stuff, and I find cigs that would be useful in a post-apoc world.  My grandfather yells at me of course.  Then we reach the subdivision.  We go house to house searching for vehicles.  We are about to give up, when we see a a garage opening.  a pregnant mother of 3 (soon to be 4) is getting in her car with her kids.  Somehow my grandfather is able to pay her for the vehicle (guess greed always wine eh?), and we are off.  Well, we don't make it far, and right as we are passing the mega store, our vehicle breaks down.  We look around trying to find a vehicle to... borrow... and can't find any that aren't occupied by viscous rednecks with shotguns.    We go inside, and then right as we are coming out, we see a JET plane taking off.  It doesn't have far to go, as it then nosedives, and explodes.  We then see the white pickup that is right ahead of the lava (sort of a warning to let people know where it is).  When all hope is lost, my mother spots a helicopter about to take off, and violently kicks out the Pilot, sending him to his death.  My grandfather and brothers re-appear in an SUV, and are forced to speed off due to the lava, and there not being enough room for me.  Just when all hope is lost, my mother appears in the helicopter, and tosses me down a ladders.  I grab the ladder right as the lava overtakes the area I was just in, but the ladder snaps, and I plummet to my death.  That is when I wake up.

I've been having this recurring dream where I'm in a car, unsure of where it is going, the car eventually stops, but when I go to step out I'm greeted by a man who's face I cannot see, and he stabs me in the chest. I normally awake around then. Last night I had another dream where I was being murdered but it was much worse and much more vivid. 

&#x200B;

The dream was essentially me, in my room, when suddenly I hear a gunshot in the neighbors apartment above me (the way my apartment is set up is that , it is one house that's been split into a first and second floor, each floor rented out to two different parties). Naturally me and roommates run out of the house, but we all run in different directions. When I think I've outrun the gunman I turn around and there he is. I still cannot see his face. He shoots me in the neck and walks away.  As if I was nothing, like I barely mattered. This is the point when the dream became legitimately terrifying. I didn't wake up like I normally do with the stabbing dreams, right when the fatal blow is hit. Blood, a lot of it, was shooting out of my neck, in an almost cartoonish way, like something out of Kill Bill. But in the dream, it didn't feel like a ridiculous amount of blood, it felt real and natural, and that's what sucked. Although it was a dream, I swear on everything, I could legitimately feel the life draining out of me. It was like  water slipping through my hands, I was trying desperately to cling on to life, I did not want to die, but I could feel it leaving me. I was so scared. Nothing has ever scared me more in my life. There's a certain point where I tell myself, I have to try to stay alive, to not just lie and die like an idiot. I put my hands to my neck to stop the flow of blood, something I've seen done in movies. Later, when I wake up, I'll find my hands actually on my throat as if, in the real world, I was actually trying to stop the flow of blood. My body must have been acting out the dream. My hands get all slippery from the blood, and I'm desperately trying to stand up, but I'm just too weak to... finally, I wake up when I tell myself to breathe slowly in the dream. That's it.

Usually, my dreams are a neutral. Never good or bad, just somewhere in between. But not last night. For the first time in a very long time, i had a nightmare and it was really bad.

I found myself in my sister’s room, (i’m in high school (i’m also a girl) and she’s younger than me, so it’s where i live at the moment) and it was daytime. I couldn’t move. I think i may have been standing up, facing the doorway into her room. In walked a dark shadow-like creature with sort of long, pointy limbs?? The creature looked sort of similar to how “slenderman” is portrayed, but scarier and where it’s face was supposed to be was pitch black. It came towards me and i started screaming as loud as i could, hoping somebody could help. But of course as dreams do, nobody came.

Suddenly i was being carried by the creature, who exuded evil energy. I’m kind of the type of person who has a strong sense of auras/energies of others, and i had never felt anything as awful as that one. I remember looking up at it. Then it started sucking something out of me, it was a stringy sort of gaseous black colored thing, it took it from me and put it into itself. This so far probably lasted about 10 seconds. I still couldn’t move and sound wouldn’t come out. It literally felt like my soul was being sucked out of me.

Then my vision went black. Just completely black, nothing. I felt my entire body start to vibrate at immense speeds, i couldn’t move nor scream, which i was trying to do both. Now i’ve read a small bit about astral projection, and how there’s a “vibration” stage usually within it, and it seems to fit it, but it’s something i knew i should never try until i’m a bit older and know more about spirits and etc.

While my body began to vibrate, i saw an eye opening in my vision, just a single eye (reminded me of the whole third eye thing). The longer i vibrated for, the more it opened. I had a sensation of my body being torn apart, and i had no physical pain. It’s the first time i ever had an experience like this and i was terrified.

I woke up in pure terror, and i was afraid to even move. I probably sat there for 20 minutes until i fell back asleep.

As i said before, nightmares for me are extremely rare. I maybe have one every 4 years, but never like this. This has been haunting me all day and I have anxiety so I am most definitely overreacting.

Is this sort of an out of body experience? Does anyone have any sort of analysis for any part of this? Or am I being paranoid? Anything would be appreciated.",hot,"Scary Dream Experience, does anyone know what this means?",1.0

Last night I woke up on 3 seperate occasions, all the same dream.  


It started with a girl I used to work alongside, I had a mild crush on her, but nothing crazy. She spends time with me, and offers me a massage. This part seemed to take ages, it was more a time lapse of our relationship ending with the massage. She then climbs on top of my back, and begins to rub. Now in my dream this was highly comforting, I felt relaxed and all of a sudden out of nowhere, I hear a foreign language, force her off me and turn around, and she has this dilated black eyes, with this .. evil grin on her face crawling up the bed. This is when I wake up sweating buckets and actually scared. I am not a guy who is easily frightened but this scared the shit out of me.

Last night I had one of these special dreams, and I remember it vividly.  
I woke up a few times this night, so there are parts of it that I can't quite remember.  
Basically I dreamed 3 different parts that belong together:  
In the first part I look at the mirror and weirdly the girl I see does not look like I look in real life... not in the slightest way.  
The second part I have a scary encounter with my bully.  
In the third part my classmates undress themselfs.  


*I dreamed that I was a girl going to highschool.*  
*For a few minutes I had been trying to make my hair look decent.*  
*Then I looked in a mirror to check if it looked ok.*  
*It looked good, my dark thick long hair was basically flowing down in big waves, it looked beautiful.*  
*Then I looked at my face... it was a handsome beautiful face and dark skin.*   
   
*It was one of these days where I did not focus on what the teacher said cause I was distracted.*  
*Earlier this day I had had an encounter with a guy from my school who bullied me.*  
*The scene was very surreal and I can't put it into words, but yeah he was bullying me and I was scared of him.*  
*He had threatened me, and I was to scared to tell anyone about it.*  


*For a reason that I forgot  some students and I had to go see the headmaster.*  
*In that moment my bully stood next to me and threatened me. He pressed his strong hand around my arm and looked me in the eye and threatened me: ""If you tell them that I bullied you, I will...""*  
*I can't remember if he said ""hurt you"" or ""kill you"", I don't even know why he hated me.*   
*Maby it was cause I didn't look like the other students?*  
*He just kept repeating this sentence: ""If you tell anyone I will..... you!""*  
*And pressing my arm harder each time he said it.*  
*At this point I kinda broke. I was threw with accepting him, but still so scared.*  
*I felt tears run down my cheeks as I heard my voice talking back to him:*  
*""Stop it you are hurting me""*  
*He-""If you tell them I will .... you""*  
*I said kinda lowd: ""Make him stop he is hurting me""*  
*As the other teachers and the headmaster and my classmates noticed they looked shocked.*  
*Nobody said anything at this moment...*

&#x200B;

*Then I stop daydreaming, I am back in the classroom and look at the teacher. She doesn't look to happy. She was reading an article with us, and one girl started a discussion about this topic, and other classmates joined in.*  
*The article itself was something about the importance of a skirts length. How a short skirt was bad, and why long skirts were the better and only option. It screamed SEXIST.*  
*So my classmates one after the other stood up and told the teacher that this was bullshit and they were not having it.*  
*They took off their shirts, and some even took off their bra's and wanted to continniue the school lessen this way.*  
*And I went outside the classroom cause I thought it was weird that they were undressing.*

I used to have WONDERFUL beautiful dreams. Then all my dreams were grey. Then for the past few years I ONLY had nightmares. Then this year, a couple months ago, I started being able to go lucid a tiny bit. Then I stopped dreaming altogether again for a week. Now I keep having these detailed confusing dreams!

Don't know if you need backstory.I'm 26f. Puerto Rican & Norwegian. Engaged to a Filipino man who has dated Asian girls before.... I'm only even mentioning that because of the nature of the dream. Was so bizarre and so real! I didn't go lucid and it did not feel like a dream. Dont even know if ethnicity is relevant but... trying to give as much detail as i can!

I was with a group of like 20 people, all Asians... South Korean mostly. We were all friends, just hanging out. My fiance was in the dream too! But we were just friends. I had a crush on him but he liked one of the Asian girls, I never even saw her in the dream. Just remember looking at him staring at her. So, in the dream I was like trying to get over my crush on my friend aka my real life fiance.We were headed somewhere so we all boarded this like double-decker train (like the bus that have 2 levels! but it was a train for sure) After boarding we all got a bit separated.

In the back on the top floor there was a dance floor / stage. And some foods. I was hanging out there just looking around and waiting for the train ride to be over. Then I see some of the group heading out so I go to follow, but then like 50 people flooded where I was and blocked me. So I thought, ""Someone knows I'm here. They'll wait for me or for me. I'll wait right here instead of getting lost since I don't know where anyone is.""

No one remembered me and no one looked for me. LOL. So I just wandered to the back of the room, to wait for the next stop and figure out what to do from there.

I was watching the people on the dance floor for a little while.One of the guys in our group came up to the second floor. He was not super popular, not super attractive, etc, but he was REALLY just... cool. He was also nice. He walked over to me, because he recognized me. He was standing kind of in front of/but to the left of me, body facing me but head looking around the room. He turns back to me and says,""Well. We missed our stop.""I responded, ""..."" just looking at him...like. Ya. No kidding.

He looks straight at me and casually says ""Let's dance to this song. It's nice."" I realized he was speaking Korean and I understood him. He had a nice, calming voice. I was sad my crush ditched me, even knowing full well I didn't hold his attention and I shouldn't expect him to look for me. But this guys' voice helped. He went to put one hand on my waist and the other holding my right hand to dance, I realized I had my glasses in my right hand and a bottle of wine in my left, Pinot Grigio, opened .. I thought, ""have I been drinking this? And straight from the bottle??"" So, he kind of led me to the counter as he was holding me to dance, and I put the wine down. He cooly turned me to the other side so I could put my glasses down.

And we kept dancing. For a long time. I remember thinking that the song was, in fact, nice.

I was happy to have someone to dance with. And grateful for him. But still actively trying not to think about my unrequited crush on my friend aka fiance in real life. Last thing before I woke up, I started tearing up while dancing and buried my face in the guy's shoulder as we danced.

That was it.

0.0,9jebym,0.0,1.0,"Not sure if this is appropriate here, but I wanted to write about a weird and somewhat disturbing dream I had before I forget.

I was teaching a class outdoors in a narrow U shape. The students were almost in a stone Coliseum-like structure with greenery somewhat covering the seats (in hindsight, the shape and greenery is somewhat similar to a nearby forest). I do not remember specifically what, but I remember my students being antagonistic and berating towards me (likely since I had such an experience with my class earlier that day). The structure of the class was around a large stone-based sewer grate with a rapid current in front of it (similar to a gif I saw not long ago). At some point, either a student told me or I saw that an old friend from years back was smiling as he was about to jump into the rapids in a suicide attempt. I do not remember how he was taken out, but he was on his knees wrapped in a towel in front of me. He was emotional when he mentioned something along the lines of me not caring about him, to which (similar to something I said earlier that day) I assertively said something about being tired of people telling me what I am, followed by me holding onto the sides of his face and saying “I love and respect the fuck out of you.” I was saying something about it being obvious that I cared because I was doing this in front of my insulting students, but at some point the friend turned into a broken plastic Barbie-like doll, with a half-shaved head and a missing lower left leg and pegs and joints exposed. I began to notice that my students were similar dolls (but without missing limbs) and I began to question myself on whether any of my students were really there before I woke up.

I expected it to be some gag or goof, but realized I was wrong once I entered. The interior was that of a soup kitchen in the shittiest part of a ghetto. The only thing on their grills were human heads, one resembling a former classmate of mine. Another had a gaping hole punched into its face. Head still intact, but with a crater for a face. Someone used his head as a bowl. No bone, just red chunks of brain. The comedians told me their initiative, to eat a big chunk of meat, grilled as a tri-tip steak. They even put on their traditional “seasoning” on it. It wasn’t seasoning, it was shit. Human shit. This group’s goal wasn’t to make you laugh, or inspire any emotion. But to remind you of the randomness of existence and how fucked we truly are, or so they say. It sounded like some dumb creepypasta story to me. As I looked into the plate, at what I think was thigh and was positive was shit. I was skeptical, maybe this was a big joke or something? It’d make sense. I was reluctant on taking a bite, but someone on the side told me I only had to eat a 1/16 of it, to be even considered “Nick Swardson” level of funny. I didn’t do it. I couldn’t. I felt sick, distraught to know that something this vulgar could happen, especially in a neighborhood as nice as this one. But maybe the god of my self conscious told me that most things that look pretty on the outside are often not so on the inside. I wanted to leave that awful place. I manage to politely put my plate down and excuse myself to leave. And they let me. No fight, no scrap of any kind. They let me go. They didn’t insult me, or belittle me. They let me go, and didn’t make me swear to secrecy. I leave, feeling somewhat disturbed but relieved as well. I couldn’t tell anyone what happened. I mean, come on. Comedians eating flesh and shit as a brotherhood, and welcoming new “recruits” in the same fashion? Sounds like the dumbest horror/ comedy film in a while. The fact that I couldn’t tell anyone or blame them of harming me was driving me crazy, but something a part of this clicked in my brain. Randomness and non-continuity of life and that some things really don’t matter, and that people take things too seriously. Finally, woke up later in the morning, feeling sick of what I saw in my dream. “What the fuck does that mean?” I told myself.

some background: ex boyfriend, broke up with 2 years ago, totally over him, he is over me, not on bad terms but definitely never speak. the most interaction we have is liking each other's instagram posts.

i remember it from here: i am sitting in a room with two adults, don't remember who or if i knew them, but they didn't feel familiar. on a baby monitor we are watching my ex boyfriend take care of a sleeping baby, the room has no lights on so the image on the monitor is very dark and you can't make out much. the baby starts to cry so my ex picks her up from the crib and when he goes to sit down again his pants RIP in half right down the middle and his huuuuuggeeee dick comes RIGHT OUT lol. and he is peeing??? just a little. he doesn't seem to care at all and just focuses his attention on the baby and comforting the baby/getting the baby back to sleep again. he does nothing at all about his dick or the pee, just leaves it right as it is, unbothered. the two adults (i'm in my late 20s but the adults are much more adult age like 50s) seem very flustered and uncomfortable upon the sight of this, so i walk out and into the room with him to like deal with it you could say. i tell him that his dick is out, etc and and he is like i obviously know, but i don't remember any specifics. time passes and i vaguely remember him taking his huuugeeee fucking dick out and peeing somewhere. then more time passes and i don't remember what happened and then we are outside somewhere, maybe on an outdoor subway platform around a little past sunset, so not quite dark yet but not much light left. we are talking about what happened and i'm expressing concern and almost embarrassment on his behalf and he is almost abrupt with me in the way he used to be when he'd lose his patience with me. never unkind but it's when i could tell it was probably me being a little excessive and i should be a little more calm in my communication. and i'm telling him about how the adults saw and that it is not something people see and are comfortable with, and he is telling me that he doesn't care, he isn't embarrassed, it happened and he couldn't control it/didn't do it on purpose, and what he is really concerned about is the baby. he was looking something up on his phone in regards to the baby. the baby was fine but was having trouble with something and so he was trying to figure out how to resolve that and that seemed to have majority of his attention.

and that is all i remember! all i can say is his dick was quite large and very well defined. like honestly...it looked so good. wow. he has a great dick just in general but of course in real life it is not that huge. bigger than average yes but this was porn big. which i can't say i am necessarily attracted to irl. too big. but i just keep thinking about it. and getting turned on by the whole thing? even though i genuinely don't miss him at all and i don't think about him in my waking life. regardless, we did have a great sex life and i am going through a dry spell right now. but what i really want to understand is the dream as a whole and all of the details.

I went on a trip with someone that felt like my father. And some other random people I can't remember. After leaving a plane that landed on a cold English speaking country we all gathered around a round table. A discussion started about gays, gender and stuff like that and since my father insulted trans ppl I outed myself as trans out of anger ¿? and started to scream some arguments. I started to look at myself in a window and the more I screamed the widder my mouth would get so I stopped because it was huge and bleeding, my father screamed that he didn't want me around so I ran and ran across that huge airport and ended up in a suitcase shop full on snow where I asked for help a lady in her 30s and she guided me to an underground ticket shop where she wanted to buy a taxi ticket for me. There I saw a famous trans male model I thought of as attractive. He was sitting with his legs open, and they were full of oil and really juicy so from an impulse I grabbed one of them for a second, my hand turned warm and blood rose to my brain with warmth. After that he looked at me disgusted and his friends screamed. I tried to perform as if it was an accident but it didn't turn out well. I started running, it felt almost like flying through the underground world. I found a taxi and told the driver just to go straight. But it didn't go as planned, the car toppled over and I went unconscious. Then I woke up in a white bathroom where my breath stopped and I felt on floor with filthy water around me. Then a rat the size of a person started to split my ribs and eat my lungs. YAY. 

Oh yeah then I was able to forcibly wake me up from that and when I did I was hyperventilating with sweat all over my forehead. My entire body felt numb for like 10 mins. And its 5:30 am so I'm tired of typing. Cya.

Here is how most of them go: I would be riding on the public bus or sitting alone somewhere then Kurt would sit next to me and we talk and goof around like we are old friends. Nothing extreme, nothing bizarre, nothing having to do with his death. But here are some of my vivid dreams that make me question if Kurt's spirit was visiting me...​

1. I was attending this large met and greet celebrity convention. I remember watching Kurt perform in a small area of the  building. He wore the same clothes as he did at the MTV Unplugged concert. Once the band finished their song and the audience started to leave, the other band members talked among themselves while Kurt was smoking, appearing bored. I grabbed my bag of groceries and started to leave but Kurt came up to me and asked me to stay. I told him I'd love to but I had to go. A wave of warmth washed over me when Kurt embraced me. This wasn't a nice and loving hug, it was a tight, almost desperate type of hug. I felt that he didn't want to let me go. He said along the lines. ""I hate to see one of my favorite person going through this."" Now I'm not sure why he said this, My best guess is that my mom and I had a heated argument the night before. I returned the hug in the same manner before I left.
2. Kurt appeared beside me while I was grocery shopping and wrapped his arm around my shoulders. The same warmth washed over me as walked and talked through out the store.
3. This is one of the most intense dreams I've had about him. I sat in a pile of leaves on a small hill behind Kurt's house. Two cops existed through a back door, carrying a clear body bag. They carelessly throw the bag on a metal table. My eyes widen when Kurt rose out from the bag and swinged his legs on the ground. He wore sunglasses, his hair was dyed red and wore layers of ripped shirts and ripped jeans. What shocked me most of all was that there was no gun shot wound to his head. I fell back in fear when he floated towards me, but he brushed pass me and into the woods or I believe he was going after the cops.​

I have also experienced dreams where Courtney Love played a role.

1.The most recent, Kurt offered to drive me home. Once we pulled up to my house, Courtney stumped out of my home in a drunken state. I remember spotting a man with dark hair carrying my stuff out of the house.

2. She came up to me with a folder and wanted me to help her with her case because she got arrested.

0.0,99zc61,0.0,1.0,"I had two friends with me who will be referred to as D (16) and M (15) as well as a stranger (age unknown but probably in high school).

A few things about D; she is basically my best friend, she is my age and grade, and she was my crush for a while before I realized we wouldn’t work in a relationship and forced myself to move on. 

A few things about M; I might have a crush on her, and she is 1 grade below me. 

A few things about the stranger; will I don’t know much about personality I know a bit about looks. I’m not sure If I’m tall but I like to think 5’10 is a bit tall, but this guy was taller then me by quite a bit, I’d pin him at 6’2 to 6’5, and like me he was fairly skinny (probably a bit less skinny in comparison to our height difference though) his skin was pale but more tanned then mine, his hair was blonde and his style is the kind I’ve been trying to achieve, but I don’t quite know what to describe it as. The final thing was his accent, he had a distinct English accent (and now I know what to call him so from here on he will be called biscuit).

Sadly there isn’t too much I remember about the actual happenings of the dream but I’ll try my best to tell the tale. So we were doing something which involved us going up stairs with me and D in front and biscuits and M behind us. 

When we get to the to there is a doorway with no door so we enter and we move through the room and for some reason split up, D and biscuits go through a doorway to our right and seem to bond in the short time I see them running to the door. Will this happens me and M start taking and joking around will we search for something.

We then regroup and biscuits and D have news for us, biscuits says he has an opportunity over sees (probably England and that’s why he has the accent) for some business or school; D then says she is going with him. Even in the dream I could feel how hurt I was that she was leaving (and probably jealousy since it’s with a random guy).

The last bit of the dream is after they have left, and it’s simply that me and M have started dating.

I then woke up and just felt weird emotionally (and as I write this in my notes to later post on reddit as u/thesmash2142 I still do)

Now we had walked over to the elevators, and there was a straight up crowd there. So we stood there, pressing the button. The whole time I felt weird, like the floor was crumbling beneath me. My mom and dad both looked annoyed and as soon as the elevators came up I hopped into one, but as soon as I did, the doors started to close. I quickly got back out, but it felt like I was being pulled back in. Not by someone but by gravity. We wait for a bit and it comes back up. This time there’s a notice on the floor. I wish I read it. I hopped back in as soon as I could, and my dad said there was a notice. I was going to read it, when suddenly the walls started to rotate, and we all fell onto the wall on the other side of the elevators. We all rushed to the elevators. This part is foggy but somehow we make it down to some sort of storage area that I had seen someone walk into prior to the gravity shift. There was a man there, working on something. The room was mostly empty, with the walls scattered with object and the middle with only a desk and more things beside it. We introduced ourselves and explained what happened. He let us stay and had an air mattress blown up for us. I lay down as they spoke, and noticed a huge tarantula on the ceiling. I didn’t want to sleep there anymore. I got up and the man called us over and said something about it being the earth itself and not the building. I felt strange, like the earth was crumbling from where I stood. I noticed this was the same feeling I had before. My mom and I (i think) went to go get water and when we came back the spider was gone. I started freaking out and looked for it frantically. Side note I’m an arachnophobe. I asked my mom if she saw it and she said it was on my back, and she removed a fake spider from my back.

In those dreams we're talking normally at my house or some other place I don't recognize and we're always alone no strangers or other people around and then they'll get that really sad look on their faces and sometimes they even start crying. When I ask them what is wrong they just look down and keep saying I am sorry, I am so sorry. They don't ever answer my questions about what is wrong and what they are sorry for. They'll just tell me that they are sorry and that it's not their fault and they don't want to do this. Then they stab me in the stomach on the left side. I always feel the blade entering my stomach. When they do I reach to the spot they stabbed me at and touch their hand and I feel the blood soaking my shirt and I leave my hand there and I look back up at them. Usually they'll be full blown crying at this point. The weirdest part is I never feel afraid or angry I'm just hurt and sad they couldn't tell me what was wrong and why they did this it never bothers me that they're killing me it's always a feeling of being sorry for not being able to help them and sorry they had to do this. It's like I can feel their pain and I am just sad about it. I don't know it's really weird because I have a mark on my stomach on my left side I hadn't really noticed before these dreams started to occur. It's like a lighter patch with a bunch of freckles in it.

So for my example, i know that i'm dreaming and want to wake up (this has happened no more then maybe 4 times in my life) so i decide to look at my right hand since i read that this will wake you up and sure it did for me. But the sight you will see is one to behold.  
At first my fingers are not the same length and im not talking about 1 or 2 cm to long, several joints to long. But as soon as i start looking at them they start to grow and shorten all at once. Very slowly they grow and shrink to half and double their size.   
While this is happening my whole hand is changing color to a putrid dark purple. At this point im panicing, knowing it is a dream did not help me here, still hella scary to see.  
It takes no more then a few seconds before the flesh starts to bubble. Big boils appears under the skin of my hand, but as soon as they pop nothing happens. Its like my hand is a fleshy liquid that retains its shape no matter the gravitational pull of the earth.  
Seeing this whole scenario happening for a few seconds i manage to wake up.

0.0,93p19p,0.0,1.0,"I was in a post-apocalyptic scenario with a group of survivors. There were some kind of mutated zombie things.

Initially we weren’t fighting we were just walking through some area. 

For some reason I separated from them and found some building, there was a black janitor there who was cleaning up and there was this fucking MASSIVE spider. He didn’t seem to care at all and was just pushing it along with his broom saying “go along, go along” to the spider. Creepy.

I said “man that spider is HUGE”, he looked back emotionless, then laughed. The spider then jumped to a wall near me and stayed there. I said “fuck that”. Then went into a bathroom nearby and had a shower. 

The whole place was filthy.

I left the room, and more spiders were in there, so I left the whole building and re-joined my group.

We were walking through a parking lot and then there was this corridor that would lead into a building (seemed like a stadium) Since it is post-apocalyptic there was no power and thus inside the building was dark.

We were about to enter the corridor when a zombie walked out, it was armed with a rifle of some kind so we took cover. 

I have to stress the level of shock I felt at this moment, time seemed to slow down as I looked up and my jaw hit the floor, this zombie was hell buff, holding some rifle and was like 7-8 foot tall with an emotionless expression. I had ran to the corridor and then just before I go in I suddenly stopped and looked up in fear at this beast.

I had an automatic rifle so I took cover behind a car and started shooting. I took it down and then I figured the building had more so we should avoid the building and keep going. 

I dunno if the rest of the people just stayed still as I moved forward and then I noticed two more of these big guy zombies (unarmed this time) come out of a building further ahead. I shot at them but then I turned around and noticed I was surrounded by them. 

This was another moment marked by fear. I was surrounded, every time I looked around me and said “I’m surrounded” they would close in. If I didn’t  get out soon there would be no escape.

I heard the people in my group yell “RUN TO THE WATER” so I did. It was really difficult to find a path through the zombies but I made it to the water. 

We all ran ON TOP of water and ended up on the other side.

I don’t remember what happened after this.

I really enjoy dream journaling. I do it periodically. I'll post one of the dreams from my journal here and if it gets good feedback I might post more. 

The funny thing about dream journaling is you see patterns in your dreams, and as you do it every day it can seem like the dreams are the same but as you read back you see how wildly different they all are.

Also some are hilariously stupid looking back, but I think at the time as I wrote them out I had the vision of the dream in my mind so what I wrote made more sense. Really I should try to flesh things out more in the future.

Really random things like ""Then another dream about a burger."" ""Then somehow I went back in time and had sex with her."" just crack me up because I have no idea what the hell I am referencing.

It seems like this happens when I am trying to write about multiple dreams I remember that morning. 

Anyway, give me some feedback.

0.0,936sd9,2.0,2.0,"So early this morning, I woke up in a cold sweat from a pretty unsettling dream. I’ll try to give it in as vivid detail as possible:

The dream started off I was getting together with some classmates to work on some grad school homework, and I found out one of my classmates is the daughter of a family friend of ours that recently passed away (in real life). However, she looked nothing like she does in real life. 

Anyways, we met to work on this project, and then we decided to go for a walk. It was snowing outside and she decided to slide down a hill on her butt (weird, I know, but bear with me). I ignored her for a bit, and when I looked over, i saw her totally undressed and an older woman I have never seen trying to drug her or something. I went over, beat the piss out of the woman, and told my friend to run for her life. I woke up after that.

Because of this, I woke up freaking out, and I really couldn’t hype myself to walk alone to work today, even though I do it everyday.

I'm a little surprised by myself since I don't often have nightmares that haunt me after waking. I've had some f***ed up dreams, one that comes to mind was of going into hiding from my father, only for him to find us and shoot my mom and drag me along as a hostage with my brother. When I have these dreams, I just wake up normally and I don't find myself disturbed by them or afraid.  The only times I have confided in Reddit about my dreams was during my many instances of sleep paralysis. This dream, however, terrified me to my core and I've been thinking about it ever since I had it. 

I forgot most of the beginning of the dream already, only that I was seeing old classmates at a school and that I was leaving at night time. Something happened to my shirt (I think someone in the street ripped it off me) and I was left shirtless and braless out in the middle of the street. I somehow made my way back to my apartment, probably running to avoid people getting a good look at me. As I was walking towards my apartment building's door, I noticed a man standing by the door, staring at me. I soon recognized him and remembered his name, and that he lived in my building.

This guy doesn't actually live in my apartment building, but the strange thing is, I remember him from my other dreams. He was always in the peripheral, and I somehow recognized that he had moved into the building, but he was always watching me. I think it happened in at least two different dreams, but we never interacted. It felt like he was stalking me through my dreams, not like he was part of my actual dream environment. This was one of the most disturbing aspects of the dream. 

I have an intense fear of being sexually assaulted or attacked, especially while I am alone at night. I felt his eyes go up and down my body and I had the worst feeling of anxiety. I could sense that he was going to do something to me, and I ran as fast as I could into the building. He immediately began chasing me closely, but somehow I lost him between the lobby and the stairs to my floor. I ran into my apartment, where my mom and brother were as usual. I was freaking out, blubbering and screaming about how this man was trying to rape me. 

I put on a shirt, still next to the door, and thought I could hear something. I quieted and I realized someone was slowly walking towards my door. I started screaming and scrambled to lock all the locks. Just as I locked the last one, he slammed into my door, trying to push it open. The locks in the dream were wonky, so I could lock them all and the door would still be open about an inch as though I locked only the  door guard. He was right up against the door and was grinning at me creepily.

I've since forgotten about the specifics, but he would randomly leave and come back for minutes at a time, to remind me he was there. He would purposely sneak up to the door or hit it to scare me, and he was getting of on my heightening terror. All the while, I was hovering by the door, paralyzed. I just remember it was horrible, and that I felt trapped and that no one could help me. My mom wouldn't do anything because she thought it was divine fate that I be raped (I have a lot of conflict with my mom on religion and what she considers the will of god irl). The locks wouldn't work so I had to keep scrambling to keep everything lock, as he would always try to get in just as they were coming undone, cramming his arm into the gap to grab me and pull me out. I woke up when I decided to call 911.

It doesn't sound that terrifying, especially since it was just a dream and this happens to people in real life, but I remember it was the worst I ever felt waking up from a nightmare. It was one of the only times I had to remind myself where I was to ground myself. I had never felt so terrified in a dream since it tapped into one of my worst fears. I couldn't go back to sleep after, and when I told my mom about it, I inadvertently started crying. 

The worst part, I think, was that I could vividly remember his face and name after waking, and for a few hours, until I forgot (chose to forget). It was the first dream ever where someone I made up (I don't remember ever meeting this man), who I could remember so much about as though they were real. Most of my dream people disappear immediately, or when I try to recall their face, they don't have one. My mom said it sounded like a warning, like I remember his face and name because I will meet him one day and he will try to attack me. Pretty interesting. In any case, worst dream I've had that I can remember.

Note: this is lengthy

I dreamt that a female police officer came to our house on what was a lovely night, the sky was oddly beautiful, with the sun almost completely set on one side and the stars showing up on the other side it was like a mix of purple's and orange hues, hard to describe. 

Anyways I was upstairs in my room with my curtains open, sitting on my computer chair just about to get some work done when I noticed a car pull up into our driveway and a particularly attractive female cop stepped out of the car. 

My vision wasn't in complete focus of who stepped out and that it was a police car until like a minute later. 

I drew my curtains and peeked from my upstairs windows, my mother came out of the house and spoke with the lady and I couldn't hear what they were saying but there was a sense of sorrow and seriousness, but she hadn't brought bad news. 

The cop had clearly noticed I was watching her from upstairs window, almost staring at her, I didn't budge or move away I kept staring, and while she spoke to my mom she stared back at me. 

Anyways she left and another male officer came into our house and briefly talked with my mom then my father who came out of his in-house office, he was calm but there was an air of seriousness.

Apparently some items from our house were stolen by someone or went missing and I wasn't told and didn't even realize there had been a robbery, this is because it was so few an unimportant items. 

Anyways the cops had come to tell us that they had found and located the items, the lady cop had told my mom that they had found the items, and the make cop came in and told my mom when they would drop part of it off and where to pick up the rest. 

I came downstairs while the male police officer had just walked in and asked my mother what was going on, upon when she told me some thing had been stolen and the cops had found them. 

There was still an almost abnormal air of peacefulness outside and even in the house, one I haven't felt in years. 

Upon one of the things stolen was my mannequin to which I laughed wondering why someone would steal something so stupid and leave all the electronics untouched. 

It was a strange dream to me, I still remember the cops face although I've never seen her before in real life, I just barely remember the male cops face. The cops were both very attractive people, the female cop stood out to me the most maybe because we dead on stared at each other lol.

I don't normally make that much eye contact with anyone in waking life. Especially not a cop! XD We didn't have anything robbed from our house in waking life, we haven't experienced any house robberies fortunately. 

What struck me about this dream was he sequence, it was so normal. Usually my dreams have this bizarre sequence where I will be in a grocery store then I'm suddenly at a roller rink and then in a pizzaria, no real fluidity or context. 

This dream felt like waking life almost just because it's so idk if fluid is the right word for it.

I did look up what seeing cops in your dreams meant but I feel like there is more to this dream than that, the sequence and fluidity struck me out and I want to know more. I'm going through some big life changes in all aspects of real life myself so idk if that has anything to do with it.

 Full disclosure, I'm female and the staring at the lady cop was nothing sexual of the sort, but it almost felt like I was trying to read or say something to her with my eyes, idk what though, I felt like there was some sort of eye to eye communication though. 

I just feel like there's something this dream is trying to tell me though, since fluid dreams are not that common for me. 

What's my psyche saying? XD

This is the only part I remember 100% but before this 2 of my family members also disappeared and thats why I said why does she also have to be taken.

0.0,90jja5,3.0,3.0,"I have a lot of crazy realistic dreams. Sometimes the things I dream about come true in real life, but it doesn’t happen very often. It might just be coincidence but I can’t shake the feeling that this dream could be me looking into my future.

It started off as a regular dream. I can’t remember much but I know I was at a carnival and I met someone. His name was Maxwell. He said he was on vacation here and he lived in New York. We walked around the carnival for a while and started to really hit it off. At the end of the carnival I got his number and we texted every day since the carnival.

We both had feelings for each other (it was very evident my big sister knew before I even knew) but he was leaving in a few weeks for New York while I lived all the way across the country. So I didn’t tell him and he didn’t tell me. However, we still harmlessly flirted with each other. 

I went to his house one day and met his family. He had a little sister and a younger brother. He led me to his room and we played video games and just hung out. His family greeted me with open arms and I’ve never felt happier. That night when I left, he texted me his feelings to me. He said that even though he will be in New York soon he still wants us to work out bc he couldn’t stop thinking of me. I didn’t know exactly what to say because I felt the same way but I’ve had long distances relationships in the past and they never worked out. But I really wanted to date him. I really wanted to love me and spend the rest of my life with him. So I told him I felt the same way.

We spent the next week constantly hanging out, trying to cram as much time as we could together. But, he did have to go back. And I’ve never cried harder in a dream than the day he had to leave. He drove me a town that was holding carnival. It was three hours away but he wanted to go to because a carnival is where we first met. We walked around and went on rides. I was trying to enjoy the moment but all I could think about how he had to move away. The drive home was awful. We were both tearing up and trying not to sob hysterically while driving down the highway. 

We stayed at my place and just cling to each other. It was the worst pain I’ve ever felt. My chest tightened, my heart was racing, my eyes were stinging from the tears. When I closed my eyes I woke up from the dream in my own bed. I felt so exhausted as if I was actually in that scenario. 

I’ve been thinking about it all day and I can’t shake it off. This dream really shook me to my core. The worst part is is that someone in my life has the name Maxwell but none of the same quality. Dream Maxwell was younger than me and was a guy, while Real Life Maxwell was older and was a girl. (Not that’s a problem bc I swing with both sides). 

I don’t know why I made this post. I think a part of me wanted to vent and another part of me wanted to see if someone matched that description. 

Or maybe I’m just a hopeless romantic. ",hot,I think I met my soulmate in a dream,3.0

For example I just woke up from a dream that I was back in my old high school (graduated 3 years ago) and my teacher left the classroom to grab something. We sit there for probably 30 mins and I notice how eerily quiet it is. I decide to go check on him and when I get into the hallway I see probably 10-15 copies of his body shot and flipped upside down in trash cans at every locker. I want to call for help and try to google my schools office phone number but no matter what I search, I can’t find the number.

0.0,8wd264,2.0,6.0,"So I was around 14 years old when I had this dream. In my dream, I am 20-something years old (which I thought was pretty cool at the time). I found myself standing in what seemed to be a near-destroyed city area, where mother nature seemed to already be in the process of reclaiming the massive concrete buildings humans have built. Explosions were going on around me like an active war zone.

You see, in my dream, the world was in an apocalyptic state and looked like something straight out of those sci-fi video games. It seemed like something was going on because there were many people running in and out of a clearing littered with leftover buildings and debris I was facing and some of the people were wearing uniforms and seemed to be armed with incredibly advanced futuristic high tech weapons/gear. 

The sky was incredibly blue and the landscape was just so beautiful, despite the multiple explosions and death that were happening in front of me. 

I just stood there like an idiot, gaping at the beautiful sky, when some guy also my age in the dream (20 something y/o) grabs me by the arm and drags me to some pit in the ground. 

He yells at me over the deafening explosions for being an idiot and something along those lines. I'm just staring at him in shock, not because of his uniform and high tech gear, but because his eyes were such an unsettling shade of blue like the sky above us right then. 

What? He's handsome and I was a 14 year old girl being yelled at by this man with nice eyes. Gotta appreciate the beauty, you know?

I wasn't really listening to what he was saying until suddenly he stopped talking and just stares at me in shock. Keep in mind, I haven't said a word, so I'm confused as to why he's staring at me that way.

He leans in and pulls me closer simultaneously as an explosion goes off nearby. My hearing does this weird tunnel thing where everything sharpens only on his words as all the other sounds around us become muted.

I never forgot his request, even now several years later. 

""Come find me when you wake up."" 

And then I woke up. I don't remember much of his appearance now, just his scary blue eyes and that he was blonde and attractive. Not very helpful, I know. But I'm sure that if I ever saw those eyes again in real life, I'd know. 

I hope the world doesn't go to shit like that any time soon though.

Where were they taking me? Why? İ didn't have time to think about those things as we were going deeper towards bottom, but the strange thing is that the dark murkiness started clearing up. İ was desperate for air and these two only then noticed that they were drowning me. At this point, İ gave up hope that İ will ever return to the surface. İ was going to die.

Then, they let me go and İ started breathing normally. İ have no idea how İ had not realised it was a dream at that point. So we're walking on the sandy bottom of the ocean towards what looked like to me like a huge rock. İ asked these people why is the water so clear down here and not up there near the surface and they told me that garbage was clutering it up. İ'm pretty sure they weren't talking about physical garbage because İ didn't see any of it in the ocean. After a few minutes we reached the rock and it turned out to be a huge black turtle. The turtle started speaking and said it was one of 4 great ""dragons"" that were fighting some ancient evil. Just as there were 4 of them so were 4 of different enemies, which were some other animas that were evil. lİt said each color represented them in some way but İ don't remember much after that.

After that talk, İ started going back from where İ came from. İ was ascending a wall area that led up to the surface. When İ got into the shadow waters again, İ had a bad feeling like something isn't right. Right at that moment, in the wall forms a gap and a mummy tries to grab me and drag me in but İ evade it. Now İ start falling somehow and fall on a ruined building that wasnt there before. İ couldn't swim which meant İ had to make my way back.

We couldn't find my car, which wound up breaking in half (I don't know), so we had to take a train back to where we live (there isn't a train in real life). Instead of a typical train, the train in the dream was more like those little miner's carts. So we get in behind this very thin, pale, pretty blonde woman. She's young, like in her twenties, so around our age. She's going quite slow, but we're distracted and talking. Something is very wrong. I feel the need to say something to her, to compliment her or acknowledge her in some friendly way, for some reason, but me and my roommate are in depth with our conversation and I brush it off as anxiety. Suddenly, we reach a steep drop off, where the tracks wind around to make the descent less sharp. The cart in front of us stops for a moment. The young woman walks to the edge and jumps straight down. I'm horrified and watch as she lands feet first and her bones break, first in her ankles and then up her legs. Her head hits one of the rails; a piece of shattered skull, that for some reason looks like glass, falls to my feet, with some brain matter still attached. Her mangled and shattered body lies just off the tracks as we pass by. My roommate and I are in shock and call the police, waiting once we reach the stop.

In the middle of the night I was having a dream in which my maternal grandfather who died over a year ago appeared in a car in which my mother was driving and I was in the passenger seat. My mother was very excited to see him. I was aware that I was dreaming, and I truly felt that I was somehow connected to my mother subconsciously in that moment. I was trying to convince her that we were in the dream together and that indeed, my grandfather was also present. However, I felt very uneasy about my grandfather. When I looked at him, he looked sickly, almost rotting. It felt very wrong that he was there with me and my mother. I tried to tell her that we had to leave. I was scared - it felt like something bad was going to happened because somehow I had summoned up my grandfather in a bad way (hence the rotting appearance).

I woke up in a sort of frenzy. When I opened my eyes my vision was obscured by the symbol linked above. It appeared red/orange in a fiery sort of way, and would not go away no matter what I did or where I looked for several seconds. It felt like there was a heavy, smothering presence in my room. I felt very terrified, like somehow I had touched something evil by interacting with my dead grandfather in a forbidden way.

There is a boy playing at his uncle's house. When it's time to go home, he saw a strange store across the street, with some weird things made from wood. Saw nobody in the shop, he decided to check out. Step close to it, when he almost get into the shop, an old man surprisingly appear in front of the store. He was sitting on a wood chair, his back lean on the glass cabinet behind, and drinking tea. But weirder, behind of the old man head, an arm protrudes from the glass cabinet, and it pouring tea for him. Realize the boy, old man smiles and said that what he saw is just a figurative image based on his mind. Somehow, the boy didn't scare at all, even more, he came to visit the old man everyday.

One day, the old man gone, but no-one know. He gone and left a leaf turned yellow on the chair he used to sit. The store still open as usual, and the boy just standing in front of it day by day. Another day, when he still stand there, another strange old man come up. Don't know why, the boy immediately know that the old man just show up is a friend of the weird man in the store. With no reason, he decided to protect this old man, and plant that yellow leaf. Through time, he replace the weird man, take care the store, grow the leaf. 

On other day, when sitting on the chair and driking some tea, the old man walk through with a bike aside. Accidentally, he fallded down. Scared out, he run to the old man and going to help him. But the old man throw his hand aside, and keep moving foward. Worried, he follow the old man. They go through an alley with a lot of pits, get up to a dike where can look out the field where the weird man laying. Aside that field is the garden where he plants the leaf. Standing a long time, the old man go to the garden, look up the tree which had grown up from the leaf. Silencing awhile, the old man turn back, and says thank to the boy, that he had spended all his youth for the leaf, that nobody ever done that before, and make friend with the weird man. And now, he is free. Hear that, the boy suprisingly weep. His feel turned into a mess. What is the meaning of all of it. He doesn'  get it. Happy? Sad? He vonlunteered it, but why it make him feel like a responsibility? Is he happy for escape, or sad for lose something? He doesn't know, tears still fall.

0.0,8mw60w,1.0,1.0,"I thought I post this here for input, since someone had created an interesting thread on /r/askreddit. I'm wondering if anyone can make any sense of this, and if anyone would like, I could tell of more dreams pertaining to these locations. 

At one point, many of my dreams seemed to all reference this city, filled with concrete and skyscrapers. One dream was of me trying to ascend one of these buildings to the roof, where another structure, like a mix between a house and a small office, had been built upon the skyscraper.

For whatever reason, the closer I got to the top, the heavier I felt and the more congested the escalators became. Yet, amongst all of it, everything felt natural and familiar. I didn't reach the top, but I saw it from an aerial view and just seeing it like that was astonishing. Even now, that dream is extremely vivid.

Another dream revolves around a small town that my grandfather lives in. The dream version of this town, has little in common with the actual town, as the actual town is aging and declining, but what's interesting, is that like the city, I've had a series of dreams revolving around it, except that the dreams also span a large window of time.

One dream simply involved me picking up my kids (I don't have any in the real world, but I did in this dream) from a school that is now closed, while seeing people who, in my dream, were familiar to me, but in the real world, are completely unknown. They looked like they were struggling and I felt a sense of failure coming off of them.

Another dream revolved around being in the house of people who felt familiar, but again, have no real world analogs. They were nice, and it must have been fall or winter, because they had the fire place going, and everyone was dressed for the season, with blankets and a somber glow present in their house.

And finally, and probably the most disturbing so far, was a dream that took place in the town, but what seemed like decades later. Something happened, because I found myself at my grandfathers only to see a decomposed skeleton in an older looking car, with no sign of life around. There was a wind and a somber tone of death, and at that point, I could tell something was wrong, but I didn't know for sure what it was.

Edit: Thought I'd share one more about the city, as this dream was the most disturbing from that series. 

Several years ago, when I was in college, I dreamt that I was standing in some drainage area. I was surrounded by concrete and for some reason, this was a popular gathering place for a lot of younger people. In this dream, I was not myself, but somebody entirely else - a thin man, in his 20s with blonde hair. While walking around, the sound of gunshots began to echo throughout the area as people began running. Around me, people were falling left and right, and what was once concrete became dirt and trees as I found myself running in a woods, with the few others who were trying to escape as well. In the distance, a cabin appeared and I remember running into it with several people. However, upon running into it, and down a flight of steps that looked like they went to a cellar, we were met with a locked door that was painted bright red, with nowhere to go. The dream ended there and I woke up breathing heavy and filled with fear. ",hot,A Series of Dreams Involving Two Locations,1.0

Kinda just wanted to put this somewhere where people wouldn’t call me crazy lol . 

So I normally don’t dream , idk why , I had a bunch of really intense nightmares when I was a teenager that would keep me up for literally days and days , and then all of a sudden I just stopped . 

Now I only dream when there’s a message in it , if that makes sense ? I had weird dreams before my parents split up , right before the election, before my brother announced he was enlisting , before my co worker was in a really bad car wreck , I dreamed about several partners before I met them etc etc . It’s weird . I always have this moment where something happens and I’m like “ man , that’s where that dream came from .” 

Every so often I have this really weird , really vivid dream . It’s the same people in the same setting, almost like another life but it always ends the same , the same things happen . I don’t know how to stress how real it feels . 

It takes place over I would guess 2.5 or 3 years . In the dream I have kids , the youngest is 2, and I’m pregnant with her when everything starts but just starting to show . 
 I’m always living with this man that I don’t know in real life and we’re very happily married with three kids. There’s been some sort of national change like a war , or a depression , something like that , and us , my mother and a man she’s happy with that ive never seen , my brother and a woman he’s happy with that I’ve never seen , and some friends I’ve never seen are all living on this property I own in real life . There’s the main house - which burnt down at the beginning of the year in real life - and  For some reason I have the properties on either side of us , where the rest of them have dispersed. It’s like a commune type deal over about 4 acres. For some reason , there’s something about my myself , husband , and kids that is this HUGE secret . I’m not really sure what it is , but it’s a big enough deal to scare me , which is hard to do . We aren’t really in hiding or anything, but there are several instances where we have to tell our kids not to say things in public that would give us away , or where my husband and I talk about how hard it is living this way.  My brother comes home one day , and tells me there’s some weird stuff going on in main town , some people are talking , and to hang out at the house for the day instead of going out with his girlfriend and another friend of ours to talk to the farm up the road about a trade . (It’s a pretty rural community and this isn’t really out of the norm , even in real life. It’s very much like a ive got peppers you’ve got eggs community .). I’m like cool, cuz I trust him and if he says there’s some weird stuff going down , it’s best for me and my kids to stay home and on the safe side . I’m taking care of some house things and my mom comes in with a bunch of stuff from the garden and tells me there’s something wrong with one of the plants , could I go look at it . Sure no problem , let me take the kids with me , this is a great teaching moment . I go out and these authoritative type people are out there that SCARE . ME . SILLY . Like I have this feeling of utter and total fear and betrayal , because whatever the secret is , obviously my mom and brother have ratted us out . Some graphic stuff happens that I’ll leave out , and they end up burning my husband , my three kids ( LITTLE kids , like 2,5,and 7) and me alive at the stake , Salem style , and the whole family just watches . My mom and brother are like stone faced , and everyone else is like there’s nothing we can do to help you now . The douches killing us are like you knew better and you did it anyway , this could have all been avoided . No one ever actually says what it is that we did , but in the dream I have this feeling like how long did I think I could we could do this . 

It’s the same every time , but last night it changed and I can’t figure out why . 

The first change was my aunt and uncle came to stay with us . My husband comes in and tells me he thinks he should move them in , cuz the area they’re in has been getting worse . Another one of my aunts also comes to visit us, and she even says it’s been a long time since she saw us . It doesn’t seem like she knows my youngest kid , and the other two don’t respond to her the way they do other family and friends  that they see all the time . 
 The second change comes when I go outside and see my kids playing , the same as always , but this time there’s this weird sound we all hear , like a tornado siren , and it makes them laugh ? Like we all think it’s hilarious , and the oldest tells my brother “ I remember when I used to be scared of that” .
The next change comes when my brother tells me not to go out . This time my aunts tell me that I should be careful , because they have a bad feeling about today . My husband walks in and we talk about moving to Louisiana ( I’ve been in love with Louisiana since I was a kid in real life ) , and he tells me he got some land down there and he’s gonna go finalize everything next week . We seem really excited about it , like it’s gonna be a really great opportunity for us . We talk about getting everything packed , how we’re gonna facilitate the move , if we’re gonna try to take any of the plants or just leave them , logistic stuff . We’re both acting like getting out of the area is gonna be a relief to us . While we’re having this conversation , my two front crowns fall out of my mouth into my hand  , and I get this feeling of dread , like it was a sign of something bad . I put them back in ( cuz apparently I’m good like that ) and go about my day , but the feeling never really goes away . I kinda feel like I’m looking over my shoulder . 

Everything else plays out exactly the same , except this time I woke up before we got burned . 

I don’t know why I’ve had this dream so vividly so many times , and I don’t know why it’s been exactly the same until now . I started having it about three years ago , but I’ve had it more and more frequently the last three months or so . It’s so vivid that I wake up in tears genuinely confused about where I am and where my kids are . I can’t think of anything I could do that would prompt my brother to snitch on me to that degree , or what could be going on that people would be hunting kids that small .

But then suddenly I stopped because a baby started crying. I looked straight at a crib that used to be empty but now had a baby. And suddenly I saw us as a married couple in our thirties all happy, the party was gone and we were still in the room. Which was weirdly dark, only had lighting near the crib. Then I just got like a shock and started panicking. I ran out of the room and roght outside of the room were a bunch of people. They were all the same person, the little baby girl in the crib, but at different ages. One was around 7 the other older than 50, a teenager, and onother baby. They were all telling me to take care of them. I ran out the house and there was this truck driver waiting for me telling me to get out before the other guy does. I get in the truck and look back at the house. My “husband” was standing at the door just staring at me. But he didn’t have an arm and half of his face was like melting. Idk how to explain it was drooping like it was being pulled down by gravity. In the truck there was a woman and she was also afraid. The rest of the neighborhood was super peaceful and sunny, like nothing was wrong. Then the truck driver collapsed and fainted. I started driving the truck with the woman trying to help me.

So we're just driving around and suddenly see T's car. T starts shooting at us, and J starts shooting back. No clue where J got a gun. I duck down to avoid getting hit. I'm screaming at J to stop because it's not worth going to jail but J says it is.

Suddenly I'm seeing J come out of this dinky cell (this place has been in my dreams before) and go over to this stage thing for trial. Everyone lines up including the ""friend"" T. I go stand behind J and whisper to say that T sexually assaulted me, not that T gave me a hickey and that J was mad.

I used to have the problem of not being able to run in my dreams every so often, but now it happens in every dream and I wake up exhausted from trying to escape from whatever horrific circumstances I'm in. It's not necessarily frightening all the time, but as someone who avoids horror movies like the plague because she knows she'll freak out if she does, I am forced to constantly live through disturbing, violent imagery and moments, and I always wake up disoriented and stressed out.

0.0,8htbc8,2.0,1.0,"Hello fellow reddit users. 

To this day, i have vivid memories from a time I am not supposed to remember. These memories, or dreams, I am still not sure, go back to when I was probably 2 or 3 years old. During this time, I was an only child and my parents and I were living in a house that they built. They always told me that I was too young to remember this place, being born there and because we moved out when I was around the age of 3 years old. Despite this, something about that place haunts me to this day.

I can vividly remember, waking up in that house to, what I will call a doll, sitting in the corner of my room almost every night. I say doll because I don't really know how else to describe it. This doll was probably about 4ft tall and sat in the corner of my room. It was yellow skinned, similar to the Simpsons. It seemed like a stuffed animal, with a bright red nose. It was also wearing a white and blue, vertically striped shirt. I don't remember being scared of this thing when I was younger, but to this day, I am now 21 years old, I remember this creepy looking doll/Simpsons looking thing vividly and clearly. I have asked my parents if they had ever purchased something like that for me when I was younger and set it in the corner of my room, and their response was always ""I have no idea what you are talking about."" 

I am just looking for opinions from fellow reddit users that may be able to tell me if this was a weird, reoccurring dream I am somehow able to remember from my childhood, or if this may be something paranormal that has stuck with me throughout my life.

I'm typically able to distinguish between reality and dreams even in a paralysis type state of me being chocked (this has happened once) but for whatever reason this dream felt real. I was literally spectating myself like a stalker. I registered that it was a dream when I first saw myself but the longer the dream went on the more and more I felt like it was reality and I didn't want to leave. I was woken up by a noise in my room (nothing crazy pretty sure it was my pet that made the noise) and I immediately wanted to go back into that dream completely ignoring the fact that it could very well lead to a paralysis episode. I had zero fucks to give I was ready to ditch everything to go back to that dream, and I did. When I fell back asleep time passed in dream just like reality (if that makes sense) I caught up to myself and started watching again like a spectator. I woke up maybe twice more and the same thing happened where time passed in the dream and I had to catch up with myself. I just watched myself like a creeper enjoying this new life. I became so envious of this reality that when I woke up and was unable to fall back asleep I contemplated for what seemed like an eternity whether or not I should go to the store and buy a bunch of tylonal pm pills and try to artificially enter that sleep state again. A couple days have passed since that dream and since I've slept and that's honestly the only thing that's been on my mind. I honestly don't know if this is my minds way to call out for help or what but I figured I should post this and see what others think about my ""predicament"". Feel free to ask any questions and stuff that may help with the psychology of this. ",hot,Desire,3.0

\~ 9:00 I took half a tablesppon of Kratom, Red Vein

Normally at any given point in time I see two eyes behind my vision in a blurry dotted fashion placed approximatley where my eyes are placed behind my vision. These eyes dissapear as when you watch a television show the surrounding scenerey dissappears, but by focusing on them I can bring them back at any point in time. I can always see them more clearly when I shut my eyes as normally they are looking back at me which leads me to the conclusion that they exist in the back of my mind. I feel as if there is an association between these eyes and my ability to see faces in objects and patterns. As if the eye that I project ontu said image is in fact a distortion of these same eyes. 

I jot down the point of taking Kraton for at this moment in time I cannot visualise these eyes. I also stayed up all night last night and slept 4, then 4 more hours throughout the day. Overall I feel mentally and physically stagnant, not tired or drained, simply without the desire to achieve anything. 

I do not beleive that these eyes have a given feeling associated with them, they are simply a visual phenomina.

What I percieve when I close my eyes instead is these eyes closing.  This visual faded away from my mind quickly and now the onlt thing i percieve is a downwards drain. It does no spiral but folds inwards with the point of stretching occuring somewhere near my jaw, falling down my throat, and dissappearing into a seam vertically in line with my chest. Again there is no physical or mental feeling associated with this visual, it simply seems to be the color of the canvas I act upon. It appears a bluish grey if I was to give it a color, with no variance of color. This image does not feel tied to the associated physical counterparts but seems to exist in relation to itself in space with the same form of accordance; it does not hover nor float but has a form of depth to it.

10:22 The Kratom's effects are apparent and I have entered a more sedative state inhibiting my ability to visualise or focus much of anything. 

Tonight I will focus on what my current active mental shape is so that I may have a reference point for any hallucinations I have from this point on.

Dream: I was in a bedroom with my friend Gabriel and a cute girl Iknow named Maria. I felt as if I had been inside this particular deam before although I don't actually remember it awake. Because inside the dream I had dreamed this dream before I knew what was going to happen. Two men working for Salamonca \(Breaking Bad\) Were going to come inside the house and kill someone else in the main lobby of the house. The bedroom door is open allowing one to see the front door to the house. I motioned for Gabe to hide behind a bed and I positioned Maria with myself in a corner adjacent to an armoire. I told her to be quiet and that she couldn't make any noise. The two men could be heard entering the house and although no noise could be heard, there was a flash of light and Maria's expression went to being horrified. She also made no noise but I lucidly covered her mouth as an extra step of protection. The two men left. I then clumsily moved around the bedroom.

The next thing I know Im riding in the backseat of a black car with Salamonca. He has a dissapointed look on his face. I tell him that I have good news and he burst out Tuco? In this situation it felt like he wanted Tuco dead. I told him no, but that I would have him very soon. His face went back to an outlook of dissapointment and he told me to get out of the car and that I had to walk home. As I walk home every other couple of steps I have to use my hands and feet isntead of just feet to walk as walking is very hard. The dream ended just before I turned around a corner of the street.

4/18	10:50	 Thoughts: I first began smoking pot to ease mental strain from failure to understand myself and reality. Perhaps during the several years of sedation this has caramalized into something that scales with the power of my mind over time. Now that I have taken a brief rest from marijuanna it has rekindled and I am more aware of it rather than covering up and repressing it. In my most current state, I am better equipped to deal and learn and grow upon these experiances in every way, perhaps even coming to terms with, and becoming a more perfected whole ""me"".

Dream: In this dream I'm sitting in my room gaming playing an online Halo\-esquestyle game. Similar to Planetside 2. The map was a desert style canyon of a map which had an extreme variance in Z\-elevation. I was doing relatively well. There was alot of vehicle warfare intermingled with infantry and my character was specced to be the ebst of both worlds. After I got killed and while waiting to respawn I pick up a bong which I assign as my bong although I do not own one. I pack the bowl to the rim with a hasheesh like material which I recognize inside my dream as DMT. I have not yet taken DMT in real life but in the dream I lit and smoked the entire bowl in one hit. It is currently dark in my room inside my dream with the only light source being my laptop screen and the red hot bowl but my eyes have adjusted so I can see quite well. After taking the bong rip the experiance can be best described as 6 tibettan bowls aligned in a 2x3 column slowly yet quickly emerged from the back of my mind and overlayed the back of my entire sight. The ringing of these bowls compounded extremely quickly and caused my entire body to vibrate immensley. I cannot even remember the entirety of the feeling brought on by smoking the DMT only that is was so intense to the point it was very uncomfortable. My entire being shook in place and there was alot of mental activity going on that I cannot even remember. Everything developed a color to it similar to that of THC oil, a golden brown, or the same color as when you rub your eyes too hard. I vibrated so hard that the lines that held together my being shook apart. I had the ability to hit the bong again but decided not to firmly. I remember shortly afterwards a snippet of playing Mario Kart on a space map and I beleive that I was still high during this. 

The next part of the trip involved taking a road trip with friends to somewhere. The road was extremely flat and had a cracked clay like soil on both sides of this highway. We had been driving all day on the highway and decided to stop for the day. Next we were all inside of my shower. The shower was on but the did not seem to affect anyone. My shower head has LEDs inside of it and there was a bright blue light emitting from the shower head which reflected throughout the shower because although the water didn't seem to affect us, it still wet the inside of the shower. My shower has stucco walls and ceiling giving a very cave\-like feeling. My friends Eathan, Martin, and Saivarias were inside the shower with me while my friends Dalton and one other were outside the shower just outside the doorway. Everyone is standing and we are all smoking pot, either out of a pipe or blunts I'm not sure as my attention is focused to Eathan. I'm standing in the middle of the shower directly underneath where the stream of water is falling down but at this point in time I don't even vissually notice it. Martin and Psy are currently hitting the pipe to my right and Eathan is too my left holding the bong. I warn Eathan that what is inside the bong is not weed but DMT. He decides to hit it or at least at some point in the near past he had hit it because once he realised what was inside the bong he simply put the bong down not in fear, but out of respect for the pure raw power of the substance. He put the bong on the cabinet outside of the shower. I can tell that he and I are somewhat still under the influence of a recent hit of DMT but we cheif down on pot with the others.

After that I'm watching a youtuber known as Physix Girl playing a video game. The game is 3d and appears based on Star Wars. We are watching a death cam of the final moments before her last character died. All I see is the game as if playing it in VR although at the bottom right I can see Physix Girl cropped ontu the screen, she is narrating with another male costar who has a voice and body type of Will Weaton but I am unsure as although I cannot see him on screen he has a feeling of a black blurred being. The game itseelf is in 1st person point of veiw. This particular character of Physix girl is very high leveled and very late game. She begins walking us through what happened talking back and forth with the cohostwhos voice does not sound distorted but rather similar to that of Will Weatons voice. It begins inside of a bathroom. She walks up to a sith style character next to the urinals and takes him down with a vertical slash of a lightsaber. In this game time only moves when you move allowing for almost turn based combat. To the right a door opens and another Sith member walks in. Physix Girl's lightsaber is bright yellow and she blocks a vertical attack with a horizontal parry then ripostes killing the next enemy. Through the door she can see a dry dusty 6 ft. stretch of dirt then another door. She has a spell called open/close which is supposed to teleport her to a door and open/close it. The door she is trying to use it on is closed but for whatever reason the spell won't work due to a bug in the targetting. This gives enough time for the next enemy to walk in which is a Dementor. She does not have the capability to fight such a creature in such close quarters so she turns around and runs. Her character is also quite low on life. The character gets hung on the bathroom stalls a little allowing the dementor to gain ground but she makes it to the other door in the bathroom. It takes several attempts to open the door leading the dementor to hit her 3 times. The attacks deal damage and drain Constitution over time causing her to lose even more life as she runs outside the room. She heads left towards a canyon and turns around running backwards to wacth the dementor follow her outside the bathroom. The entire terrain is once again desert dry with a great variance in z\-levels altohough this spot that grounds only two buildings is reletivley flat. I hear Will said well you almost survived and something along the lines of it was possible with RNG to survive the 3 Dementor hits. She jumps backwards off the cliff and her character dies from the fall damage which kills her from the massive consitution drain. Now we are watching what would of happened if somehow her character had barely survived. Her life is \-1 and were watching a blue wisp type avatar of her character in 3rd person. The dementor stops at the top of the cliff either not able to fall off thet edge or not concerned with a already dead character. The avatar runs down the ravine and cuts right up an incline going back up to relatively the same level as the buildings. A storm circle similar to that of Fortnite shrinks past her killing the spirit form of her character and both hosts give out an aww. She then shows off a character designed to backflip so powerfully it backflips near bout off the map. Then I wake at \~ 3:00. I will not go back to sleep for the DMT experiance has me somwhat shook mostly because I cannot remember nor comprehend the entire initial experiance. At the time I chose not to hit it anymore I remembered a video stating that to achieve that breakthrough experiance you needed somewhere around 4 tokes, but I was good with just the one.

I'm having a weird kind of dream and I have it so often that I started drinking again with hopes of just blacking out. I only have it when I sleep on my stomach, not even if I go to sleep on my stomach, I just always wake up on my stomach. It isn't even that serious, I guess, but here goes.


I open my eyes but see nothing but my couch and it looks faded and washed out, all the colors are off. I can look around and I feel like I can move around but what I see is always just the arm of my couch and a bit of my wall no matter how far I feel like I've moved, if that makes sense.


 Then someone starts talking to me, sometimes it is complete non-sense. The voices change often in different dreams but it is always this scenerio. There is one voice that is clearly my voice but every fiber of my being says it isn't me, pins and needles type deal. It always tells me how useless I am without it and how lucky I am I get to spend time with it. It will mock me for wanting to visit it like I chose to have the dream and ask me why I keep coming back there, that I must crave the attention and tells me it may just keep me there next time, every single time. 



There is one that just laughs at me, he is always alone and always laughing. 



Sometimes there is a voice I assume is a woman's that is soothing like a hot bath but she says the most terrifying things she can think of and is very threatening towards me bit has never hurt me, obviously it is a dream of course. 



Sometimes there is a chorus of voices, jumbled to being a buzz in my ear to the point that they feel like they are trying to bore a hole in my head by talking at it. 


It is always different but very same feeling. It always ends with my voice saying ""we are nothing, we are none, infinite, infinte, infinite, none"" over and over and over and suddenly I'm looking in a mirror in a dark room but I see my reflection and there is light from the mirror. I'm just saying that and moving it's head in an infinity sign motion repeatedly. The amount of times I (I guess but I'm still not sold that I'm actually saying it because again, my lips aren't moving and I KNOW FOR A FACT I'm not saying It but I swear to god it has to be me)  I feel like it is my actual voice, not the fake me voice, but I'm not moving my lips or trying to say it. Then the voice(s) go quiet, I wake up, usually sweating, sometimes crying and I feel an overwhelming sense of doom that I can't shrug off for hours.

0.0,8b9acc,1.0,1.0,"The first thing I remember from the dream is that I was playing Crash Nitro Kart. When I finished the run I felt that it was too late since on that dream it was night time and something inside me told me it was 4 AM. For some strange reason I decided to go upstair for talking with my brother (whom I never talk). As soon as I reached his room, I hit the wall with my left hand for turning on the light. This woke up my brother. By the way, his bed sheets where white.
Where’s mom? - I asked him.
She went to sleep to one of the benches of the park. - He told me.
Inside the dream I found this reasonable since her bed didn’t have any mattress. Fastly I went down the stairs  and I headed to the kitchen. Instead of arriving to the kitchen, I appeared on the park. On this park there were 4 benches, one at the east, another at the northeast, other at the south and southwest. My mom was on the northest one. I don’t remember exactly what did I tell to my mom, but her answer was as follows:
If you want to use the computer, it’s on that bench. - She said while pointing to the bench. 
Walking slowly I sat on the bench where the notebook was.

I left the notebook on my legs and I started to browse youtube on it. Then I clicked on a video. The video was called “The simpsons Steamed Hams” but everytime the characters on the video finished saying a sentence, a magic symbol appears. 
I didn’t finish watching the whole video, but after seeing the symbol I started to feel bad. I found myself dizzy, as much as I started viewing circular waves imitating the shoot waves from the boss Thieft on the game Ratchet and Clank 2. His attack consists on throwing a rock to the ground, causing a wave to appear which normally you have to jump.
I started to feel uneasy. I placed my 2 hands on my face (I usually do that when I’m on a shock) and I left the bench. I started feeling even more dizzy with strong fear. I was feeling really bad. I decided to go to talk with my mom again:

I don’t feel good, mom.
Then, my mom got up from the bench and said: 
Let’s go home
While we were going down the road, I was still feeling a bit uneasy since my eyes detected a guy with a Skate. The skate was totally black and the boy had a orange t-shirt, green eyes and almost yellow skin with frickles. He was going down the road while watching carefully to me. This made my dread to increase just for watching at the boy.
Did you saw him? - I told to my mother.
Him? Who? - She answered me.
THE BOY! - I yelled at her.
I don’t see any boy - The finally told me.
In that moment, I felt that the symbol that I saw during the Steamed Hams video was making me see hallucinations. The boy kept going down the slope at an incredible slow speed, until our sights met. As soon as our eyes met, I felt an incredible anxious fear… and then I woke up.

0.0,887ka8,3.0,3.0,"Recently I had three disturbing dreams that all seemed to be connected to each other. I hope someone might be able to help me figure out what might be causing this, or the meaning of the dreams. 

The first dream was relatively short. I traveled to a house which was labeled as the house of someone I care very much about (I will call them N because they appear a lot).  I decided to take the doorknob off of the front door and take it back home with me. As I walked back down my street to my house, a large grizzly bear was standing in the middle of the road. I did not seem to bothered by the bear, but the bear ran up to me, and attacked me. It grabbed me with its mouth and tossed me high up in the air. I woke up at this point, startled, and a with slight pain in my chest.

The second dream was more complex. I am a teen, and in school still. I was walking through the school building to my locker. The school was empty and silent. As I was grabbing something out of my locker, I heard a dripping noise. I shut my locker and looked around and saw a locker nearby, blood dripping out of it. Throughout the dream, I was calm. I opened up the locker to see N sitting inside, dead, with his head cut off. I grabbed his head and started to hug it, yelling for someone to help him, yet no one was there. One of my teachers slowly approached me, hand covered in blood.They warned me, ""This is what will happen if you get too close to him."". I had the intuition that this was not my teacher, but something else. I asked them what they were and why they did this to him, and it only laughed back at me. I woke up startled and shaken.

The third dream was yesterday, and was very long and complex. I was in a building out in the middle of the woods which had security cameras all over the building which I could look at though use of my phone. My dream up until a certain point was pretty normal, walking around, talking to employees/residents, hanging out with N, etc. At some point, I noticed that some objects one of the people had taken out for us to use were missing (some costumes?).  I checked out the camera and saw a person loading them into a car outside. The building had a small parking lot, and the only way to get outside would be by means of large garage doors (for some reason). I went out and saw it was my mother, who said she was taking them somewhere to be cleaned. I went back inside, and the dream shifted  to the view of two small children and their dog. I don't remember this part well, but I think that the kids decided they wanted to see how fast my mom could stop her car.So as my mom drove back she hit the children and killed the dog, which caused her to leave the car it running, because she ran into the building for help. The kids, who also had been hit by the car, were missing some of their limbs, and in a twisted sort of revenge, decided to drive the car straight through the front entrance. The kids rammed straight through, setting off alarms everywhere, but also crushing the car and killing the children inside. I helped to usher everyone I could into a room during the ""lockdown"". When I decided to check the cameras, I noticed N was inside a different room nearby, and when I checked the surrounding cameras, the same bear was standing outside the room. My mom was watching the camera behind me and pointed at a open door behind the bear, saying ""Isn't that the room we're in?"".  I realized the door was open, but I also had to save N, so I ran out side and slammed the door. The bear turned round and ran towards me. I woke up.

After I woke up, I really wanted to try to continue the dream, so I fell back asleep. The dream was now partially lucid, due to the fact that I knew that I knew I could not truly be hurt by the bear. I resumed moments before it ended, with the bear running at me. I ran back at it and wrestled the bear to the best of my ability. It ran off, but not before slashing my forearm. I got N to open up the door, and we ran away from the bear, into a large gym, similar to my schools gym.  N was carrying me, and they put me down, when I heard ""Stop that! You're ruining it! You've ruined everything!"" I turned around to see a strange creature, which is hard to describe. The creature had a floating white pyramid for a head, a floating navy oval shape for a body, various nuts, screws, and unperceiveable blobs floating where the arms should be. It had to floating hands, both white and cartoony in shape. It floated towards me and reached towards my head, saying thing like ""You weren't supposed to do that!"" and ""You've ruined it!"". During this, I was frozen in place, and when it grabbed my head, I woke up. 

I don't have any clue what this all means, but I am CONVINCED that the bear in the dream was the same one as before and the strange entity I saw yesterday was the one ""possessing"" my teacher in the dream. Please, any help would be greatly appreciated. ",hot,3 Disturbing Dreams that all seem linked somehow (do not read if easily disturbed),3.0
0.0,87rldm,0.0,3.0,"Hey guys, I'd like the share my dream I had 2 nights ago to see if anyone of you can help me figure out what does it mean. 

I had 3 parts in my dream. I'll skip part 1 & 2 as it is irrelevant and go straight away to part 3. 

In real life, I know this guy (I'll name him Alex here). Alex & I (I'm a female) met in law school. He is a year older than me. Throughout our years in law school, our friendship was somewhat ok. He calls me bro. We were more like bros instead of friend. He recently went through a bad break up & are taking medications. I haven't seen him in months because after graduating, we live in different states but we text once a while. 

In my dreams, I wanted to go to an old town to look for a bangle. Suddenly saw Alex's posting in Instagram. He posted being at a corner near fast-food restaurant that I recognized. Coincidently, I was passing by there so I parked and texted him ""Where are you?"". I saw him in front of me but I pretended I didn't. I noticed he saw me too but didn't react immediately. He was wearing a suit. Full suit. Not sure with tie or not. But he was in black & white, after court stuff (he is a chambering student). 

When I saw him, I quickly faced my back to him & looked at the main road.  He noticed I was there & he pretended to pass & stand in front of me. He was replying a text to me. He honestly looked like he was touched to see me. He just couldn't believe I was there. Like as if I came at the right moment, the right time. Like as if in his heart, he knew I would come (thinking she is the one). He took a moment to digest everything. I was there covering half my face like burkha but smiling inside when I saw him.

Suddenly he kneel down on one knee. In public area, where everyone was watching. It started to drizzle abit. I was in shock. A friend of his came (our mutual friend in real life) with an umbrella to protect him. I was asking him are you serious? I turn to her and ask is he serious? She said yes too. She told me, you came at the right timing.

He removed a ring box, took out the ring & asked, will you marry me? I couldn't breath. I said yes and he just immediately puts the ring on my finger. He gave me the biggest hug I have ever received from anyone. We hugged for sometime. In public, infront of everyone we hugged it out. He starting saying things like you came the right time. I (Alex) just needed that. You came the right time & this is the right thing to do. He tried singing some song. It was like a moment that made him sure what he wants. He wanted me. After that I told him I was too happy with the proposal & hug that I forgot some of my relations might have caught us doing that. He just smile. 

Then we sat at a nearby pipe bench. I was on the left side, he was on right side. So many things was going through my mind. I saw the ring again. I went from don't-want-to-be-married to I-can't-wait-to-marry-him. I also thought that, you know, what if this was a temporary thing? So many thoughts at one time, I had to calm down. 

I took my right hand and hold his left hand. Asked him did he had dinner yey? He said he had his dinner already. I replied yeap I had dinner already too. Again he starting saying things like he want to protect me. Started singing umbrella by rihanna. He kept saying you can stand under my umbrella. He had tears in his eyes. He tried to use the hand I held him to wipe his tears but it hit his specs. I took my finger & wipes his eyes. 

In between this whole moment I was starring at the ring. Adjusting it here & there. It was slightly bigger. At the end I told him, the ring is big. We just smile & laughed about it. 

Then, I woke up.

0.0,84t6uf,0.0,3.0,"(after staying awake 28 hours, I took a two hour nap and had a weird and vivid dream)

I am sitting on the edge of a pew, in far back right of a ramshackle shed.  Two rows of four pews filled the building, each one filled shoulder to shoulder with men and women dressed in pale red robes.  At the front of the shack, an altar was set up.  Upon the altar sat the skull of a deer, its horns cracked and twisted the wrong direction and its surface still slick with blood.  It looked freshly killed.  Stepping out from the shadows, a tall man dressed in a white suit raised a hand to collect the attention of the audience then delivered a sermon, his voice bouncing off the splintered wooden walls of the shed.  I don't remember all of it, he spoke at length and much of it was a haze of nonsense.  One part I do remember was ""Those who come to us hungry, we shall feed.  Those who come tired, we shall rest.  Those who come ignorant, we shall learn.""  While he was talking, he would occasionally rub the palm of his free hand against the top of the skull.  The blood would shift and slide as he touched it, but it would not stain his hand.

At the completion of his sermon the man drops both his hands to his sides and encourages his congregation to think about what they've learned.  All but one of the congregation rise up and proceed to walk out the door.  The one who doesn't leave walks up to the altar, tells the deliverer of the sermon that she/he (can't remember the gender, not sure whether or not I knew during the dream) has learned, and leans over the dear skull.  They slash their own throat on one of the antlers, their flesh tearing like paper as they wiggled their neck back and forth.  They then stand up like nothing had happened and walk out the door like the rest of them, unbothered by the gaping wound in their neck.   Looking down, I have a notebook and a voice recording device in my hands (While I was dreaming I knew what the recorder was but now that I'm awake it just looked like a grey and blue brick the size of a calculator.  No buttons or controls of any kind.)  I make a final note and close the notebook, then stuff it into my pocket and stepped outside.

While the inside of the shed was surprisingly well lit, the outside was dark and clammy.  The grass and the trees were pitch back, only visible through a thin white outline of snow.  I know I am on a hill, but I can't see how steep the incline is.  While there were at least a dozen people who left the church I count only two sets of footprints.  I tell myself to make a note of that later.  I don't know where I'm going.

After this, the dream basically falls apart into a series of vague noises and incoherent images.  But that part was really clear.  It was also weirdly... neutral.  I didn't feel scared or alarmed the entire time, I was just sort of like ""Huh.  This is happening."" and it was only after I woke up that I realized ""That was some Dario Argento shit.""",hot,(Dream)- Observations of a Cult,3.0

I actually never dreamed. I did only often. But lately I dream more often. And I get weird dreams, most of them are non-sense. But the thing is, I dream about people which I don't know. I can't see their faces, or I don't remember them. I only see their smile or things. That's how i mostly know if it's a man or a woman.

0.0,84k1c6,0.0,3.0,"Since I was very young, I've had this reoccurring nightmare. It started when I was 8 or so, about a decade ago. The dream starts with an odd perspective. It's my mothers room, and the view is from the roof. It's not quite a corner, but close, against the wall. Back when I was 8, I slept with my mother, since I didn't have a bed of my own and my other siblings slept on the couches and such (also not having beds). From the near-corner view, looking down on me and my mother sleeping, the entire room is cast in a red glow, but there's no light source present. The two corners I'm not looking at (the two behind me) are dark, and the red glow is most prominent around the bed. 

Eerie music is playing, a hum, but unlike any average horror score. After these years, it's almost faded from my mind, but the sound of it was enough to horrify me by just remembering it. But, the oddest bit of all, money is falling from the roof. From the perspective of the dream, I can't see how or where, I just see it slowly drifting onto the floor and bed, with the hum in the background, and the red glow illuminating me and my mother's sleeping figures. I had this dream several times over the span of 8 years, up until I was 16, so much that I can recall the visuals clearly.

Recently, within the last few months, I had a ""continuation"" of this dream. Not the same dream, but instead, I'm there, in the dream. From where it starts, I can see it's a direct continuation. The room is laid out as it was when I was a child, my mother is still in the bed (I am no longer sleeping), and money is no longer falling, but instead strewn about. The bedroom door is directly in front of me and I step through it, revealing a hallway and another door directly in front of me. I don't look to my left or right, down the hall, but go adjacent, through the next door, red glow ever present. I walk into this warehouse it looks like. There's a counter directly ahead of me with a teddy bear on it, and in the background are shelves of the same bear stacked and placed throughout. This bear is clearly from a nightmare, with sunken in glowing eyes and eerily human teeth. But, in the dream, I find that I have a tunnel vision. I can't look away from this bear or it'll move, I know this. But out of the corner of my eye, I see the bears on the shelves twitch, moving just enough to be noticeable. If the dream has an ending, I don't recall it. I've only had that section one time and I haven't had any since.

I'd like to know what the dream means. Obviously, it's a nightmare, and the music and red glow signify that, but I'm confused about the money. The teddy bear warehouse is a standard nightmare, it had no music or falling money, and only had to do with creepy things, but I wonder why it was directly related to the red room before. Why advance after 10 years? My memory likes to impose a teddy bear in the dark corners of the red bedroom, but I know it wasn't there before I had the most recent nightmare.

After my best friend and I played like children outside, with him watching us all the time, she started teaching me how to dance for him, while he was urging us to do it.

In the beginning I apologize for any grammar mistakes because English is not my mother tongue but I try to improve.
I thought long and through about this and decided to share my weird dream that I have been dreaming non stop for a while. Well, not non stop. I've had some other dreams which I faintly remember but this one is like a crystal clear movie tape that I remember from start to finish.
It starts with me going through my town to watch the sunset (I do that sometimes IRL in summer time). But the town streets are a little different and every time I look back the scenery changed. However when I look back at front everything stays exactly the same. I didn't pay much attention to it as if this was completely normal. I approached a mountain behind the town and climbed to the top to watch the beautiful crimson skies as the sun disappeared in the horizon. After smoking a couple of cigarettes I decided to head home. On my way back I stumbled upon a girl who looked very familiar. She called me by my name and invited me for a walk. We walked and walked around the town while talking about our childhood and the things we did together. Then she took a turn to the beach and told me to follow her. Then she stopped at a certain point of the beach. She didn't say a word for about 10 minutes after which she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said ""This is where we kissed. Don't even try to remember it, you were drunk and I decided to use that.""
She was sobbing. I asked her what's wrong. She just looked at me and said ""I wish we could be together.""
And I wake up.
As the title says this is a reoccuring dream which means I've been dreaming this for quite a number of times. All the same details, the same girl, the same words. I am doing research and asking my friends as to if they had seen a girl matching my description. So far nothing. Maybe it's just a dream which I should forget but my curiosity kicks in because it keeps happening again and again.
I'm having questions as to who this girl is and is she still alive. Or maybe she is dead and is f*cking my brain over and over again. Or it's just my mind playing tricks on me.

His voice slowly became more shaky and quiet and he started to convulse and twitch.

basically, i went into a store with a paper. the paper said to walk in, and grab certain items.

the only other things i really remember is seeing someone staring at me with literally this face: "" :) "". like the emoticon was ON THE PERSON'S face. and i just remembered waking up with the only thought on my mind being: ""boring"".

I think what triggered this dream was my strong desire to have a normal family again. Anyhow, back to the dream, i was about 26-28 (19 irl). My father taught me a lot of things he couldn't when he was alive. Both of us spent so much time together, it was like my heart knew i had to cherish him before he disappears again. We lived in a friendly neighborhood, and I met someone special, we both fell in love and were about to get married. My father didn't want me to marry him as he was an orphan but he supported us anyway. Four of us spent really good time together. In dream i saw the person i loved suffering from depression and panic attacks because of his loss just as I suffered after my father's death, therefore I hugged him cried with him consoled him just as i wished to be consoled back then.

I’ve been having lots of dreams lately, all different. Mostly nonsense I can’t remember but there is one really odd thing that keeps coming into all my dreams. 

It looks like a long skinny cat with one big eye, the eye takes up most of its head. And it’s got a tiny mouth and nose, and it behaves like a cat. And it’s greenish yellow in color. It’s body is almost tube like with little legs (much like a dachshund) and looks kind of deformed. As far as I can remember it doesn’t really make any sounds, it’s just kind of snuggly and wants attention.

I’ll be having a normal dream, and all of a sudden this cat-thing bounds up to me and wants to be pet. It’s pretty odd looking so I’m always hesitant to touch it at first, but it always seems friendly.

I used to have a cat when I lived at home, but have since gotten married and my wife hates animals, as well as a lot of other things I used to like a lot ... maybe I’ve been feeling suppressed emotionally and this is my subconscious expression of it or something but I was just wondering what y’all thought about it.

This is not some attention seeking experience I need for my reddit 15 mins of fame 
This is the exact events of what happened to me last night which I have been writing since I woke up at 9am 


Some back story

So for the past week I have been feeling like constant shit with stress from education trying to keep on top of assignments, trying to keep a schedule with working out at the gym, diet, work etc etc the usual adult shit. 

I decided to move out from my girlfriends place back home so I could have more space and sleep better (oh the irony) so I did and I’ve gotten very ill

And here is where the shit storm begins 

Last night I finished my shitty shift at Mac Donald’s and got home at 3am to sleep. I start sleeping and it’s fine, infact I wake up at 7 am not tired somehow. 

I  go downstairs feeling very awake wearing different clothes (from being so exhausted to get unchanged) in a different place without knowing at the time and only realising this looking back on it.

I am now 28 years old and I looked not so different in this life but I was more on the taller skinnier side with long slicked back hair which was messy yet seemed highly praised. I was more experienced in this life and a lot more relaxed. I traveled to write my life stories and decided to settle down two years ago in South Korea because of my job and the community of rushing people with everyone trying to get somewhere while still staying respectful to each other’s common courtesies.

In this place I live on my own with a different girlfriend and I get the train to work, the train looks different and not western (this place seems like South Korea from my interpretation) and I work mid day till mid night in a mall with an open area bar which I must add was beautiful with the same group businessmen coming every lunch as I started to quench their ease into the rest of their working day.

On this day the bar owner, an old Asian man who was like the father I never had. Work for me wasn’t a “job” it was a passion for learning his wisdom and life message. he studied in China for professional bar tending and business as he always reminded me to do the same after he taught me all he could.

 He asked me to come in sooner because he was going to be in the hospital with his wife who has been recently diagnosed with leukaemia, I try to help him with his wife as much as I can with working extra shifts and putting my wage back in his safe so he can pay for her medical bills easier.

So here we are 7am

The life I wish I never had

Just writing it from here has made my face drop and send shivers down my spine

I get up to get a glass of water because I am extremely dehydrated and then go back to sleep for another 2 hours. 

9am 
I wake up and start getting ready for work and to go explore the 6 story mall I work in

10am 
I start walking to the train station and get stopped by a homeless guy for money, he wasn’t the regular homeless guy I normally see, infact the normal guy has been in the same spot for 25 years and never asks for money. I usually bring him a sandwich but today he isn’t there and neither are his belongings, strange- I think to myself leaving the daily slow cooked pulled Korean style pork sandwich, anyway, it’s clear he’s new as he asks for money but no one in this area carries money. I tell him I’m sorry but I genuinely don’t carry money on me because I don’t need it. He spits on the floor in my direction and as I look down he throws a white powder at me while whispering something in Korean and I jump back shocked at what he has done. I explain that what he has done is extremely rude as I have to wear these clothes for work and he ignores everything I have to say and just stands there smiling , Presumably this was him knowing what would later come to me from what seemed to be his which-craft curse, as stupid as that sounds. I feel awkwardly creeped out and my reminder buzzes on my phone *train leaving in 5 mins* 

10:20am
I get on the train and start to feel different but I leave it down to the heat of the packed train and only having 2 hours sleep

10:30am I get off the train and into central Korea. I see strange figures every so often in the corners of my eye as I’m trying to focus on not getting run over. 

10:40am
am I get to work and see there is no one waiting around so I go shopping with the free time I have.

10:50am
 finish looking at all the usual clothing stores I will never be able to afford to buy from and start heading back to work, somehow feeling unhappy because of my comfortable yet strict financial situation.

11am
 I finish opening and preparing the bar for customers. Mostly at this time it’s just juice and iced coffee for the customers but there are sometimes some cocktails required for the eager drinkers. 

12 mid day
The usual punters start coming in, South Korean businessmen with their ties loosened, untucked untucked, Briefcase in one hand and constantly pinging phone in the other.

They are noticeable from crowd with their chuckles and from what I can tell is them having their banter with each other. 

Every day without fail. Coming up the escalators they wave and cheer seeing me another day to relieve their stress. 
They know mediocre English but it’s better than my lack of Korean, despite this we have a strong connection and know what everyone means. The usual Long Island ice teas and if it has been a good day they indulge in the good old college jäger bombs. 

2pm 
Their lunch break is over and they leave to go back to work while saying goodbye and tipping me heavily which I’m sure the owners wife will be grateful for my anonymous donations. 

2pm-10pm
This time just goes by as normal. Fewer iced coffee and juices, more cocktails and beers. 

10:30pm
It’s getting very busy and I’m the only one in. I’m struggling and I’m getting very tired but I’m getting through all the customers, my tip jar is completely full with notes and loose change. 

12pm
It’s still just as busy but has died down now a little. The night worker has come in to take over the shift and will be working till 7am until the process repeats from 9am.

12:05pm
I check my phone and the business men had sent me a message “big win office drinks on us”

12:10pm 
I meet them in the plaza to go to a bar and they take me to some place I have never been before, it’s not exactly the place I would want to be drinking at but it isn’t the worst place

12:20pm 
They are all drinking heavily and having a good time, me not so much. Having weird visuals again and my girlfriend is blowing up my phone

12:25pm
I go outside to ring her, she tells me that the police are looking for me in questioning of the homeless man which blew powder at me. She tells me I need to get to a hospital now because he blew a powdered drug which is used for date rape. I rush in and tell the guys I have to leave, they beg me to stay but I cannot explain the situation to them and run out

12:30pm
I’m progressively getting faster and faster running with my heart beating in my chest. 
I’m seeing more figures out the corner of my eyes making me run faster, heart beet harder and feel more disorientated. 



Just a break from what’s happening here
Yes 
This is not child friendly in any sense
And I bring a graphic warning here
If you are faint hearted

DO NOT READ ON 

(Also for time reference this ends here)

12:35pm
A crowd of people presumably drunk blocking the street outside of a club, I stand for a min and turn around while the crowd disperses and for me to get my breath. 

As I turn around I see 2 people stop running and slow down to a walking pace
I’m thinking oh fucking shit, calm down, calm down, calm down, with heavy breath trying to calm my body before I faint. These people won’t be for me I don’t recognise them. 

I see them point at me and start running, I dart through the crowd and slither into the club, I’m presuming I’m going to be here a while, an EU  kinda stands out in South Korea like shit in a toilet boul

I go to the bar and get an energy drink, they ask if I want water seeing the state I’m in, sweating from head to toe with jäger bomb stain on my shirt from drinking earlier. I accept “yeah thanks, how much for both?” “No no, free” he replies. Oh thankyou. 

I finish half of my water and I see one of the men walk in, I slip into the toilets which were full of drug paraphernalia, smoke, graffiti and broken fixtures. I look for a hiding spot to rest while I feel more woozy. I feel like I’m going to faint.

Guy comes up to me and says “you want” presumably it’s cocaine from the white powder that is lined on a card, I think to myself what worse could happen right now. I take the card and lick all of it off.
He laughs and says something i understand and walks off. I go into a cubicle and lock the door.

I’m sat hiding in this cubicle for what seem to be a lifetime trying to fight off passing out and hallucinations. I gain the strength to get up and leave. I try to sneak out the club and manage to do so unnoticed.

I walk past the club and I’m greeted by one of the men who emerges from a side alley and acts friendly. I keep trying to walk past but he proceeds to stand in front of me. I push him and he then starts to keep grabbing me. I start screaming for help and by standards just watch as we struggle. The other man runs over and grabs a tin out of his pocket rushes to open it, we are still struggling and out of my right eye I see him get out a small see through like straw with and doing something with it, he puts it to his mouth and blows something into my ear. We break apart and I’m still screaming for help as more people watch and stand. The man with the tube puts the tin away and runs down the alley. I am walking unknowing of what they just did to me. I walk around some more trying to get my bearings while being overcome with the substances and tiredness in my system. 
A car comes screeching from the alley and I drop to the floor unable to move any of my body as I am dragged to the back of the car and thrown in the boot and the car speeds off.... 

I am completely out of control and can feel my phone buzzing constantly for the car journey. The car drives until what seems to be outside of the city and is very cold and raining. I am dragged from the car by the two men and into what I think is an abandoned factory. 

The factory is collapsing and inside is a small tent with white walls of which I can only describe as what would be used for csi. 

I murmur all the way till inside to stop with every last bit of energy left inside me as they repeatedly laughed and hit me in the face which I presume was to make me stop. Once inside the tent I saw they had two doctors tables, one with shackles on and the other without. They put me on the first and tie me down. I look around and see medical equipment and surgical tools on a small table beside me. 

With the struggle of getting me into the shackles they beat me until I cough blood while trying to breath. I am unable to see out my left eye and they break my nose, jaw and ribs. 

An old man walks in with dressed for completing surgery and follows him are two people. A man and a women. I can only see silhouettes from the blinding lights above me and the two men continuously strip me naked. The women is in a gown for surgery and the man is holding her hand. She lies down on the bed and the man with her lets go off her hand and walks over to me. I recognise the voice he says “thankyou for all of your service but this will be your last donation”. 


With my last breath I have I scream for help and the brute shackling me takes a swing, I hear the air around his fist moving as it comes closer and closer as if it was time slowing down. This was going to be my last moment on this earth. Complete horror of my legacy being over without it being on my terms. Betrayed by the father figure in my life. My life ended at 28 and being unable to tell my love of my life how much she impacted my life for the last time. 

I scream help unable to move with my eyes close and pain surging through my body, I take a deep breath as if I’ve been starved of oxygen for as long as I could. My body jolts and I roll out of bed. I’m on the floor in a ball shivering with pain flowing through my body. 

I just experienced what seemed to be someone else’s life in the space in one nights sleep and I feel too crazy to tell anyone. 

I urge you people to try and explain to me. What the fuck just happened to me last night. 

Thankyou for your time and patience reading this.

0.0,7wj039,0.0,1.0,"Before I tell you about this dream I have to give you some background. Myself and my wife (Emma) moved from Dublin, Ireland to a small town in North New Jersey. We moved into a 1970’s timber framed building. It’s a much larger house than the one we had back in Dublin. It does creek and there are new noises to get used to. Some I think are temperature shift related, and other due to the wildlife. We live in a wooded area, and wild deer, squirrels, chipmunks and even a black bear are in the area. Although, right now when it is -8c / 17f outside the wild life is usually somewhat quieter, at least that is what I had been told. We've also got two boys, Mattie who is 4, and Ben who is 6.

Emma is really happy in the house, in fact the day before I had this dream Emma had told me how welcoming she felt the house was, and how she enjoyed the vibe of the building…. And then, this dream happened….

I'm in the house on my own. It's dusk, and I'm waiting for Emma to return home. I'm upstairs in one of the bed rooms. In wooden houses there are always noises, mostly due to the wood moving as its heated and cooled during the day. Today is no different. There are crazy temp swings here in the US, yesterday we woke to 5c and went to bed when it was -5c. So I put the noises down to the temp changes. As I'm tiding up, out of the corner of my eye I swear I saw Emma's old handbag move. I glance and everything seems fine again. I'm just tired.

I'm sitting in our American car, outside our house here in NJ, when I turn around to look at something which catches my eye. But when I look back out of the passenger’s window, I see the back of our house in Ireland. Complete the with our neighbour, Nora and her son, Daniel waving at me. I try to get out be realise that the car door can't open. A van is parked right beside me. So, close I can't even open the door. Strange guys come to help move the van, without weighting I try to get out and find myself stuck between the car and the van. I'm thinking ""I must be dreaming"".

I'm back in the house in the US, in bed, I've just woken. Emma returns, walking into the room she says she’s been calling me. I can't find my mobile to check. I look at my watch, which says my mobile is at ""home"" in Ireland... but it was just a dream right... am I losing my mind?

Emma leaves the room, she's annoyed because I'm still in bed. I find the phone, as it has an incoming face time call. It's from a woman I've never met. While she can see me, I can't see her. The name on the call is ""Silvir"". I hang up as Matthew walks into the room. I know Emma has left the house and it's just me and the boys. I'm standing in the laundry room, and Emma's handbag moves. Really moves. I'm not scared, I'm thinking, ""Ohh it wasn't because I'm tired""... The draw to the cupboard I'm standing at closes. I've not got any clothes to put on this morning (I'm in PJ).. what? odd, am I losing my mind?

Mattie walks into the room he's got a treat he shouldn't have. ""Where did you get that Mattie?"" I ask. ""The lady gave it me"" he says. The phone rings, it's Silvir. I don't answer. Mattie is doing something he shouldn't, I got to stop him and the sheets on the bed move... like really move... I look up and a woman with red hair is standing there. The women from the phone?

""What are you doing?"" she asks. 

I ignore her, is she real? I wonder. I walk to Mattie, she starts to scream. It's a voice and angry, and I don't know what it is saying. I think it is in my head. 

Reality shifts. I'm back in bed. Was I sleeping? Mattie is still where he was when I went to walk to him. Ben is here now. He's doing something bold too, I need to stop him, so I get up out of bed. The women is back, ""What are you doing?""... The sheets move on the bed, and I run, looking for fresh clothes to put on. I run around into the laundry room, and through a door I didn't know existed to a large room filled with men’s clothes, my clothes... all laid out like in a store.

There is a scream. Reality shifts. The items in the room move, full stands full of those move across the floor, I turn to follow with my eye. I'm back in bed, its quiet. Mattie and Ben are there in the room. They look scared.

""Don't be scared"" I say… the screaming returns… Ben starts to scream and Mattie to cry, their shoulders are wet, I can see it on their clothes, water is dripping on both of them, from inside the house? how?... I get up and the women is back. She is standing in the room. Screaming. 

Reality shifts. I'm in bed. It really is time to get up. I hear cracks in the house, something like a footstep. I think ""Emma likes this house, she said it feels warm and safe"". There is a large crack sound. Are the sheets moving on the bed? - I must be dreaming. That was a fucked-up dream. I go to get up.

Reality shifts. I'm in bed. Yeah, I really should get up. That was a fucked-up dream. I have to tell Emma. What a nightmare. I hear cracks, is that a foot step. I'm asleep still? - go to get up.

Reality shifts. I open my eyes. I'm in bed. I am awake. I'm not sure I want to be in the house. I hear cracks. I reach for my phone. It is my phone, and it is where I left it. I'm awake.

I was with a little kid, boy I suppose. And we were walking down a path in a what I belive was a wheat field. I think we were trying to get to the ocean on the other side. But then on a little hill to the right we see something green pop up. First we think it is a crocodile, because this area is known for a lot of crocodile attacks. So wr turn around and get ready ro run. But the ""crocodile"" was made out of plastic and had a shape closer to an elephant but still had the crocodile colors. Then we laughed it off and kept going. But like 2 meters ahead a 2nd real crocodile came out of the crops right infront of us. But the crocodile was wrapped in what I believe was newspaper. But the crocodile bites the kid in the foot. And I apparently have a knife in my hand, also wrapped in newspaper, and start beating on the crocodile's head. I try to hit the eyes but i am not sure if I hit them because the wholr body of the crocodile was covered in newspaper. Then evntually the crocodile lets go of the kid and we start running away.

These are some of the few memories I have between the ages of 3 to 6 There are a few things I rember from this time but these strange nightmares are the most clear thing to me. I rember these strange shadow monsters that tormented me and my brother and they were always the same they appeared in the Dark In like a spot light area on a wall and they were always the same for me and MY brother never changing once for me it was these giant shadow cats best I could describe them as is Pumas but they were just shadows and they could talk they kind sounded like the hyenas from the lion king only alot more menacing and aggressive and had this sorta hiss to their voice Meawhile my brother was tormented by a witch on a broom in one of these spotlights she never talk just constantly cakkeled/ laugh. I remember having multiple nightmares about these things only thing is I dont rember when the dreams stoped, what they were saying that made them so scary to me and why Some of these dreams feel more like memories. I rember my parents taking me and my brother to there room some nights during these dreams?, Attacks during the day at my grandma's house which was right next door to our one time I rember throwing tater tots at one of the shadow cats and it some how ate them and laughed afterwards. I rember hearing them outside my tent on camping trips and I rember how my brother was just as scared as I was for a few years but he seemed to forget about this along with everyone else meanwhile I clearly rember these incidents i think are dreams but I'm so confused on how vivid they were and people reacting to them and how it all of a sudden just stoped and no one but me rembers, I'm so confused about this still 20 years  later I know the shadow cats stoped showing up around Kindergarten-1st grade but I've rarely ever had a good dream my entire life they were either nightmares, weird as hell druglike trips or nothing but black and a sensation of falling. I can't rember weather this was just a few bad dreams or something more but they are scarred into my memory!

I did not hear back, I was surprised because my real one is also curly and ginger and we usually always hear back (kinda narcissistic, I know).

This excerpt is from the book ""Zhuan Falun"" which is a very interesting read in and of itself.

It talks about such things as other dimensions, the soul, the cosmos in the microcosm and the macrocosm, supernatural abilities, karma, healing, the true history of mankind, transcending the 5 elements and leaving the 3 realms and many many other interesting things.

The book can be download for free here:

http://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

I will leave you with the excerpt in question about Dreams and Dreaming:

""Now about dreaming, there isn’t any qigong master who wants to explain it. When you were born, a ""you"" was born at the same time in many dimensions of the universe, and they’re part of the complete you, they’re interrelated, and their thoughts are interconnected.

And you also have your master soul, subordinate souls, and other beings, all kinds of them, and they have their images and exist in your body, and every cell and each of your organs assume the forms in which your image and messages exist in other dimensions.

So it’s just extremely complex. In your dreams things are one way one moment and then different the next. Where on earth do they come from, anyway? In the medical sciences they say that this is due to changes taking place in your cerebral cortex.

That’s how it is in this material form, but in reality, it’s the result of your being affected by messages from other dimensions. That’s why you feel all foggy-headed when you’re in a dream. But none of those things have anything to do with you, and you don’t need to pay attention to them.

There is one kind of dream that does directly have to do with you, though, and we can’t really refer to these dreams as dreams: it’s where your master consciousness, meaning, your master soul, sees your family approach you in your dream, or you have a real-to-life experience, or you see or do something.

If that’s the case, your master soul really did do something or see something in another dimension, it’s you who did it, and you were clearheaded and you had a real experience. Those things really do exist.

It’s just that they exist in other dimensions and they were done in other space-times. So can you say they’re dreams? You can’t. Your physical body on this side was definitely sleeping, so for you it’s just a dream. Only those dreams have a direct bearing on you.""",hot,Fascinating View On Dreams,4.0

So whatever event ends and we move the couch I was sitting on back into a dining room.

On our way out it shifts into my workplace, and we're all gathering at the front and the dream turns negative. I get a sort of premonition about fires and for some reason I need to stop them. The family is able to go outside so they're safe, but a few others come with me back to the house.

When we go back there are three spots just catching fire: the back door rug, the kitchen by the stove, and a spot under a lamp where the three couches are. I should add that all this in the dream is an supernatural occurrence, caused by some sort of demon. All leading up to this are little paranormal events.

As I'm carelessly and joyfully taking the candy, hunched over the table with my back turned to the dining room entrance, the 'camera' starts to spin. I'm no longer looking at a 'movie' of the events or in 1st person, this is the point of view of something else and makes me completely detached from myself, thinking this is a decoy that represents childlike freedom. I've always been weary of what's behind me and doubt that I'd, even at that age, just hunch over and stay there with my back turned to the large space. The camera spins faster and faster.

Then the news stopped out of no where on the screen is that our earth is tilting losing its axis bit by bit,  day by day! I didn't feel the earth move but the sun was the dictator of positions in this dream . Some reason our country was slowly becomming the new south pole & I was worrying about the polar bears cause the earth for odd unknown reasons was just quickly by days losing the axis of its former self we know today.

By the end of my dream I was living in a place I didn't own in real life, it was like a tall building to look out the window of a living room,   I was watching the sun moving  traveling and in a circling rotation like it will rise as the sun we know for 6 minutes then sunset quickly change to  rise as a blueish dark sun for 6 minutes and rotate again to the former sun and change to the dark blue sun there wasn't moon in site to see in the sky but some reason it felt like the sun and earth even the axis was a connection and the minutes of rotation I found it beautiful but accepting of change this has happened while everyone else was in a state of fear on the news.

I am really depressed for a while. I feel really bad at least a year. However nothing is really bad about my life. Just feeling awful all the time. 

So I started meditation and my mind started to get better and I started seeing life differently. I got an understanding of what life really means. 

For last month I see same 2 dreams over and over.

My first dream is, I am in a village street. I'm not present there but my mind is there. And nothing happens. All the things in the street (trees, bushes, garbage bins, stones) just stay still. But they loses their properties slowly. Like painting of the garbage bin starts fall of and it starts to rust, stones become dust pieces. It fells like dream goes on for almost 90 years. And my mind as well. I lost some my mind as well. Not like I am going to get mad. Just I became another substance.

My Other dream is, I am in a train. Going to somewhere. Train is all empty. Then a girl with a red dress sits in the seat other side of the train. And his red dress is really revealing. I don't feel attached to her or anything. And she has a cloth doll in his hand. She holds it like real baby. And I go and sit the seat behind her. I touch her baby. And I feel a real urge to look the face of the girl. And I realize she is not human. Another being. Not even living in this dimension. And I wake up.

I stood up and tried to gather everybody to pray, and kept asking if anybody needed saved come to me. Nobody would come to me. Many were annoyed, and kept rolling their eyes.

I was like, ""it is better to die fighting, than to live as a coward! They are going to crash this plane, unless we all stand together!"" They just ignored me and hid their faces.

     A brief personal note: I've always had 'supernatural phenomena' happen around me but have always just pushed it into the ""well that's inconvenient"" category rather than one of fear or wonder. to provide a brief list I've experienced: Ghost lights, objects gaining undue amounts of momentum, Lightbulbs burning out or exploding when I try to turn them on, Objects vanishing, and prophetic dreams (after this story takes place). I don't blame you if this sounds like a crock of shit to you but since I cannot provide an explanation I've just accepted that these things happen to me but I've got no Idea why.

     When I was younger I always had disturbed sleep. By this I mean I was a sleep starved infant  and didn't get a full night of sleep until my first year of middle school (I think). While I cannot attest to what kept me up then I can recount what kept me up throughout grade school. Before this first dream I've no recollection of ever dreaming good or bad but always remembered hiding under my covers for hours on end stressing at the perceived monsters of shadow at the foot of my bed, or on my shelves, or in my closet. As far as I can say that experience might just be a more intense version of what children are often plagued with however what sets it apart is what I think may have been my first dream either way the following is what kicked off ten years of almost nightly night terrors. 

     I'm uncertain whether or not I was asleep during this experience as I was the only witness and my parents claimed the experience to be coincidental at best. I myself am unsure for a few different reasons.

     First Dream?: 
     I wake up in my bed with no recollection of falling asleep (not unusual since I usually passed out from exhaustion instead of sleeping willingly). It's the middle of the night and the streetlight passing through my window above my head is the only thing illuminating my room. I glance repeatedly at the three most 'active' spots of my room (the three spots that the shadows moved most often) [a set of shelves at the foot of my bed holding an assortment of toys, books, and other items that often appeared to move when I wasn't looking at them directly, another set of shelves in the corner of my room above my head and to the right with a bunch of stuffed animals and other such plush items, and my closet to my left that didn't have a door so I could see the amorphous blob of poorly hanged clothing 3 feet to my left.].
     While shifting my gaze across my room I immediately noticed a yellowish light reflecting off of my wall as if a car were turning outside of my room. this caught my attention because my house at the time was in the middle of the block on a one way street. Curious and temporarily less concerned with the shadows at the base of my bed I sit up and turn to look out my window.
     What I see is a man wearing a trench coat (stereotypical I know) holding what appeared to be a very large flashlight sweeping it across the fronts of the houses as if trying to light up every inch of them that he could see. When I looked at him I felt oddly calm, I recall noticing that his light wasn't just casting a circle of light however it was also casting a copper hued light that I swear was casting an image of a penny.
     sweeping back over my house I felt the light wash over me and was blinded momentarily. I remember the rest as a bit of a blur. When I could see again he was starting into my yard running at my window seemingly yelling something though making no noise while pointing in my window, I looked behind me, see nothing wrong then when I go to turn back look up and see one of my stuffed animals falling towards me. I woke up with a start after that, immediately slamming my face into my bedside table since I was laying on my side.

     reflecting on it now and the images from it that I still recall I realize something was off about that scene at the end just before looking up, there was light being cast on me from both his light and the streetlamps outside but when I turned to look at my shelves there wasn't a shadow on the wall.

     This was my first weird dream and possibly my first dream in general assuming it was a dream to begin with. I have quite a few more dreams that I'm pretty sure are connected to this one and I think I may have figured out what they were symbolizing however to share that conclusion I'd need to go over at least 3 more dreams/nightmares (reoccurring ones at that) if not more.

     To refrain from killing any readers with text more than I have already I'm going to bust this up into parts so maybe people will actually read it.

     TL:DR: Weird things happen to me, I had night terrors for almost 10 years, what's written above is what kicked them off, and I'm interested to see what anyone else has to say about this (such as if this is even the right sub reddit for this kind of thing)

What did I look like? I was myself, a scrawny boy, bare faced and dressed in linen.  I had no weapon. I had nothing; except a small cream colored snake with me. 

We were on a journey to defeat “The Great Evil One” who lived beyond the horizon, past the mountains and beyond the valley. 

These men were much stronger than me, hurdling over rocks- or simply breaking them with their strength. I felt utterly useless, and feeble. How was I going to help defeat the Evil one? 

“Here my boy, hold fast to this ledge- quite so! Here, be aware of this rock; it’s loose.”

The snake’s gentle words reassured me, and I felt safe. I was able to climb over the rocks and match pace with my comrades. 

I found company in the snake. Though the other men wouldn’t speak to me, the snake and I grew fond of each other.

At last, the sun was to set, and each man grew silent. They were aware of the austerity of their position. 

The last drops of shadow collected, and formed themselves into dark, hideous beasts- monsters with maws dripping poison and eyes full of bloodlust.  

The other men fought them, and I, carrying nothing but the clothes on my back, ran behind them. 

I ran away in fear, but out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of some strange, fractured feature- a wall- jutting out between the rocks. 

“Over there, my lad! Over there,” my snake cried. 

I ran over, saw that the house was stable enough to take cover in, so I cried out to the others. 

The men fought their way to the house, and shut the door on it’s rusting hinges. We quickly lit made a fire and lit candles. The monsters could not reach us here. 

We inspected each room, to make sure the house was as unoccupied as it appeared to be- and it was. 

Most of the men fell asleep in the hallways, but I found a room to myself and the snake. 

I looked out into the hallway, and saw that the men were tormented by flies. I could do nothing to stop the flies; they were everywhere. 

Everywhere but my room. 

My snake ate any fly that came too close to us. 

We talked for hours the snake and I, until I fell fast asleep. I had to rest for tomorrow, we’d keep going on our journey.

0.0,7kfr8o,0.0,1.0,"I have been having bizarre dreams as of late. Very real dreams or dreams within dreams. Not like inception but more waking and realizing I’m still in the dream. 

I dreamt of people meeting at a house. They were familiar as if from high school or my younger past. There were men and women there. Not many maybe five-ish. The house was lofty as in high ceilings dark but with light. Not sure but had the feeling of a white light Christmas tree but not. There were people around this island like you would see in a kitchen but not as defined. There was a candle light ( one stick with light on top) in the middle. A man and a women were standing there on either side. Woman on the left man on the right. The man seemed upset, almost a subtle upset. As not to let me see. 

Felt her say something to the effect of “this is his first time “ or “ he doesn’t know “ or maybe “realize “. Then in the dream I remember the dream from the night before. It was the same dream or maybe it was just the same feeling. It’s fading now and hard to hold in my hand. It was like a time loop. Some people were aware of the time loop others were not. I was terrified to write this as it had a feeling of if I tell others would be hurt. She whispered to me the feeling of “ we know you know” or I see in your eyes the realization. They seemed to have been in this loop longer. The man was angry or panicked about me knowing. The woman seemed to understand more or was familiar with me, because I Was stricken with a panic I have not felt before. A sense of trapped though it seemed I was free as long as I didn’t let on I was aware of the time loop or repeating dream. 

The reason for the meeting in the first place was like old friends meeting up before a high school reunion or a large meeting of others. I had a feeling that some of the other 5-ish might have known or suspicion of the loop of time or dream. The man and woman from the island for sure did. Almost as if it wasn’t my dream but all of ours or we were in a place not of my own but of a reality or space. I started to maybe indicate in my head that I was going to tell people when we got to the larger gathering or at least confirm with the others their to try to lose my panic. Then they ( maybe just the man or woman from the island)motioned to these long white doors with windows or that pattern you would see at a hall of multiple doors with white lines dividing the glass. I saw two of the other out there, on the other side of the doors. It was dark, like space, and empty. They were almost floating away. It felt like an sign of if you tell others at this gathering these will be hurt. There skin was turning black or dark grey and cracking as if from the cold. I immediately thought I won’t tell anyone. ( throughout the dream I was trying to find if other did know which was frowned upon and watched) we went to leave as we did in the previous dream yesterday. 

We were outside walking to a car. I felt very panicked. That panic of you have found something out but you feel there is so much more and it terrifies you. Like an iceberg and he darkness below holds so much more information. I feel this panic was on my face plain as day. The man from the island said I didn’t even realize who or where  or the idea that I had so little information that “ what do you have to be panicked about “. As if he had been there a while and known a lot more of this loop in time or dream world. He told me to look up at the sky. The sky was bright with green and purple. Quite beautiful actually. It was very dark like a moonless night in the woods were you can see every star and it’s like a haze of little pin point lights. He motioned of “ what do you see” and I somehow told him, but he indicated he saw his worlds stars not mine. And that this shape he was in was not his waking shape. That I saw him this way as to not scare me or maybe to keep this ruse going for the others in the reality. That his form would seem so weird or alien to me that I would have realized more sooner. And that I too him am different. That my form was changed for him. This part I’m not sure of or if he just said this to make me feel better or to bring the panic off my face( in regard to me being what was familiar to him). He had the feeling of you don’t even know what you are in or getting into or are trapped in or something of my being so ignorant. The woman made me feel as if none of them truly did . They knew more than me but not all of it . This calmed me down some. But the panic of them realizing that even them who seemed to know so much more did know why they were here or they knew more and knew if I knew I would panic even more. I woke up at this point I think with a shiver down my spinal cord. I have never felt that cold shiver before. 

I say I think woke up at this point because through the night I truly woke up to the waking world twice ( not counting now) and dreamt two more times maybe. Maybe I fell back to sleep but I remember trying to tell my wife about this whole dream and the people who were aware I was dreaming and they were dreaming or we were in another world/reality. At first when I began she was trying to comfort me as she would in this waking world. Ready to understand and comfort me. But when I start to pour out my ideas or emotions (the panic ) of this idea of knowing and others there knowing. Her eyes turn black. This is when I realized I wasn’t awake and wasn’t truly sure I had ever awoken the first time. Almost as if it was a test to see if I would tell my tale to this world. I feel i awoke then for real. I went to the bathroom with my heart racing. When done I came back to bed. I was scared to sleep again but felt/knew I was supposed or just wanted get more answers. 

I won’t recount the other two dreams as they seem to be fading into a dot of feeling. Like a large net being reeled into a ball with the fish being the points of feelings or ideas. What I will say about the other two is that in the second there was a moment where I asked a powerful (appeared to be an older woman) “what of my waking life” or “what will happen to my waking life” and she touch the middle of my forehead and I immediately awoke. Clearly in this women world. As if sent back or my information taken or I wasn’t worthy of the information or I was being sent somewhere else maybe. 

In recounting this I am scared that someone (a soul) somewhere will be hurt if I tell this in the waking world but I  also feel so terrified. I cried in the shower this morning thinking of all of it. It is starting to swirl down the drain of this reality now. Did I make a mistake posting this? Can I hurt others out there with my words here? Am I crazy? They felt like people separate from me , is this possible?

My best friend and I are nearly 30 and have been friends since we were ten. When i was young, my parents had a lot of problems and her home and family were a refuge to me. Now we are both married. I have two children, she has one, and we live on opposite ends of the country. In spite of the distance, we remain very close. We talk almost every day. She is my dearest friend. 

In my dream, I am back east in my friend's childhood home. It has been remodeled with additions and I am having trouble finding my way around. I am wet and cold and have been swimming (something we used to do a lot together in our youth. My friend's home had an above ground pool and my friend and I swam in it endlessley). 

There is a new addition to the home outside. An enclosure containing a hot tub and a pool. We are swimming in there. There is some sort of party, and most people are in the pool but I am in the hot tub because I am cold. My friend seems distracted and unhappy. I notice this thick, black smoke in the distance. At first it appears as if it is a quickly approaching black tornado. I warn everyone. They seem unconcerned. The tornado, with unbelievable speed, zooms toward us. Finally aware of the danger, everyone rushes indoors. My friend and I go to her childhood bedroom. I tell her that I see the smoke through the window. It appears to be sentient. It appears to know I see it, and it sees me back. My friend and I draw the curtains and cover the windows with blankets. Though she is shockingly nonchalant about the threat of the sentient Smoke, she appears to take it more seriously than everyone else. Some time passes. I wander, lost, around her home. Carefully avoiding being seen through windows by the smoke. After realizing that everyone else is unconcerned by the Smoke, I return to my friend's room (seemingly the safest place in the house) and I begin to focus on her mood. I ask her if she is okay. She admits to me that she is not in love with her husband. She has met another woman, a sister of a separate friend of mine from college who my friend has never met. In real life, my college friend has no sister. Only brothers. 

I support and comfort my friend, insisting that her husband is a potato and that she should be happy with the woman she loves. In real life, I have known her husband since first grade. He is a simple farmer and a good man. Though he is not extravagant in any way, I am happy for my friend. He loves her and their young daughter and provides for their little family. I might call him 'boring' but he loves my dearest friend, and for that I love him. 

Anyways, my friend, in the dream, is concerned that her mother will never accept that she is in love with a woman. In real life, her mother is a conservative Christian woman, and this would be a real concern. 

After ensuring my friend that her happiness is very important and I love her no matter what she chooses, she seems to feel a little better. The concern returns to the sentient smoke outside. The smoke has notices us through a small opening in the window. We realize it is coming for us. My friend and I hide under a black blanket together. We hold hands, snuggle close, and wait.

I was terrified and immediately went to turn on the light switch. When I turned it on, nothing was there, but when I turned the light switch off, I could see it again.

I did and it was horrifying.

It was like 5-6 years ago when I was actively try to have lucid dreams. Back then I had sleep paralysis every other night and some night this lead to an awesome lucid dream. I looked it up on the internet, learned to some extend how to controll it and tried every night to trigger a sleep paralysis since then. It worked maybe 3 out of 10 times, mostly I had just this terrible feeling of being paralysed followed by a dreamles night but it was always worth the try for me. Until that one night.

I've read about incubus, small demon-like creatures sitting on your chest while sleeping that people could see during a sleep paralysis. While i never had this happening to me I had a similar, maybe even more frightening experience.
One night i managed to get into a semi-lucid dream. 
After I ""shook off"" the sleep paralysis I got out of the bed. It was night, I was in my room, in my parents house. I thought I just woke up until I realized I wasn't walking but floating through the house like a ghost (my favourite thing in dreams is flying and even indoors I would always float above the ground).
I was floating through my house at night, wondering why I was stuck here. I knew I was dreaming but normally I would just change the setting. Here I was powerless. One of the things I remember mostly today is the lonely feeling of walking around the house at night in the dark.
I still enjoyed floating around though so I did. 
At one point I got past the big mirror in our guest room. 
What I saw in there wasn't me, it was some sort of demon or ghost. Memories of dreams are always blurry but I if I had to describe it I would say it looked like a spectre with a pale, featureless face with only a gaping, black mouth at the lower center.
I woke up immediately and I remember still feeling the terror every time I looked into the mirror even days after that. It just felt so fucking real, even now I get chills thinking about it. I didn't get real sleep at least a week after I saw that creature.

Needless to say I never tried having lucid dreams after that. I have very vivid, happy dreams most of the time anyway.
It was a horrifying experience that I will always remember as one of the worst nights I ever had. 
But beyond that it made me wonder: I never heard of someone seeing himself in a dream, especially not in a mirror. Is it always such a nightmarish sight or is it just my association with dreams and mirrors after that night?

 I hope everyone has had some decent dreams to enjoy.

I am not usually one to try and interpret a dream, and in fact I've only ever done so maybe twice or three times. However, this dream has caught my attention, and I would greatly appreciate it if i could get some different perspectives on what this dream means.

It is a dark night, in which I cannot assume the time. There is but one street light. I see this blonde woman in what looks like a long brown coat, except it was not cold. Suddenly there is a coffin, a sarcophagus-esq type coffin. I open it up to see a woman inside it, and suddenly I am that women from that coffin. A sudden urge to kill this blonde women on the street surges through my body as if it were natural and on impulse I start going towards her.

The blonde woman stops on the outer edge of where the street light can barely reach. She turns around and stares directly at me. I feel like I want to hide, so I don on this dark ominous robe that covers every inch of my body. All of a sudden my perspective changes.

I am no longer this woman from the coffin, and the blonde women starts to sing something, while continuing to not stare at this women, but me. I can barely hear her. The dark clothed women disappears and then immediately she reappears behind this blonde women and they are in sync with this song and all of a sudden I can faintly hear what they are singing and it begins with ""Shadow Whispers....calmly..."" the rest i can vaguely remember. The dark clothed women, or rather not a women anymore, but more of a dark monster-like figure goes in for the kill, as they both continue to sing, but right as she goes for her neck, I am awoken, but not fully.

I am in what could be known as a sleep-paralysis state. I can barely open my eyes but I see a hand on my shoulder.  This women, the owner of this hand, whispers ""get up...it's time to go."" This voice, I felt uneasy seeing the hand on my shoulder, and forced myself to wake up, while the whispers of ""get up...go"" kept filling my head. Then I was fully awake, and very confused from this very vivid and surreal dream.

I can vaguely remember the rhythm of the song, but the words i heard from it seem ominous in a sense. All I can remember now are the words ""Shadow whispers...calmly"" and that's it.

Well that's my dream and I guess my sleep-paralysis experienced that followed afterwords. I'd gladly appreciate any interpretation on it!

First thing I saw was the phone in my hand that looks like a gem (the shape of it is the same as the phone we have right now but the looks of it is extremely different, the phone is covered in some kind of live wallpaper *whole phone, front side and back* and when i touched it *no matter where you touch it* it unlocks, it's like the phone has fingerprint scanner throughout the whole phone and it doesn't have any buttons anywhere. you just simply grind your finger in the left to lower or upper the volume. the UI is pretty much the same but it looks different. when I opened the camera, the phone became invisible except the outline of the object, it simply captures what's inside the box.

the buildings are also different because the atmosphere is somewhat split into two. there are floating buildings that looks like islands and the vehicles are flying.

Putting a lot of strain on my head and neck and fracturing one of vertibre,
 
2 days later, I am experiencing extremely strange dreams,
 Last night being the most memorable.
 It involved a menacing clown that would simply intimidate myself and a few random guests in the dream. My brain must have been running at max capacity to create such a world of generated faces. 
Anyway, the clown with its bright orange BOZO looking hair and yellow suit would appear at the edges of flashlights at the end of an abandoned road and chasing us. We ran into a house where he simply knocked and one of my award winning dream guests just let him right in. Maybe he used some sort of mind controlling on the others in the dream, or perhaps they did not know who this clown was, but I knew. And he knew that. I remember specifically 
The clown would savagely and indiscriminately just hack the guests with a double sided axe, like one hit. Just slaughtering throughout the guests.
He would throw them around like rag dolls. As if they were weightless. 
I remember he wouldn't give the dead respect either. 
The clown would use his strength to direct the victims into one central hallway, where he would after clearing the room, get very close to any body who was clinging to life after his violent attack. He would grab the living by the back of their neck and just slam the living remaining victim around among the pile of murdered people. Crushing their limbs and letting them just scream and rant as he got closer and closer to their faces. 
I was always left in a corner unharmed.
Just watching this happen and feeling too shocked to even react. 
I woke up sweating profusely.

#Hotel Trip

It takes place at my home city, but replacing my apartment with a high-end hotel and the dock is connected to it rather than being across the street. Was actually a pretty cool place to be honest. It started off with me waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning feeling extremely tired and struggling to stay awake. I went downstairs to the garage and got in my car, tried to drive to the exit, which ended up leading to the docks/pier thing where I found a very coastal-style bar. Decided I'd go in, and holy hell there were so many people. Decided I didn't want to be part of that mess and tried to go back  to my car, but couldn't find it. I kept hitting the lock button and eventually found it from all the beeping and flashing lights. Got in, then drove halfway around the block. I don't remember what I was trying to do but I parked next to the garage, got out holding a map, and started walking around. Not 10 seconds later I look back at my car and there's a tow truck picking it up. It was a very big tow truck, I went up and yelled at them ""hey what the fuck are you doing? I can't have my car towed! It's not even illegally parked!"" They didn't say anything, just shrugged and started driving off. As I chased them the tow truck turned into some sort of airport tug, towing what looked like the back of those military transport trucks, which was also towing my car. I kept yelling at them, the driver just made that 'hang loose' hand sign and was gone. 

I waked back up to the hotel, where I found my ex coworker (we'll call her Becca). I asked what she was doing here and she said she was staying with me. She's a little weird but friendly enough. We both realized we didn't have the key card to get in, so I started trying to call my dad but being extremely tired and half conscious made that pretty hard to do. 

We were sitting at the stairs, as an old couple approached us from below. I went to the railing and they started asking some pretty weird questions. The man wanted me to take my socks and shoes off and see my feet, I of course replied with ""the fuck? No"" and the lady just looked at me and said ""a man knows what he wants"". Becca and I looked at eachother weirdly and tried to go up the elevator. 

We eventually got back into the room with no key card. I asked her if she wanted to smoke a bowl, she said yes, so I went and got my pipe and some weed. I came back into the room and she was gone.

I decided to make some food but the microwave's magnetron was dying, so my food came out still cold. I ended up finding a box full of disinfecting wipes, and brought them to my room. I watched out my window and ended up seeing two women riding a street bike up the grass hill, and then two others jumping into a small grassy pond. Thought it was a little strange. 

I then went to my bed and tried to sleep, but couldn't, and proceeded to eat the wipes, mistaking them for food. After getting through a good 10-15 of them I realized these wipes aren't food, they're disinfecting wipes. They're not supposed to be eaten. Why did I eat so many and why did they taste so damn sweet? This can't be good. 

I then went to the bathroom to try to vomit them out. I couldn't, but started noticing weird yellow blotches forming all over the shower. I tried to wash them off with the shower, which ended up causing them to melt. Then the shower itself started to melt. Realizing I'm probably about to die, I just laid there, everything faded to black quickly and then I woke up about 10 minutes ago.


This dream took place around an hour and a half in waking hours, and the dream time was roughly the same (took place between 4 am and 6 am). My god, that felt really real though. T break dreams can be fun and are typically partly lucid (can control myself and be conscious, but not aware it's a dream)

#Superboating

This one ended up more fun, but also somewhat scary. Not in a nightmare sense, more of an adrenaline rush kind of scary. Not as long though.

It was a nice summer day so I decided I'd go boating with my dad. He got a new boat, similar to what he has now but bigger and somewhat weirdly proportioned. We boated around the lake and drank beer as per usual, then my dad decided to go out to the ocean this time. 

We go through the locks and into the sound. Nothing out of the ordinary really. I noticed there was a large cliff where seattle would usually be though. It looked pretty cool but was definitely different. Also noticed the San Juan islands weren't there. I looked east and noticed a rather large storm coming about. I said we should go back, but my dad insisted we'd be fine. 

The storm approached very fast. Within a matter of seconds it had gone from over 10 miles away to right over our heads. With a sea storm comes waves, of course. Big ones. Over 100ft tall. I was freaking out a bit, and my dad looked at me and said ""watch this!""

Oh shit, here we go. We went full speed towards the first wave and plunged right into it. I was freaking out, then held my breath as we went in. My dad just said ""hey man it's okay to breathe"" so I took in a huge breath and noticed I could breathe fine. The cabin was water tight, evidently. We did this a few more times, then I woke up. There's probably more to this dream but it was a while ago and I've forgotten some of it, might have written it down somewhere though.

#Mall Punching Spree

This one was fun. 

Also had this one a while ago. It started off in my apartment. It was VERY vivid. I brushed my teeth and noticed my hands looked pretty weird though, and distorted hands is my main reality check, so as soon as I saw that, the dream went full lucid. The dream was already a carbon-copy of real life as it was, but now I have total control over it. I remember seeing a bright ball of energy floating around through the apartment prior to becoming lucid, this was the only non-real thing that happened though. Everything happened in chronological order throughout the dream. 

I decided to go to the mall and screw around. I got there, and knowing I was in a dream, I decided ""hey, what if I act like it's GTA and just walk up and punch/shoot people?""

So I did that. It was fun for a second, but then I heard people screaming in fear/pain and blood on the ground. The screams were so life-like. The pain sounded so real and genuine. It wasn't anything like a GTA killing spree. Then I heard police sirens coming. Man, for a brief moment I was convinced this wasn't a dream and that I had actually gone around hurting and killing people. I started freaking out a bit, thinking about what I had done and all. My life is over now. Then I looked down at my bloody hands, and they were still distorted. 6 fingers on each and they were all twisted and bigger/smaller than normal. 

Realized I was dreaming again after that and then woke up not long after feeling pretty damn weird. Maybe this would've been more fun during an induced lucid dream, but goddamn, it's a little too 'real' feeling to do that during a T break dream. 

Well, there's a few of my crazy dreams I get during a break from weed. It can be fun, scary, or just downright weird, but interesting nonetheless. What's the craziest dreams y'all have had? Especially if you smoke weed, what's the weirdest dream you've had during a break from weed?

The dream continues with me driving on a dark trail. I don't remember it being bumpy, I just remember it being a little strange. I parked at dawn near some gravel hills. I put a blue mark where I knew I needed to go, for when I was supposed to come back to my car. I walked up the hill while helping someone with something, and turned around, only to realize that water was rising over my car where it was parked. 
I remember saying ""I need to reach for it,"" since it appeared to be in arm's reach. A group of guys approached me and said to put on a water suit and water mask to go under and grab it, since it was apparently the only way.
Later on, I'm almost done fitting in the suit but I never completely finish putting it on. I was struggling with the hands. 
I looked down to see that the car was even deeper in the water. The water had risen up so high, that my car was about 50 feet away. Suddenly they wanted me to join a band. So I kept being held back by these guys, and wanting to get to my car. I couldn't. I felt stranded, stressed out, and a little confused. But I couldn't control myself and stop interacting with them. Then I woke up. 
TLDR- I stormed off in a car on a strange, dark road. I parked it, walked up gravel hills, then saw water rise over my car, and no matter what, people who seemed to be helpful ended up holding me back from ever reaching my later on submerged car.

I woke up this morning thinking about that dream. Then it hit me, while I was dreaming, my brain calculated how much $101k adds up to for 52 weeks. I've been blown away by this all day. I can't even calculate how much 36x12 in my head. But my brain either somehow knew to calculate 1,995x52 or 101k/52. The letter only said $101k, So I either didn't see or remember the remaining numbers or my brain did not calculate the hundreds, tens, and single values. Still pretty mind blowing, I think.

I was waiting for a bus. The detail of the bus stop is not important, but let me say that there was a dead angle that I couldn't see. I was waiting for a bus, or something to come, or maybe someone. But she was there all along, under the dead angle. Maybe a table? Maybe a rock.

I knew her. I loved her when I was young. It was one sided love I was never able to confess. I don't know anything about her nowadays, but I still have a good memory of loving her.

She was lying on a floor, under a blanket. She was watching a phone. We had a little chat, she stood up, the bus came. It wasn't one I was waiting for. She left her phone on the floor so I picked it up.

On the phone was her sex video playing. The man I couldn't see but it wasn't me. She I couldn't see either but it was clear as day that it was hers. She snatched the phone from me, hastly. But I slowly realize.

It was my room. My room has a rather rare wallpaper on the wall and not so unique bed in front of it. It was my room where she had a sex with her boyfriend and took a video of it.

I started questioning her, was it my room, was it my room, did you brought your boyfriend to my room, look at my eyes! She is avoiding eye contact all the time. I ask some trivial questions and she doesn't avoid the contact. And I ask, was it you, and she doesn't break the contact, but hides her one eye with her hat.

Now the starting point can be anywhere it seems the dream is dimensional, and lucid in being able to feel but not alter. The dream has a story but I never get to finish it. Regardless the dream will open somewhere on earth with someone's child being snatched up and taken away, and I'm seeing through the eyes of the parent or guardian figure. The child is seen being taken into a cold abandon building by a huminoid figure. It is always rainy, or dark in this dream and so the guardian figure, which as of late has been a City Detective, A Country Mom, Lastly a Suburban Dad always go in search of said child in the rain and dark. They come across the building of which they enter. Upon entering they are in the lobby of a old 30's- 40's insane asylum lobby, electricity working but nobody present. They almost always see the rainy footprints leading right down a dark descending hallway, they never choose to walk through the front lobby double doors, and I've never seen what's on the left. They also seem to be locked in the Asylum unable to escape now, almost if they were lured in. So the Guardian figure that I'm seeing all of this through descends down the hall, the first room is dimly lit, shadows as if people moving in the background, There is nothing here. They keep on going and descending down this stairwell like hallway, they then come across this room piled high with dismembered bodies, how livid, tland these bodies are being consumed by 2 gluttonous mouths but the bodies never stop piling up, the entire room is a shade of red presumably from the blood. The gluttonous mouths never notice the Guardian so the Guardian climbs over the body piles and continues in search of their child, they go a room deeper which expands into this giant hall where you can't see the ceiling not because it's pitch black but because it's tall, this room is filled with giant delapitated stone pillers. In every instance there are creatures just outside the sides of the pillar rows and it's good to stay in between. Now here's the catch, none of the Guardian have made it beyond this room as I usually wake up, the Country mom thought she heard the voice of her child and was lured outside the pillar row and mulled and cut up, chainsaw in pieces by lanky tall, demonic Chainsaw welding Clown Zombie men. The Suburban dad tried fleeing back to the to the lobby, he was then torn apart by the Gluttonous mouths, ripped in half, and then replaced as a dead body on the piles of bodies as if reappearing from thin air. The Detective I don't know what happened to him, the last I seen was him bursting to tears and collapsing on the floor in the pillar room, two scenarios then happen, either I wake up on a cold sweat or the dim fire lamp lights in the pillar room go out and the detective then looks down the pillar room to go deeper.

I then watched the attendants of my funeral funnel in in text format from another world. I went through this re birthing cycle a number of times, some of which involved meeting people from past lives. Each time I met a person from a different world I was promptly disposed of. In some of these lives I was taken advantage of sexually multiple times. In one world I was even able to have intercourse with a model. Each world had its own form of currency that I was able to obtain by recalling dark times from other worlds. These worlds also held different languages that I had to translate in order to live for more than seconds before committing suicide again. I vividly remember Japanese being a language that was used in between translations within alien worlds. After achieving greatness in each world I ended my life in some form of suicide. Each of these suicides was successful and consistent with my life ending in other worlds. The only death that wasn't self provoked was the death that happened within my original world. After this first natural death, I was re birthed into worlds at different ages. As I stated before, each of my deaths in these worlds ended in suicide. I met people I had known online, family, and celebrities. I vividly remember the rapper actor in the movie 2 fast 2 furious killing me with a gunshot to the head. Multiple times within these dreams I found my way back to observing a world where I enjoyed video games.

Later he grew up and he was playing the guitar at home and stuff but a cable got unplugged and i went down to fix it even though I wasn't able to do so.

Then i came back to his house and there appeared a little girl who was supposed to be a family member and I told her I was looking for Kurt, she told me he went to his ""singing"" room where he sings because he's shy and likes to sing alone.

I went to that room and I saw two or three guys leaving that room and then we started talking about stuff and suddently he fell on me, looked at me and we started making out, (which is weird because i'm not homosexual) and later in the same room we were talking about that I had to leave and that i had to come back to the future.

We had a good time talking and i showed him my smartphone, then he showed me his computer, everything with talking in between,  and i told him if he could give me a picture of him with a autograph for me and with the year ""2017"" on it, so i could have it as a ""souvenir"" from that time travel, then we hugged and stuff and i started seeing a red construction being constructed as same as timelapses are, very weird, and then I woke up.

The weird fact is that when I was with him I felt so comfortable that I did not feel bad in any moment o the dream, but in the same night before dreaming with Kurt, I had a very stressing dream. 
And now when I just woke up and started writing down everything I still was feeling that warmth i had in the dream.

It was pretty cool, actually, because he wasn't even trying to be funny. He *really* wanted you to feel bad, and another symbol was just a scribble of his pseudonym sprayed on a concrete wall. 

Example: 

- The Powerpuff girls were twisted into female adult rape victims who had cum everywhere and nipples on their buttcheeks. The background color was a bright red as they were being humiliated.

- The Rocket Power kids were a bunch of thugs with guns shooting people in the alleys.

I also showed up in my motorcycle and my whole gear, something my family doesn't even know I have, and i was just trying so hard to hide it from them while I had my gear on and so I removed all my gear and just left it at a table and my family didn't even notice.

We're joking around and just having some banter and in this dream he's the slightest bit taller than me. He gives me a hug and I hug him back and he then kisses me on the cheek. Then I can't remember what leads us to do this but we go on a bus because we are going to the train station to go to central London and this is on a school day when we should both be in class. Whilst at the train station I loose my bag and start panicking and then we split up to find it and he finds it and brings it back to me with a present I then hug him and thank him. We stay in central London till late and he gets drunk somehow. I don't know where he lives so I take him back to school. When I get to the classroom the other sociology teacher is waiting there. I explain the situation and we try to help sir sober up but he's gone to sleep. She then asks me if I had sex with him.

Then he starts shouting at me saying you don't even work here, you haven't got a uniform and really starts shouting at me. He then proceeds to push me and he does this three times and I say IM A FUCKING MINOR, IM UNDER 18. He then goes ""oh no... I don't care"" and punches me in the chest. He then calmly walks away and now I am determined to sue him. I ask my manager if I can sue him and she's like yeah of course. So I get a lawyer and he's like u can win this, we have enough evidence and then when he reads the name of the guy I'm suing he's like ""nahhhhhhhhh, I'm gonna skrrrr da pa pa ka ka ka out this door"" ( he didn't actually say that but something along the lines of ""no"") he tells me there is no chance of me winning as anyone that has tried to sue him as lost and then ended up dead.

Here's what I wrote down as I was becoming awake, when I remembered it the most.

*Tirina Tablinka (name, old, large woman. Spelling unclear.)*

*She took me away from something normal....a (my old band) concert where my stuff wasn't plugged in, big, old theater like the Newport (music hall in Columbus, OH.) My stuff was in this backstage room, but all of the cables were wrapped around things like Xmas lights. Speakers were sitting sideways on shelves on the ceiling. The band started Cyanide without me. I fixed my gear and went out. I don't remember the show. I remember going outside for a minute afterward, then the next part starts.*

*This really old, posh hotel seems connected to the venue. There was an older woman, like a smaller version of Connie, and she was also Tirina. Tirina is a shapeshifter.*

*We played some old, posh game of sorts, like a parlor word game or something, during which Tirina talked about the hotel, the name started with an M, and about how the marble was from the 1600s, and suddenly, she opened a door into darkness, then we were walking, almost gliding through this dark swamp that appeared to be in the woods between (childhood neighbor's) house and the road, going slowly toward the road in the dark through waist-deep water. Tirina's voice was echoey and watery coming from nowhere, like in my head, as she told us something about not being afraid.*

*Next thing I remember is being back in the fancy hotel room and gasping for air. My nose was completely closed, and my chest was tight from trying to speak. Tirina, now as the large woman in pink with thick black glasses, laughs quietly and tells me to calm down. She's sitting to my side, observing me.*

*I wake up gasping. As I wake, I can still feel my nose being plugged, and what feels like a hand grasping my lungs every time I breathe.*

We were all trapped in this one section (trapped in by metal bars)  panicking when a demon humanoid like woman started walking up to all of us from the other side of the bars.

Thinking to myself real hard that i did indeed locked both locks. This time i closed it without locking it. Then I saw it with my both eyes, it opened...then close....and open again...over and OVER AGAIN as if it was trying to mess with me or get me scared. Then I started to get a little dizzy and drowsy. So I sat back down keeping my head down, but looking from the corner of my eyes. Then I had a vision that both the bathroom and my bedroom doors was gone. Across the bathroom was my bedroom, that how I saw my bedroom door. While one door was gone another door appear hovering over the floor. It then slide against the bathroom wall to my left. As if it was trying to tell me a door used to be on this wall. Then I ""woke up"" from the little dream or vision I had. I checked the doors and both doors were still intact. I then ran to tell my uncle about what I just went through. He told me that there was in fact a door that leads outside when it was on the bathroom wall, but they turned it into a window. I then asked him who was the person who used to live in this house before them? The name was ""Sarah Rico"". My uncle didn't know much about her since she passed away a long time ago. So i searched her up on Google and it showed me that Sarah was a mental I'll person, she's been dead a long time, but her soul still wanders so she stays and haunt the people in her home. There was a bible and on the cover of it has Roman numbers that says, ""xvii"". The pastor who had this bible was explaining on how to seal her away on a video website. Idk what happened after that. 

But now that I'm awake in reality, I did search up the two things that bothers me most. I searched on Google (irl this time, not a dream) ""Sarah Rico "" and ""xvii"". Surprisingly, the first thing that pops up for Sarah Rico was a Facebook page in 2012 about a memorial refund. Aparently her family was having issues paying the extra bills from Sarah's cancer. 

For the ""xvii"" i searched for what it means. And Google says, "" In Italian culture, the number 17 is considered unlucky. When viewed as the Roman numeral, XVII, it is then changed anagrammatically to VIXI, which in the Latin language translates to ""I lived"", the perfect implying ""My life is over.""

I had a dream last night- there were many scenes, but one in particular was odd to me.

There Were three ladies, older, sitting on stools in a circle.

Two I can not remember the faces of, but the third was speaking to them.

I was standing near the circle, and they were aware of me.

The lady who was facing me talked about what may have been insecurities, I cannot remember.

Her attire, however, is very clear still. She wore an all black robe, like a nun's clothing, and a mask, banana shaped, but with dull eyes, like in masquerade pieces.

She said she had finally decided to take off the mask, and the other two women, along with myself, applauded her.

But, as she faced us, her mask was not lifted from her head by hands, but instead split, and glided in two.

On the stump of her neck sat a rectangular metal box, with no features except for a small yellow smiley sticker in the center as a mockery of a face.

I distinctly remember recoiling, and feeling disgusted.

""Does my true face frighten you?"", she said to me.

I did not answer her; it was so grotesque I could not bring myself to.

I tossed and turned in my bed, and could not fall asleep in the dream.

There were different noises, like cicadas and rain- it seems like I was there for years.

The second dream was of me leaving my house in the rain, and running.

I ran down the street, and saw many people I did not know out walking, some of whom I was afraid to go near.

This somehow turned to a farm, when I realized I was asleep.

Everything went black, and I knew I was laying in my own bed.

I could see the outline of my hand and pillow.

I began to try and move my arm, but could not.

I told myself, ""Breath."" because I was thought I might not be breathing, and felt a chill enter my lungs.

I then tried with all my might to wake up or move, and I saw my arm tear away from itself; like a shadow of it moved and reached out, but left my flesh behind.

This frightened me into waking.

My eyes were heavy, and I knew I was awake.

I couldn't keep my eyes open, and every time they drooped shut, I would hear a strong drone, or the rain, like it was real- but I knew I was still awake.

The sleepiness took me, and my third dream began.

It was a normal dream at first, but then turned to a plane room with wooden floors and no doors.

There were wooden train track blocks and a few other items there, and many hanging nails.

They were at first in a pile, then multiplied to spread the floor in a grid.

There was a boy my age there with me, and we began to talk.

It was so natural, but I don't remember exact words.

I knew I was dreaming at this point, but the odd thing was, the boy told me he was dreaming too, and the conversation turned to ho we shared this purgatory or hell together.

I leaned to do something with the tracks, and felt a prick in my side.

I turned and saw the boy had stuck me near the back with one of the hanging nails.

He just stared at me.
 I took a step back, confused.

Then, the real feeling of uneasiness started when he followed my step, maintaining the space between us.

It progressed very fast after that.

I saw his eyes widen into black sockets, and his mouth gape open- and he gave out a horrible loud drone.

He grabbed me by the arm and neck and pushed me to the floor with ease.

I actually felt his hands, and being thrown!

I shot awake, and my eyes darted to the top of my closet (where there is a bit of light), and then to my shelf.

I could see a texture like the folds of a cloth, or the pedals of a rose on them, imprinted.

It followed wherever I looked where there was light, like when you get a shape burned into your eyes after looking at the sun.

It was all very strange and frightening, and I feel my eyelids ganging again.

I am a little bit scared to go to sleep again.

the picture in my eyes went away after about 10-15 seconds, but during that, I was trying to make out what it was or the meaning of it.

My first thought was that it was the reaper, coming to take me, or to warn me, and my second thought, for whatever reason, was Rose (name of friend).

When I looked back she was already in the middle of the road. I can hear her skull being crushed. It was the worst sound ever. It creeped me out. The cars just kept coming and coming, running over her head over and over again. (Why couldn't they go around her or stop?) Which made me scared to cross over and check up on her. I was thinking, ""why won't they stop running over her? Can't they see her?"" But when I ran up and put my hand up for the incoming cars, they went around me. Her body was deformed and I was so scared to check up on her. I cried so hard, because she was dying. There was blood coming out of everywhere. I can still feel my heart aching. It felt so real.

So each night it starts out i can see myself asleep as if i am astral projecting. Then there comes a voice. I can never make out what it is saying, but i wake up. I get out of bed and leave the room im in. I am in what seems like a labyrinth of a house. I wonder around from room to room but most of the doors are locked and lots of the hallways are dead ends. The first room i come to that is open is empty but i go into it anyways. It has a window and i always go to it. Out side there is a girl standing there but i cant see her face. The voice calls again. I leave the room and wonder around for what seems like days until i get to this one room. Its like i know this is the room i need to go into. Once i open the door i wake up.

One differences in the dreams is the girl. Each night she is somewhere different in the house. But i still cant see her face.

The other is the last room, the girl was standing outside the door of this room last night. Normally when i open this door is when i wake up. But this time i didnt, well not right away. I walk into this room and i see myself again but this time im not sleeping. I see myself dead on the floor and then i woke up.

From ages 5 to about 10, when I would dream they would usually come true within a few days or even a year or two. I remember when I was in fourth grade I had a dream that the girl sitting at the desk across from me was absent the day we had to write a scary story for Halloween. Sure enough two days later she doesn't show up to school and we have to write the story. Lo and behold I'm the only one without a writing partner.

After that point I began only dreaming before bad things would happen to me. I dreamt for a whole month before my first girlfriend killed herself. The day everyone found out was the same day I stopped having dreams. Before I crashed my first car, I dreamt for a week. The night after it happened the dreams stopped.

Nowadays I rarely dream at all, it seems life has finally let me off the leash for a little. I'm with an amazing woman who has started to become another part of me, we're so close we just know what each other is thinking and wants an almost all times. You know, a healthy and happy partnership. 

In this one thing, however, she is my opposite: she dreams nearly every night. Of course, I'm almost always there. The only times I'm not, however, are when I myself have a dream. These only ever last one night at this point, so I'm not gone from her for long.

To me, this has not been ""terrifying"" but it sure has been metaphysical. I never know what a dream is the prelude of, they never really correlate to reality in that sense.

This dark dystopian dreamworld is currently coming to an end. It's Dark gray and ominous in the air (this is how almost all of my dreams are). My sister and I are trying to fly an air balloon to escape the impending doom of America but it's so hard to fly (it has no controls, we must simply follow the wind. The first time we flew it, our plates of food and other belongings flew everywhere immediately because of the relentless wind. Another team of potentially French girls were getting in their apparatus and easily controlled it, but they didn't help us, nor did we ask).

We give up with the air balloon  for now but then a seemingly endless number of long, skinny, pointy bombs flood into our house window, but don't detonate. We look towards the bombs and see that someone in our house is throwing them out of their window and into ours. It's so pristine, like a neat and endless stream of bombs. We can see that the house is collapsing on the bomb-side and it's becoming harder to breathe. We don't have time to find our parents. We have to jump!

We jump out the opposite window, first my younger siblings, then me, then my older brother. I say I love them all and this violent rushing wind outside carries us safely down to the ground,although i thought It'd surely sweep us away, killing us with us ferocity. 

We need to leave this country, so my brother embodies Trump and walks into his office. His ""advisors"" at this point work independently of him and he's Clearly a puppet. They say ""but I thought you gave  us clearance on this (other thing)"". They said it with little energy, feigned interest, and muffled laughter, as though he had lost control years prior. 

>>around this time in my dream, I had other plots going. My brother being wise and giving advice; this white guy thinking his dad had said something, but it was himself in a dream; and all these Egyptian gods going at war in some way. One God released another (Ra, I think). I thought it was so they could join as teammates and fight together, but the releaser simply wanted to do nothing and fled, leaving the others to fight in his place.<<

He (Trump) just wanted to put his family on the moon, away from harm, where there was a seemingly cushy lifestyle: people being fed through tubes in their stomachs and throats. There was then a cut scene to the moon place: people were fine at first, but eventually their bodies had huge irreversible holes (this part looked like a cartoon) from where the tubes entered their bodies. They were grabbing at and showing us their cartoonishly disfigured bodies, hanging skin, and blood. 

I woke up.

We had lunch, went to the conference, talked about our books, then it flashed forward a bit. We were at a nice hotel with a fine indoor pool, so we had a cannonball competition off the low diving board. Trump won. Then he helped me load a van for a cross-country trip, I helped him change a loose hardwood flooboard on his yacht, we had pizza, and he talked about how much he loved my dog. Our discussions got pretty deep after we talked about the dog. He talked about getting older and how much of a bummer it was for a guy like him, how he was scared of dying, and I talked about becoming a parent and how freaky it was. We sympathized, gave input, encouraged each other in our conversation. He fed my dog.

Suddenly, a group of kids came with their bicycles, then the people i was walking with started running. I didn't. “Why run from kids?” I thought. I mean what's going on. They surrounded me and my back was on the wall of the alley, their faces .. they all have the same face! different ages different bodies different clothes different bicycles but the same face! They all had huge millow shaped heads and were bold and have small ears and big rounded eyes with no eyebrows and a huge smile with some teeth showing. They surrounded me. With the shock of their looks I felt the world is turning. They tried to grab me but I managed to get away. I ran to the old house and they were after me right behind. The people I was with were waiting on me by the door and Madi was last. We rushed in and closed the door and looked at each other… The group of kids sat by the door outside surrounding the place. The house is a normal 1970s middle eastern house with tall walls and a metal door. So, we felt we are in the clear. Once we calmed down Madi mentioned something that me and him will die. I didn’t put any weight to what he said not after he cut himself of the world for 4 years because of substance abuse and then got back in touch but he wasn’t the same person. We went inside to the majles, which is the arabic word for the room where men set and socialize. Right beside the majles there’s another majles called majles alnissa, which means women majles. The two rooms are connected by a wide wooden door with plates of glass. I and my three childhood friends were in the majles plus my two young sister, Sara and Reema, they were much younger than what they are. I went to the kitchen through the women majles and Madi followed. We chatted there for a while then he said that he knows the group of kids. They are his brothers. His father has many wives. I was shocked by the fact. Then he repeated what he said earlier that we both will die tonight. He added “You’ll kill me and then you will be killed by me”. I thought “what? What does that mean? How am I going to be killed by already a dead man? He means me harm and he will hurt me but in my slef defense I’ll kill him but I’ll be injured and will die as a result”. At this point I knew that Madi is the enemy. I started making tea and talking about how to make it in the right way. Then, after he got distracted, I smoothly grabbed a big knife that was on the kitchen table. I fastly grabbed his head with my left hand and stabbed him on the neck by the other hand until the blade popped out of the other side of his neck. He fell and I pulled the knife of him. I rushed to the majles while carrying the knife. On the way, while I was walking through the women majles to get to the majles, I saw my other childhood friend, Haider, slicing my youngest sister. I was mortified. I hit him with the knife on the top of his nose but I didn’t go all the way in cutting his face in half. I stopped because I didn’t want him to get off this easy.. this fast. I was furious seeking revenge and wanted to make him suffer. After pulled my knife off his face/nose I took a moment to think. I told myself “ wait.. This cannot be happening. Madi was away and changed but Haider is still my friend who I know very well. Why would he do such a thing?! And my youngest sister is my favorite person in the world she can’t be dead.

I still do not know  anyone in the room and they greet the man I was walking with, he was like a clean cut medium to light skin black dude that seemed like my friend and the guys that arrived were rougher around the edges and white and/or hispanic. They were rougher than the two of us but clearly happy to see us when they rolled up. I finish the phone call and as I am telling the story my Mom makes a comment asking if this is the same place with the $12 cup of coffee, insinuating that she would have to pay for this trip like she did the last one with the expensive coffee. I didn't have time to question how she knew about the coffee or explain that they don't pay for my shit anymore bc we had arrived in the back of the store we had just all entered. I told her I had to go and that I'd call her later in front of everyone and hung up.

0.0,5zdi2g,3.0,2.0,"I had a dream last night that unfortunately I don't remember all of. I'm trying to write it down somewhere people will see it. 

I lived in a house with my girlfriend. It had two floors and the upstairs was in pretty severe disrepair. When I went up there I saw a small figure with gold glowing eyes steadily approaching me and growing larger. Suddenly it lunged at me. I hit it and it retreated. But it quickly started approaching me again and this this time I couldn't touch it. To escape it I jumped out the window behind me. Whenever I walked around my house I could see the thing through the windows looking at me and growing. 

I found out that my house was the local haunted house legend our town had. They had a name for the ghost that lived there but I can't remember it. The person who's ghost it was was named Winona Ryder. I wanted to go back home and tell my girlfriend but as I approached the windows on the ground floor I saw Winona. She had replaced the figure. She was actually quite beautiful. Very pale with wavy black hair that reached down to her chest and the small of her back. She wore all black. She grinned at me and then her fave rapidly shifted through several other shapes. She seemed depressed, then angry, then scared, then she went through a range of shapes faces shouldn't be able to contort into in an attempt I think to terrify me. She kept yelling something. I thought she was saying ""I hate you"" but the fourth time she said ""I need paper"". She found a pen and pad and wrote out a list of demands which were to be carried out in four hours or ""something bad"" would happen. I don't know how I got the paper, but it was in my hands and I was leaving. But I never did the demands. I spent the next day with family at a theater and they all made fun of me for some reason. When I said I had met Winona though, they all went quiet. One of them asked if I was serious that I had met her but called her by the local nickname. I nodded and looked at the house and saw her through the window. She was furious I think. 

Suddenly the dream changed and I was in the house, but the house was on fire. I had a daughter and a wife. The wife was trying to run away from me but she was going to fall out of the window on the second floor. I tried to save her but she kept clawing at me and screaming in this otherworldly way. I wouldn't leave her though, I loved her. My daughter escaped my arms and tried to help her mom, she must have been six. Her mother swiped at her too and cut her badly on the face. Then I was the daughter and my mother changed to this horrifying skeletal creature with glowing red eyes howling at me. I wanted to help her but she wouldn't let me close. Then I was the mother and I saw my daughter and this burning thing trying to push her at me. It screamed and shoved it's flaming face into mine and I realized that it was my husband. I had been fighting my husband and daughter, not monsters. I fell and my husband burned. My daughter caught fire and then jumped after me. When we got the ground I didn't move for some time. And my daughter kept walking around me. Her feet seemed...Gone. Like she was walking on bloody stumps but she could still walk just fine. I told her I was diagnosed with something a long time ago. I kept saying it was ""scabies"" and that it made me crazy. My daughter cried and asked why I had never gotten help. I told her because I was scared and that if I had scabies she did too because it was genetic. She put on shoes and started walking. She was wearing a little black dress and had longish black hair. Without pain or effort I got up and started following her. The world started to flicker. It would shift from normal to rotting and covered with worms and insects, all writhing and chittering. She asked me what she was seeing. I told her to stay strong, to remember it isnt real. It got me it didn't have to get her too. She picked up a very long worm as I told her I would always be with her now and she'd have me. Whenever the world changed the trees would turn to worms, the ground would be covered in beetles, and the worm she picked up would be dead and rotting. But we stayed the same. I fell silent. She walked all the way to the center of town where she thought she saw police cars and firetrucks everywhere. Flashing lights overwhelmed her even though when the world shifted back it was just a few cars, an ambulance, and a police car. They got out and asked her why she was all alone and if she was okay. She screamed and backed away from them, then she demanded blood. People slowly started pushing or hitting each other. Someone threw another child at her, a boy a bit older than her. She bit him and laughed. The town broke into a riot and she stood at the center before turning to me, not the mother or dream me but me in real life and smirked. Then the dream ended. 

I have no idea what it means, if anything. I had a compulsion to write this down. I've never recorded a dream. I know I probably forgot half of it, and I've never lucid dreamed. I had a few ideas as to what some parts were about but I can't tell always if that's my brain making logical pieces to fill in the gaps or what truly is the dream. Lastly, I wanted to give a little bit of explanation that the dream doesn't make inherently clear unless you dreamed it. Just stuff I knew while I was there that was never said. 

The house on fire was my house in the past. 
The daughter was Winona.

Sometimes when im tired or sometimes in a half-conscious dream I have the feeling where that happens but intensifies, i always get so scared that I snap out of it,  you feel your consciousness or Im guessing your ego, slip away.

   So i have three dogs (males) and two of them are in my posession by an unwilling choice, but they are like my kids so i cant get rid of them. I have them because my ex cant afford to take care of them. Well one is an absolute fucking dumb fucking anxious cunt and the other is a no fuck giving, disrespectful inquisitive piece of shit.
   I love animals, dont get me wrong, but these two get to me in a way like no other (i think its because of the relationship with my ex). The third is older and ive had him longer so he knows his place, he is cool.      So these two always get into shit and destroy my shit when i go to work. When i leave the two fucktards out side nothing gets fucked up, but occasionally it rains, so i cant leave them in the cold and rain. 
  Well... i had a great day at work, got home they fucked shit up and managed to get out of the gate through a hole the inquisitive POS made, so i chased them, retrieved them, and then it got time for bed. I turned on a resonance of 936mhz ( long story ) and fell asleep. It didnt feel long til i woke up, but i was a puppy (absolutely fucking bizarre) with complete chaos going around me, i could not tell at all what was happening for the life of me. So i try to change my mind set, which i am capable of doing even in the most stressful and critcal situations, and think outside of the box away from FAE (Fatal Attritube Error) nope, couldnt, there was this fear that took over. I was tremblimg, litterally ready to cry, could only focus on that feeling, could not for the life of me focus on anything else, like being trapped in an elastic buble full of syrup. Just FEAR, mind you ive have dealt with my EGO and my Id, im able to put them aside, but i have never felt this fear, this raw emotion,  the sensation i felt when ive only experienced death itself. It felt like it was a couple years, i was tormentwd, but couldnot fogure out or let alone see what was going on out side of my ""bubble"".
   And then i woke up. Cursing like the infantryman i am, probably waking up my neighbor. Scared the living hell out of my dogs. The rage and anger that i felt waking up was enough for me to take down the wall i sleep next to. 
  After the understanding i was awake, through about a 5 minute ordeal of not knowing what was going on and trying to fight that fear and be stronger than it. I was able to change my mindset, and fall asleep fairly quick to no sounds, just silence. I woke up, went to work and was disturbed. i have an ""almost important"" job and all i could think about was why. What was the reason. The causality. The (to me) singularity i couldnt reach with psilocybin (even after high doses), the effects of a resonance that i didnt even wake up to (tablet screen was asleep) so i know it wasnt playing. That means, by direct deduction, it wasnt playing while i was dreaming, so the tune played and i dreamed after, well after. (me thinking back)
  Anyways, i saw the two POS' when i got home from work, and felt a great feeling and a flash of the ""dream"" and hugged them, gave them treats, and have been nice. That was two days ago, their rules still apply, but when they fuck up like tearing up my gardening shit today, i actually rejected the feeling of electrified anger i usually feel. I felt ok with it, didnt bother me. I cleaned up and went on.

While my mind associates the dreams with real people and places, these specific sites are nothing like their real word counterparts nor are the people anything like what I dreamt them to be. Last night, the latter proved true as I dreamt myself in the KC Royals Stadium.

The dream started with the end of the game. I did not see a final score nor did I see the team the Royals were playing. My attention was set more so on the skyscraper in which the stadium was built in. It was majestic with its blue-gray glassy pane and it felt like it rose above all else by at least 50 stories. With that in mind, it seemed as though it was built in a downtown area rather than the remote location of the current stadium. 

But what stood out the most was this structure that was built on top of the skyscraper. The structure was this pronounced office building where the ""big man's chair"" could be seen through the central window of the second story. When I saw it, it was as though I was hovering above it all. Seeing myself back in the skyscraper, I had to reach it.

As I struggle to make my way higher and higher, everybody else around me was trying to make their way to the bottom. As I climbed higher and higher, the shops and food stands captivated my interest, especially among the higher floors where it seemed as though their presence would go unnoticed.

I reached as high as I could, only to realize that one, specific escalator could take me to it. As I looked on, I woke up with a feeling of awe.",hot,A Magnificent Skyscraper,2.0

I was 18 at the time in the summer maybe late June. I was vacationing with my girlfriend, her grandma, her aunt, and a few other relatives I couldn't wait to meet. We were staying in a log cabin in West Virginia and as you would expect it was in the middle of the woods maybe about an hour drive away from civilization. As we drives down the dirt path my heart was racing I was getting too excited because this was the first time I went on vacation I got to go to without a single family member of mine being there as we reach the log cabin we were greeted by the other family members of my girlfriends other aunt and her grandchildren with them just two sisters 
The oldest one was named Jenny who I liked to call shortcake and youngest and most spoiled was Melissa the aunts name well we'll just call her Sarah, she was never to fond of me and I could never really understand why. The cabin was surrounded by trees for miles and I was amazed because I never been this deep into the forest before so I decided to run a bit further I got to a path that was surrounded by two hills and I was feeling adventurous at the time so i wasn't really worried if I'd run into a bear or whatever lurked out in the woods I made up about halfway up the tall steep hill I ran about of breath but was happy then about a few moments later I heard my name being called so of course as the obedient man I am I rushed back and we all had a blast we had a nice lunch for some fire wood, I got stung by a few yellow jackets and made s'mores it was a great day. By then it was almost bitch black out so when the fire ran out we went back inside. We had a generator out back connecting to the house powering up the cabin so when the generator went off it was time for bed. But as soon as it went off I had a good idea In my head it be a perfect time to tell scary stories and I had my phone on me and I used the flashlight app and pointed it at my face for your typical time to tell a scary story cliché and I remember a story Sarah told me about this log cabin it was your typical beating husband wife cheated on him he killed them both and himself and haunts the cabin so I'd thought it be fun to tell the same story and man did it scared them especially my girlfriend who decided it was time to get some sleep and I agreed. 
So we all got into bed as the non family member I got a bed of my own on the other side of the small cabin while everyone shared a bed. After what felt like hours I finally went to bed. I'm one of those it's hard for me to fall asleep when I'm in and unfamiliar place but I managed somehow. But that night I've had one of the worst dreams I've ever had in my life and I remember every detail.

I awoke  In an unfamiliar place where you could see nothing but trees and the only source of light was the full moon and I ventured out acting brave but deep down I wanted to puke I was so terrified but I caught a glimpse of a girl in a white dress or at least half of her because she was hiding behind a tree eyeballing me "" Hey"" I shouted but no response I walked towards the girl but every step I took it seemed I was getting further and further away then out of the blue she started to run away and I was taking after her ""Hey wait a minuet don't leave me here alone"" I pleaded but she kept running and o remember getting tired I couldn't keep up and I fell on my knees gasping for air but then I blacked out and I awoke in the cabin but it was bigger than before and abandoned. My girlfriend and her family were no where in sight ""They're gone but where did they go"" I whispered to myself so I being to search the cabin, there were no beds no cloths cabinets or anything the cabin as empty except for the kitchen area all the chairs firdge table and food was still in there and it puzzled me then at that moment I heard slight whispers coming form below ""Maria baby is that you"" I called out and as soon as I did the whispers stop and there was a long pause of silence but then that was interrupted by a bang coming from the floor by that point I was scared shirtless and as soon as I collided with the floor by jumping out of fear a small hatch opened and I began to crawl near The open hatches and as I I looked down I noticed a ladder that lead down the bottomless pit deep inside I was telling m self not to but I did it anyway and as I reached bottom I found myself in a tunnel not one of those underground dirt tunnels no it was a slimy red tunnel that kept goin and seemed like there was no end. I wanted to get out of there as quickly as I could but when I turned around the hatch and ladder was gone so I had no choice but to continue forth as I walked Down the slimy rubble I begin to hear whispering I distinctly remember hearing a voice say shh he's here and it stopped next thing I know I hear my name being called and as I turned my head where the voice was coming from I was shocked who I saw. It was one of coworkers back at home "" Kim?"" I called out I was so relieved to see a familiar face but strange why she was in my dream, as she signaled me to come over I didn't hesitate I hated being alone as I ran toward her she went around the corner as did I but as I did it was all pitch black "" Kim? KIM where'd you go"" and just as I said it a match was lit and there Kim's face was signaling me to shh ""Kim where are we?"" I asked and what happened next I can never forget it it scares me to this day "" she foooooound us "" she said with a demonic laugh following and as I turned around there was the little girl but way different her eyes were hollow blacker than the night itself her body parts severed but floating where they're originally suppose to be her dress covering her body her arms and legs shaking in place and the most ear piercing scream you can imagine followed by mine. I ran in the opposite direction but I didn't get far as I tripped over the corpses of my dead girlfriend and her family as I looked up her head was eye to eye with mine still screaming here moth opens wide and lunges towards me and then nothing but darkness.

Finally I awoke so struck by fear I couldn't move an inch and the sound of a ticking clock wasn't helping me and I stayed awake still the sun showed

I tried telling everyone but all they told me was I scared myself with the scary stories I told last night but I know that wasn't it at all

In the start it was a regular dream full of regular weird things, such as: dog sleighing, where the last dog is running backwards for some reason, but looking happy as hell; driving around the city in a friend's car or your other friend being very angry and upset about something so he regularly over some time punches his fists against something that is not very soft, let's say a lamp post and a concrete wall. But things were getting weirder, the angry boy, let's name him Jack, was starting to get angrier and angrier, he began hitting the car instead of the city's property, luckily, those were only soft punches rather than full on kicks.
But things were repeating like flashbacks, a bit of dog sleighing, friend hitting the car, we driving the car and so on and so forth. Suddenly, the chain was broken and it was a completely new ""flashback"", we were near the shops in the town i live in, but somewhy my other friend, let's name him Dave, stopped driving on the road between the shops. Suddenly, who i thought to be Jack, punched the right side mirror so hard it broke, he then hit the window and i saw that it was not Jack, but a short, but strong guy. At that moment, Dave opened his door and ran, but as the angry man was on the right, i had to go over the gearstick in order to get out from the left. I held my iPad in my hand and were backing off, until i saw that there was another guy with the one who broke the window and they immediately started to take car parts apart. I ran as quickly as I could, seeing that the shorter guy was following me as fast as i was running, I began to call for help, but i had no voice, my throat was completely dry and there was not a single word, letter or noise coming out. I ran past a group of 3 guys, who i then heard were jokingly mumbling if i was running away from someone, but a second later they saw that it wasn't a joke. At this point, i still didn't have my voice, but a police officer came towards me and i tried to yell for help as hard i ever could, no voice... Suddenly i woke up, twisted 90 degrees in my bed and trying to yell for help, but my throat and mouth were dry, i immediately fell asleep after that.

 I've been having these dreams, for about six years now. They don't happen every night, in fact they only happen a couple times a year and I can probably still recall every one I've had

 I'll explain what the dreams are in a moment, but first I want to make it clear that this biggest part of this to me is the actual feeling associated with these dreams. I have a rather extensive vocabulary, I mean I'm not an English graduate or anything but I have enough words in my back pocket to usually explain any feeling or experience I've had quite precisely. However it frustrates me so much, because no matter how much I rack my brain I cannot come up a description for this feeling. Maybe warm, maybe nostalgic but if it is nostalgic than it's a different type of nostalgia than I've ever experienced. 

 Anyway, there's a couple different settings to these dreams, I'm not sure if they're connected or if I feel this strong feeling after them for a different reason but I'll start with the 'mill' dreams. 

 The first one I had sticks to me the most. I remember I was walking through 'aisles' of soil, seriously it was like someone cut out rows, just a bit taller than my head to make hallways leading through the dirt. The most disturbing part of this first dream though was that there were body parts sticking out of the sides of the aisles, with dresses and clothes that's looked to be 1940-50s style.

 I've tried to draw this multiple times. I'm still trying to get it right 

 I'm not sure the exact order of the next dreams, but I know that they're not exactly recurring dreams, more like dreams where I get to explore a little more each time

 To get to the place I know I gave to go through a fairly sparse forest, I think it's fall, too. Must be an environment I know. And I have to walk across a log crossing a really fast river. The log looks like it would be too thin to hold me at the end. I never remember actually walking up to the building(and rows of bodies) but it must be close to the river.

 Beside the body dump, there's a broken down, maybe burnt building with grey rotting blocks on the outside. And it seems more put together on the inside

 The top floor is open to the outside, with only a few stone collums holing it up. The floor right under is really dusty, with a warm yellow light in a still stone room. I go down a makeshift ladder sent to get to another floor and things get damp really quick

 The floor under is really wet, dark and kind of cold. I feel like there's rats running around somewhere and I can't really see more than a few feet in front of me. I wander around and then the dream ends

 A few more dreams pass, I explore a few floors like this but mostly start to have my other strong feeling dreams. I won't explain much about them other that I can remember (and draw out) a street in front of a forest, as well as a school hallway where I'm looking out into again, a forest. 

 The last 'mill' dream I had, I remember I was in what seemed like the bottom floor, there was a dirt ground and the rooms felt dusty like the first. I'm looking down a sort of hallway, with wood supports holding the dirt room up, a small black rectangle at the end that I think is my next destination.

 I really can't explain these. I can't find an explanation online, either. I'm finding myself more and more distracted by what may not even be reality

 And the feeling I get after these dreams, it's been months and I can still feel it like it's yesterday. I've almost convinced myself these are memories from a past life or something like that

 Nobody understands what this is, people laugh and say 'oh I know' when I talk about these dreams but I don't have to words to make anyone understand how I feel. Maybe someone on here will understand, maybe not. Maybe I have to figure this out myself.

0.0,5efjvf,1.0,1.0,"So. Yes. This happens to me too.
It started a year ago with my dreams having memories of their own. And it was not just memory, it is like my dreams still carry on with their plot even when I'm awake, or even if I haven't seen the sequel of the dream on a long time. It sometimes happens so, that the dream has some sort of projection in a completely unrelated one, too. 
For example, a year ago I dreamt that Id gone to a beach with a few friends. We clicked a picture, that I saw on the camera screen.  About 4- 5 months later, without having any continuation of this dream, I met a friend who gave me the printout of the same identical picture. And I replied with, ""Thanks man, here's the money for the print."" suggesting I'd asked him to print it but I had no memory of it. Then it gets even weirder. 
About 3 months ago. I had a completely unrelated dream, where I was heading out of my house. I took my helmet and my key from the shelf. And I saw that same picture inside a frame. It was sitting there. And I knew it. In the dream, that I'd put it there. I just knew it. 
Another is, I saw a dream a long time ago where I went shopping for a wedding. I bought this white dress. Then a few weeks ago. I saw myself attending an unknown wedding reception, wearing that same dress. And yesterday. I saw myself bring it back k from the dry cleaners. And all three dreams were not about each other but had only a certain portion of it in common. Like the dreams would be of completely different subjects but these minor details will connect them all together. It's like in my subconscious, my dreams carry on parallely, even if I'm awake, or even if I am seeing different dreams.  But then since a few weeks. Really weird stuff has started to happen. I am a very light sleeper. And I am always aware if I'm dreaming. Always. It's not something that I try to do. But while dreaming, I always know If I'm dreaming. I either have dreams like those, or have dreams I can't remember come morning. Like I'd have an intense dream where I'd not know I'm dreaming. But when I wake up, I'll know I wasn't lucid but I'll not be able to recollect the dream either. But if I'm lucid, then I always remember the dream. 
My school ended a month ago. And every day I forget to cancel my morning alarm. So I'll be dreaming, lucidly, if I don't dream lucid then this doesn't happen. 
So I'm in a lucid dream. I don't necessarily modify my dream much. Unless I'm in a nightmare, then I make myself wake up. I don't really care what I'm dreaming about. So I don't put any effort of modification, I just go along with the dream. Knowing that it is one.
Then at 6 AM the alarm rings, I momentarily wake up, dismiss the alarm, and go back to sleep instantly. Instantly. And that's when it happens. And disclaimer? It's not lucid anymore, only once after I wake up, do I realize it was a dream. And it's the only non-lucid dream that I remember. 

I wake up in this city. I never know how I got there. I wake up in this same city. And I know all the roads and ways. And I do pretty normal stuff there. Suggesting that it's a city I live in now. It's constructed with the utmost details. But I can guarantee it's not a place I've ever been or seen. And I don't think a place like that exists either. Because the place had a sort of Greco-spaniard architecture, mixed with some east European architecture. But it has tons and tons of palm trees. The roads suggest that the place is hilly. And the streets are tiled, except for the main roads. The weather is cold enough, I'm always cold. But the place has palm, or palm like trees. Every thing is super detailed, even the overhead road sign boards. I hear traffic but I don't see any ever. I barely meet people, and when I do they're mostly people I don't know. And I can never remember the conversations I have with them. I know I take a lot of time talking to them if I do. But I never remember the substance of those talks. But I remember looking at them while talking and it feels like, I feel like I informing them of something and it's like an interrogation. I'm not scared. Not in the least bit. And it's very apparent that I live there. Since 4 weeks or so. Anything that happens after the 6 AM alarm, happens in that city. The dreams are pretty unrelated now and I don't have instances of continuity anymore. Or anything that's notable. Except for the interrogations. They always take place in a deserted street of the city.

First time posting under this section. I'm posting on here in hopes someone understands or can help with what my dream is saying to me. Last night I had a dream I was inside a house that I did not recognise and there was several people in it, but I do not recall who and why they were there. The thing I mostly remember is 2 different birds chasing me around the house and occasionally pecking me with their beak. I can not tell you how long this lasted as it seemed forever, but the 2 birds differ in size and beak length. 1 bird looked like a kookaburra and the other I don't know what type of bird it was. From what I can recall it was walking with 2 orangish legs and a long orangish beak and I believe the body was all white. This bird was the most agressive bird ever and when it pecked, but, etc I could feel the pain. I was scared in my dream and that's when I took up arms. Anyways, I killed the little bird (kookaburra) with a book after awhile. It was very gruesome in my dream and the 2nd bird (this one was the one that really pissed me off), I vividly remember nailing this bird a good 7 times in the head till it to was bloody. I'm not sure why I had this dream.

I posted some time ago about my 2nd break up with a girl. We were really close for 1.5 years, broke up, came back together this year but broke up again. In both cases it was her, saying she didn't feel it anymore.

After the break up in August, I didn't dream anything related to her. Random, weird dreams.

However, some 7 days ago, things made a 180° turn. Since then, I had 3 dreams of her, of which 2 were very similar.

The first two dreams were of me sitting in a room, often surrounded by people which are important to me. There friends during the first, family members during the second. I was unable to identify where I exactly was, but it usually looked comfy and nice.

In both dreams, my ex appears, standing, and looks at me expectantly. She looked quite sheepish during the second. She said nothing. Ofc both dreams ended without a solid conclusion.

The third dream was different. I was sitting in front of a building I don't know (but everytime I think about it, it feels important). My ex appears with her father with the intent of going in. She appears very surprised, probably also a bit shocked, that I am there. As if I waited for them.

I should note that I have a hard time letting go off her. She dumped me twice, but she is also a person who is young, inexperienced and very unsure of what she wants. And she regretted and paid dearly emotionally for the first break up.

For starters, let me mention that all of my dreams are incredibly realistic. I can smell and feel everything. Everything from the wrinkles in someone's shirt to the reflection in their eyes are perfect. Even every hair on their bodies are exact.

The one I'm going to tell you was from a couple years ago, but I can still remember every detail.

One moment I was walking down the sidewalk. It was a normal day, nothing abnormal. I started to feel lightheaded, and I felt like I was spinning. Everything went black.

What happened between then and now is a complete mystery. I don't know what I did, I don't know where I am. I'm in a cement room. The floor is all tile and there is blood soaking the floor around a single metal chair. Across from the chair is a mirror. I can see myself in it. 

I'm not in the chair, I'm looking in the mirror smiling. My hair is tangled and messy. I have a smile spread across my face so far that in order to keep my eyes open, I have to bug them out. There's blood covering my clothing. A lot of it is dry, but there is fresh blood on my face and chest.

I feel like I'm watching myself, with no control of my body. I watch as I lure someone into the room. They look confused and terrified. How did I get him there? I lead him over to the metal chair, and that's when I see it. I have a massice knife in my hands, holding it against his back. 

It has to be 7 or 8 inches at least. I move him to the chair that's bolted into the tile, and I handcuff both of his wrists to the chair. Then I continue to tye his body to the chair so it can't move. 

I still have a massive smile on my face, and I can see that the man is terrified, too terrified to speak. I watch myself look over the man's shoulder, looking for confirmation.

In the corner is a man, or something like it. It stands like a man, but it's face is something different. It looks like it's face is partially melted, with the eyes and mouth cut out, jagged. 

I want to yell at myself to stop whatever I'm going to do, but instead, all I can do is watch myself get the confirmation from the thing in the corner, and raise my knife to the man's face. 

As I smile, I begin cutting into the side of the man's face, cutting a joker smile into it, then proceeding to cut holes in his cheeks to represent dimples.

I force him to watch as I butcher his face into a demented smile, knowing that everytime he smiles now, he'll be forced to remember this moment.

I'm screaming at myself to stop, but I don't listen. 

That's when things begin to clear up though, when whatever the thing in the corner is, shows me what is really happening.

I'm in a public bathroom, I'm alone. I'm holding the knife not to a man, but to my own face. I'm cutting a smile and dimples into my face. As I grin at myself, and blood soaks my own shirt.

I'm delusional, and I can't stop myself...

Well hi this is my second post ever on reddit and the last post mixed with this post will probably make you think I am crazy, heck i might be without me knowing but that is beside the point.

So here i go:

A little while back about 2 months ago i had this crazy vivid dream of me and some really close friends partying (I never have these kinds of dreams) on an boat somewhere i don't know about in RL.

In the dream it felt like i was on that boat for a few hours before water started to flow in fast as f*ck, then i saw her, the most beautiful girl ever (a 5/10 I recon most people would say, but a 20/10 for me) 
I got the warmest feeling in my ches, at that moment i got the strongest will to live, she was the missing link in my life.

I ran to her and she just took a strong hold on my sweater and said ""follow me!"" Ofc i did and we went through something that looked like a hole in the hul covered by drapes and on the other side was something that reminded me of the shire without all the homes expect one house, we went towards it.

At that moment it felt like a god damn utopia, we talked for something that felt like hours and then out of nowhere a bunch of guys came.

They had masks on and they had that bloodlust that would make anyone shiver, we ran and suddenly i had a sword in my hands and so did she i swung my sword straight at the masked guys but the girl was infront of me even tho we were back to back 1 second ago, i hit her, i remember the feeling of all the will to live in me just vanish when she dropped and i slumped over her and started screaming of how sorry i was while choking on my tears.

And that is when i woke up in a panic with the worst feeling you could imagine just crying in bed for a good 30 min.

But there is one thing I cannot shake that is the fact that I have the strongest feeling of love for this girl and the fact that I somehow know i will meet her again...

Now the starting point can be anywhere it seems the dream is dimensional, and lucid in being able to feel but not alter. The dream has a story but I never get to finish it. Regardless the dream will open somewhere on earth with someone's child being snatched up and taken away, and I'm seeing through the eyes of the parent or guardian figure. The child is seen being taken into a cold abandon building by a huminoid figure. It is always rainy, or dark in this dream and so the guardian figure, which as of late has been a City Detective, A Country Mom, Lastly a Suburban Dad always go in search of said child in the rain and dark. They come across the building of which they enter. Upon entering they are in the lobby of a old 30's- 40's insane asylum lobby, electricity working but nobody present. They almost always see the rainy footprints leading right down a dark descending hallway, they never choose to walk through the front lobby double doors, and I've never seen what's on the left. They also seem to be locked in the Asylum unable to escape now, almost if they were lured in. So the Guardian figure that I'm seeing all of this through descends down the hall, the first room is dimly lit, shadows as if people moving in the background, There is nothing here. They keep on going and descending down this stairwell like hallway, they then come across this room piled high with dismembered bodies, how livid, tland these bodies are being consumed by 2 gluttonous mouths but the bodies never stop piling up, the entire room is a shade of red presumably from the blood. The gluttonous mouths never notice the Guardian so the Guardian climbs over the body piles and continues in search of their child, they go a room deeper which expands into this giant hall where you can't see the ceiling not because it's pitch black but because it's tall, this room is filled with giant delapitated stone pillers. In every instance there are creatures just outside the sides of the pillar rows and it's good to stay in between. Now here's the catch, none of the Guardian have made it beyond this room as I usually wake up, the Country mom thought she heard the voice of her child and was lured outside the pillar row and mulled and cut up, chainsaw in pieces by lanky tall, demonic Chainsaw welding Clown Zombie men. The Suburban dad tried fleeing back to the to the lobby, he was then torn apart by the Gluttonous mouths, ripped in half, and then replaced as a dead body on the piles of bodies as if reappearing from thin air. The Detective I don't know what happened to him, the last I seen was him bursting to tears and collapsing on the floor in the pillar room, two scenarios then happen, either I wake up on a cold sweat or the dim fire lamp lights in the pillar room go out and the detective then looks down the pillar room to go deeper.

0.0,4rml1w,2.0,1.0,"Since I was little I have been dreaming about a girl. A girl that I'm in love with. She has long dark hair. Dosent smile often just when I'm around her and when she is happy other then that she always has a mature serious expression. She dosent dress fancy she dosent act like she is the center of attention. She always has on a white tanktop with a letter jacket and blue jeans or black skinny jeans. She has on dark black regular boots,  long black boots that girls wear, or even shoes that she is conformable in and can run in them. When she enters a room not everyone notices her because she dosent stand out but if you do pay attention to her you are instantly in love with her. She has that look of incense and caution. When you approach her she will turn you down amd you will think she is stuck up or rude, just because she dosent want to have anything to do with anyone. But she is the nicest person ever. She would never lie always honest extremly smart. She's a fighter never gives up and knows how to act in every situation. She has a tattoo but it's not visible so you can never see it. She has a soft voice but with authority. 
If been dreaming about her since I was little and everytime she tells me one day we will meet. I belive it with all my heart that I will meet her. That's why I have such a hard time finding attraction to other girls or anyone at all. Because of her I do not know why I'm so attracted to her when I've never met her. The thing is, i know that one day I will find her and she will know everything about me right when she sees me and I will know her story too without saying a word. We want have to say a single word and we will know who the other person is. One day when I see her I will finally see her face that fave that I've been waiting for so long to see. Everytime I dream of her it feels like realty I can have a conversation with her I can see her face feel her touch. But once I wake up she is gone I can't seem to remember her face it becomes blury the only things I can recall is the way she is dressed the way her body looks the way she talks smiles I can tell you everything about her except for her name and face.

I wish to discuss the Sun Girl, a repeatable girl appearing through my dreams. It's getting real sick.

Originally the Sun Girl was a real girl I used to hang out with a lot 4-6 years ago (can't remember correctly) and I'm so tied with her (meaning meeting her changed me a lot I suppose)
I've never been in a relation ship with her. She was just so.. distant.. I suppose that these years I fell in love with her madly that I even connected the word Love with her, like, the image in your head.
Through the years, I used to dream about her.. not frequently, it was more of a random dreams.. I remember probably the first dream, where she appeared on a party, grabbed me and told me to go dance with me. Then I woke up.
Eventually me and the Sun Girl began to speak, I went my own way - but I was now different.. I knew what I want in life I guess.. but she would still appear in my dreams - it was like.. whenever I began to forget her, the dream reminded me. I gave her the name ""Sun Girl"" because in reality, she had these long, blonde hair.. they reminded me of the sun, also she is the zodiac sign of a leo who is ruled by the Sun.

Two years ago, I met a girl - but at the same day, the Sun Girl contacted me and we spoke a lot - she felt open this time, more discussive with me. In the end I began relationship with the other girl, and the Sun Girl was always these for me.. but only for a time. She abandoned me and now feels alien as much as before, but despite my efforts to forget her, she is still running in my brain.

So what's the thing? 

Despite the real Sun Girl, this dream Sun Girl is always in my dreams. Sometimes she appears twice in a row, sometimes she appears once a month, but she always appears. I decided that thinking about her a lot is very bad and I just have to forget her - and guess what? My subconciousness trolled me - just today I woke from a dream where I was with her. I went to her house (I dream about that place a lot lately) where I began the relation with her and I was just so happy to be with her. I was moving through her house because I like to observe a new flat a lot, but she denied me and told me to stay in the room with the doors (don't understand why, probably her alien nature). Despite that, I realized in that dream I have to end the relationship with my current girlfriend with whom I am for 2 years nearly, I knew she would be sad but didn't bother.... Right that second, I woke up.

I woke up angry. Angry like never before. I hate that dream. I hate dreaming about her all the time. I need explanation.

It looked like it was gaining speed running towards me. That thing stretched its arms towards me, like it wanted me.

This vision occurred when I was four years old and in a fever pitch. I was dreadfully ill, hot and cold, and drenched in sticky sweat, with my internal organs cramping up terribly.
Under the instructions of my parents I was consuming plenty of liquid mixed with juice concentrate. A questionable medicine, and not something the ancients would've used I'm sure.
I was mostly bound to the sofa save my trips to get liquid, and I believe the television was on obediently harassing my young and once innocent spirit. 
I lay there under a colourful woven blanket really paying no mind to the TV, and thrashing ferverently and thrashing in poisoned agony when suddenly it hit.
The room which could've been no more than 6x8m suddenly bloomed into a grand banqueting hall, with statues and statuettes lining the hall. The walls were decorated with ornate golden basques and trellices, and hung with rich tapestries, no doubt from antiquity, and no doubt priceless (for your eyes only kind of thing).
Placed centrally in the room was the banqueting table, this of course in keeping with the rest of the room was extremely lavish, probably redwood oak. Exquisitely carved, and with the capacity to seat two or three hundred people.
The crowning glory of the room (or at least what I thought was the crowning glory) was the ginormous cut crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. Uncountably tiered, and constructed from thousands upon thousands of individually cut crystal pieces hanging majestically like the diamond studded dress of some young ballroom queen.
Now I'd happened upon this room with my extras senses and the vision with all it's details presented in hyper real high definition soaked indelibly into my brain within a split second. At the tender young age of four the sight of such grandeur and beauty left me awestruck, but now that I'm of age I see it for what it really is... Repugnant.
The trail of bloodshed and war that must've been carved through the populous to requisition such prize treasures would've been all too vast.
No sooner had I lapped up the sumptuous details of the hall when out of nowhere the ceiling where the chandelier hung split open, and through the split fell a classic luxury Rolls-Royce! Patel blue paint finish and chrome trims.
The heaving chunk of expensive metal smashing straight into the even more expensive chandelier, obliterating it and sending the crystals flying everywhere. The two structures spiraling downwards into the red oak table! A divine trinity of destruction! Metal, crystal and wood entangled in a cosmic interplay of complete annihilation! 
Naturally this vision scared the wits from my skin and my level of fear shot through the roof. I began to scream as loud as my little lungs could manage, which I imagine was very loud in this heightened state.
My parents responding to my anguished cries rushed into the front room to console me, but to me in this envisioned state they appeared as two green aliens. Their bulbous black eyes taking up most of the space on their face, and their abnormally long fingers probing around in mine. The sight of these strangers in a room completely alien to me caused the level of fear to to intensify and my screaming to rise further. 
The screaming continued until the vision faded and the room returned to normal. I lay there exasperated, breathing heavily with my heart beating in my chest like a pneumatic drill.

So that was my first ever vision at four years old and very ill. Any ideas on the symbology of the vision? I have my own interpretation but would like to hear other peoples ideas. Also has anyone else had similar waking hallucinatory experience whilst being awake?",hot,The first vision!,2.0

I was in some modern city, somewhere and it was 20x7. Don't remember the year carefully but it was 2017/27/37. Most likely 27. 
It was a nice family holiday I was in, we were in hotel, me, my sister, my mum and dad.
We went out toured the city, of which I don' remember much about. At night we met a really asshole guy that was pranking and bullying everyone. So few people along with my dad made a group to hunt this guy down and take him to police station. 
I was in too, so we started to explore the place,  then I was suddenly in the ""Central Park"". That's all I remember about park. It's name. 
So In park I saw that guy, called my dad and few other people, who were around and they all came rushing. That guy started to run , I managed to catch him, and got into scuffle. It was apparent I was losing, he then threw me really hard against the wall, I dislocated my jaw and got bleeding from my head. Though I felt no pain, but I couldn't speak at all, my mouth felt really big and sore. 
Afterwards the group cached him, then dragged him to station, I left towards the nearest clinic on my own. 
On the way I saw my dad, he said he was going back to hotel with family and then preparing for our tomorrow's trip. I was like okay, then I went to clinic where I met a small girl. She was horrified at my injury and started to call the nurse, nurse put me into a bed then did few things and just like that I was all fine, but really tired, so I slept.

Next thing I know there's an alarm blazing, and no one is in the clinic anymore. I see on television that I earthquake frequency have increased alot in all the equator, and how almost all the volacano's are ready to explode. I run out and see people rushing, I rush towards hotel, and see rest of my family. Just as I am about to reach them horrible earthquake comes, ground shakes, and alot of the ground just goes downward, collapsing on itself, I somehow make to my family then we rush towards to some kind of seaport. We meet that asshole guy there too, but he was now helping out other people. Anyways we were supposed to take some kind of vehicle towards Arctic.

Next thing I remember is being separated from rest of my family and was asking other people have they seen my family around. I was in a boat towards arctic nearing the destination. I see some giant pipes on the way, I was told that this was America's protection system, but the earthquake's started to come way earlier than expected so this project was scrapped. People were supposed to live in these pipes, and travel. They were really high up in sky and the rods supporting them were really thick too.

Then next scene happens and I am inside a city, people are rushing jumping down trying to find their rooms asap. I look around and see my room, and go there. 
It's pretty big and house like, I got 3 other mates who I share with and we all have our own room. Then suddenly everything shakes, alarm blazes again and we are summoned to the top of the tower. As we reach the top of the tower I see that our tower is now joined with some kind of space craft and is flying really upwards in air.
In distance to Northwest? I see a Giant Blue ball, It was some other country's defense, then to South is a giant warship, and this was china's defense system. To float in water.
Then suddenly giant waves start to come from north, really big tsunami, and it breaks the Blue ball and I think alot people probably died, but at that time my mind was on tsunami coming towards us. 
Then the airship started to ascend more and more until the tower was above in sky and we managed to survive drowning. Same with china's warship it managed to not turn over. 

After that we started to descent into water, and were told to go back into tower and live, and was told that the aircraft has unlimited fuel so if another tsunami came we can stay in air forever till earth calmed down once more.
So I go down the tower and it's filled with water, people start jumping down like nothing, I jump down too holding my breath, waiting till I get to room. Weirdly I managed to lose my breath twice, and tried to gasp for air but nothing happened, then someone told me that I could breathe underwater too. It was wacky as hell. It was followed by me seeing my dad in distance, he was here too. I was really glad and lucky too see my family still safe.
Then it was usual underground living drama like we forgot to pack up few things, but luckily the tower had almost all facilities etc. We weren't required to work yet, It was something like the ship in Wall-E except we were in a tower. 

Anyways sorry for disjointed writing or bad grammar, I just woke up 30 minutes ago and still freaked up.

I was with my brother, and surprisingly we were getting along well each other. 

(Just slightly long explanation why i said surprisingly, People from my hometown doesnt talk much even with family. Its not we have bad relationship. Its just we think its unnecessary to make conversation over nothing. We talk when we need to. We sometimes make jokes too tho. You know, like guy best friends. They don't be like ""heyy~~ how are you?? What did you do last weekend~~"" and hold bands while walking together etc. just say that needs to be said and hear that needs to be heard. My hometown is Daegu, South Korea btw. Near Busan. Just fyi)

And for some reason, we were walking down the corridor of a school. And I bumped into many people that day so I thought ""I wonder who I am gonna bump into next"". I was walking inside and my brother was walking the other side. And there was Justin Bieber standing in front of the door of classroom, leaning against it. I saw him and at first I was just going to keep walking, but then he saw me and started to wink at me and started to flirt. And when we pass by in front of him, he hugged me and tried to kiss me. So my brother pushed him a bit and said ""hey hey it's my sister. What are you doing?"". And Justin Bieber said "" wtf are you?"" And beat my brother. I was like ""whoa whoa wait, he is my brother. What are you doing?"" And then not long time passed, 3? 4? Police officers came said ""some kid called police"". And one of them was female and she happened to know Justin Bieber in person and was greeting with him. I was like "" hey, wait. Wtf. You know him?!"" And she said ""someone called police last time becos of Justin and I was there"". And then, I was explaining what happened "" you probably can see the CCTV over there. But he was standing there blah blah"" and I don't remember the inbetween part. At last, it looked like luggage check counter at an airport. And the policewoman was sitting there. I don't know what talk we had beforehand but she said ""oh, your brother. Not your boyfriend"" so I said ""wtf? Yes! We have same mum, same father, same grandparents and even same last name!!"" and she asked me in bloody KOREAN saying ""한국에선 그런건가요?"" Which means ""is that how it is in Korea?"" So I was like ""what do you mean 한국에선 그런건가요?? You don't have same last name with siblings in America?"" And don't know why but I said the last sentence to be funny, but nobody laughed and also it wasn't the end of the dream but my electric mat was off bcos of the time controller, So I woke up to turn it back on.",hot,Justin Bieber flirts with me in my dream,1.0

They began when I was fifteen. Most likely as a mental refuge from what happened, according to my therapist. But then, her job is to concoct believable sounding explanations for things. There’s no real rigor involved. 

I found myself naked the first time. Greeted as I awoke by the cold, solid concrete beneath me. An industrial facility of some sort, although it was never clear what it was for. Roughly U shaped, with a series of tall windows inset in the outer wall, dull yellow light pouring in through them onto the concrete. 

Whoever designed this place really loves concrete. It’s something that turns up in a lot of their work. I think it’s the blunt, homogenous banality of it. My therapist said it’s the physical version of depression. That the more I described the place to her, the more certain she was that it was all some elaborate cry for help. Worse, there was a brief spell where I believed her. 

But, a cry for help does not have relentlessly self-consistent physical laws. Nor the same dimensions every time you visit. I’ve always been helplessly methodical, and so on the third or fourth time through the same dream, I began to map my environment. For lack of any measuring implement, I used footsteps. 

There is nothing to write with in the dream, and any writing I do encounter is this garbled, ever-shifting mess of unfamiliar symbols. Signs, books, placards. Anywhere I expected to find letters. Not being able to read anything is apparently a common element of many people’s dreams. That there are common elements to everybody’s dreams somehow doesn’t trouble anyone. 

On either end of the U-shaped room, I found doors to a grand hall filled with row after row of useless machinery. Designed in a way that obviously won’t work. Gears turning against each other, Pistons pushing against other pistons, electrical wiring set up deliberately to short circuit. I thought I might learn something if I were to fix all of it, so I set out in search of tools. 

I found them lodged among stacked rows of rusty steel pipe. That’s the other thing that’s everywhere in the dream, pipes. Snaking up and down walls, overhead, underfoot. Often where it makes no sense, like a loop of pipe doubling back on itself. Nothing living, either. Never once saw so much as a weed. 

The tools, if I can call them that, proved worse than useless. Whoever designed ‘em either doesn’t know what they were meant to be used for, or thinks he’s funny. A hacksaw with black, glossy film for the blade. A screwdriver with another handle where the tip should be, that sort of thing.  

Every night, after roughly the same duration, I would wake up. Then, while everything was still fresh in my memory, I’d add to the maps. Reams and reams of them, organized into binders stacked next to my bed. Worried my mother terribly and she never missed a chance to say it. As though her steady retreat into the bottle was any better. 

I couldn’t see what else to do with it. No choice but to go there every night, may as well try to learn something. It went from a novelty at first, to disturbing, but then settled into a sort of bland familiarity. Every day, in the back of my mind, I knew exactly where I would be that night. Often making plans for some new experiment. 

Could I permanently change anything? Yes, it turned out. Objects would remain where I left them from one dream to the next. Could I break any of the windows? No, nor could I see anything through them except for the dull yellow glow. Could I hurt myself? When I tried, the pain seemed real enough that I thought better of pushing it. Could I bring anything through with me? Only whatever I was wearing when I fell asleep. 

In this way I began to amass a body of data about the place. And by then I was fully content to say that it was a real place rather than just a recurring dream. Being slammed in the face with it over and over, every single night, had that effect. With no other outlet, I posted to the internet about the whole ordeal. I thought maybe I’d find somebody who’d experienced something similar.

Instead, I found a post describing the exact place, down to every little detail. They’d gone about exploring and recording it differently, but there was no mistaking it when they mentioned the tools, or the unreadability of the text. I searched for a timestamp and discovered it’d been posted just minutes before I found it. 

So, I hastily hammered out an account of my own explorations of the place, and included my email so they could contact me. Not really pinning my heart on it, but excited to discover I was not alone. Only the next morning, after my usual nocturnal wanderings, I found the post had been deleted.

Subsequent posts were deleted more swiftly, and I received a warning not to continue “spamming” by private message. I plead my case with the mod but received no reply. It troubled me for weeks afterward. Thoughts of some stranger halfway across the world, suffering the same thing night after night. 

The same frigid, grinding, contiguous smear. The concrete. The rust. That place everybody has visited during their long, dark nights of the soul but forgets about when their fortunes improve. They move on with their lives, but it’s still there. Waiting. 

The stack of binders grew and grew. More than once Mom threw it all out. I didn’t even make a fuss, just went back to work recreating all of it. By that point it disturbed her a lot more than it did me. I’d already succumbed. Living more in the dream than I did the waking world. You need only fear what’s in the dark until you become part of it. 

A failure of imagination, I suppose. To think I’d already seen the worst things shadows can conceal. Because the dreams and resulting obsession with documenting them had begun to impact my health, my mother recommended I participate in the local university’s sleep study. She and I still meet every Sunday for dinner at a Mexican place. I order the same thing every time. 

I did it for her. I know she worries, and really, she bears enough of a burden without me adding to it. So I submitted all of my details through their website, expecting to be turned down only for a confirmation email to follow later the same day. I found a number of forms attached to it that the email instructed me to sign, either digitally or by printing them out. 

Really long, belaboured legalese. Could all of this really be necessary for a sleep study? I understood the necessity of covering their assess and indeed, it wasn’t hard to find recurring language in the documents absolving them of wrongdoing should I somehow expire from sleeping too hard, or whatever. I skipped to the end and signed, just to be done with it, then emailed the documents back to the sender. 

They chose a Sunday to have me visit. I tried to reschedule as I never miss Sunday dinner with mom, and we’d meant to discuss the matter of what to do with all of Dad’s old stuff that was still sitting in storage. When I called her about it she told me it could wait for a week, that finding some help for whatever was going on with me was a higher priority in her book. 

So, with mixed feelings about the whole affair, I showed up before the beautiful antique of a building that the email indicated was where the sleep study would take place. I checked and re-checked the address, putting it into my GPS a second time after I’d arrived to make sure I hadn’t misspelled anything. But no, it really was the place.

I must’ve driven by it four or five times trying to pin down exactly where it was on campus, too. Whoever does the landscaping decided it’d be a good idea to surround it with maple trees which render the building all but invisible from the road. With my CRV parked across the street, I pocketed the folded up paperwork I’d printed out in case they needed a real signature after all, then headed for the porch. 

*“What? Oh no none of that. My dear boy, despite all appearances, I assure you that The Institute stays abreast of every modern contrivance including digital signatures.”* The funny little old fellow welcomed me into the sitting room and took my jacket. I introduced myself, and in turn he identified himself as one “Heironimus Travigan”. I tried addressing him as doctor or professor but was rebuffed each time out of what I took for modesty.  

*“Tell me about The Institute.”* His eyes met mine, narrowed for a moment as if probing my expression for information. Then his relaxed demeanor returned. *“What don’t you know that is necessary for the purposes of your visit?”* For a start, I told him I’d like to know what this is the Institute of. He smiled, wrinkles bunching up at the corners of his eyes. *“Naturally, it’s the Institute of institution.”* When I asked of what sort, he winked and said *“Institutional”*. 

That answered none of my questions and raised more, something I’d soon learn was an irritating habit of his. Just never enough to make you sincerely cross with the man, on account of his otherwise warm, if eccentric, personality. Just as you’re about to boil over and demand some straight answers, out come the cute anecdotes, the rhymes, or some other amusing distraction.

I expected something more technical than a bed. It looked like any other bedroom except for the archaic nature of the decor. Nearly everything intricately carved, polished wood of some kind. The sheets and pillowcase both black cotton, with a black velvet blanket. In the corner, a little digicam on a tripod with a thin retractable USB cable leading to a laptop on the dresser next to it. 

I asked how they would measure my brainwaves, my vitals and so on. He mulled that over, then informed me that it wasn’t that sort of study. I could scarcely imagine what other sort of dream study exists, but he got me laughing with some hasty but serviceable wordplay, and soon enough I was tucked in.

*“I’m still not clear why I’m not hooked up to anything. I get that you can’t tell me everything, it’d fuck with the results. But how are you going to get any sort of useful data without any sort of medical technology?”* He reassured me it was all according to the requirements of the experiment, then handed me what looked like an old fashioned television remote. *“That’s the only device you’ll need. But hang onto it. You won’t get far otherwise.”*

I studied the little gizmo but found nothing remarkable. Weren’t even any batteries in it. Looked like something my Dad would’ve had in his study. Wood grain panels at top and bottom, big punchy calculator style buttons of shiny black plastic, and curiously scratched out labels under the buttons for rewind and pause. 

I asked what it was for but he would only tell me to keep hold of it as I fell asleep. *“Rest it on your chest if you like, but under the shirt. Skin needs to be touching.”* I began wondering what sort of person I’d entrusted my unconscious body to, but then thought of Mom. So, gripping the hollow little plastic box at my side, I began counting sheep.

It’s a cliche, but really works. At least it always has until now. Somewhere around thirty five, the sheep slowed down. More and more until one hung in the air just over the fence, defying gravity. This is when I realized I’d fallen asleep. Usually it’s straight to that place, no interlude. So imagine my concern when the sheep began to move backwards. 

Slowly, at first. In a stilted fashion, like watching an old timey movie while something goes increasingly wrong with the projector. Then faster and faster, sheep whipping by, jumping backwards over the fence. Faster and faster, until it was one long continuous blur. I felt myself sweating, somewhat surprised to be doing that in a dream. Then I felt the remote in my hands. 

Pause. The sheep, a blindingly rapid streak until now, suddenly halted. Again, one of the sheep hung in place over the fence. I looked down at the remote, exactly as I remembered it, and hit play. The sheep resumed their normal motion, and moments later the vision faded to black. It’d been such a novelty to experience anything else in a dream that I felt sort of let down when, upon opening my eyes again, I found myself there. 

Same cold, concrete floor. Same windows, same bizarre doors with no knobs. All the frames slightly different sizes, as though the architect had only a rough idea of how big people generally are. But, there was one difference. Something unprecedented in all of my history with this place. When I looked down, I was still holding that odd little remote. 

How could that be? I’d tried numerous times before to bring various objects with me. I think clothing worked because it’s part of my self-perception. And, apparently, because it directly touches my skin while I fall asleep. But nothing I’d ever tried would make any other object from the waking world appear in the dream, or vice versa. Until now. 

A blast of static issued forth from a small speaker embedded in the device, behind a grid of little holes in the bottom wood panel. I dropped it while reflexively covering my ears. When I uncovered them, I heard what I soon realized was the professor’s voice scolding me through the speaker. 

*“I told you never to let go of it, you twit! What’s the first thing you do but drop it! Pick it up at once, before one of them gets ahold of it, and don’t you dare set it down anywhere after this!”* I bashfully picked up the remote and inspected it for damage. 

*“That’s some of the most sophisticated technology at our disposal, right there in your hot little hands. But you must’ve realized that already when it came into the dream with you. That’s no small feat! Though it is not alive, it shares a crucial quality with your body which allows both of them to travel between the Manifold and the waking world intact.”*

It just kept coming. Seemed like a better idea to just let him talk than to inject questions here and there, as it usually turned out he was about to explain whatever I was going to ask about anyway. But only in the same sense that he ever explains anything. *“Oh dear. It’s as I suspected. You’ve really stepped in it, you know.”*

I asked what he meant. *“You’re in that place. I don’t have to tell you or anybody else which one. Everybody knows it, if not as a dream then as a certain feeling. The feeling of writhing internally even as you are outwardly placid. Of wandering alone on a dark Winter’s night. Fingernails dragged across a blackboard, forever.”*

I asked what other place I was supposed to be in. He sounded exasperated, as if I should already know all of this. *“You must’ve had normal dreams before this one. Those are your own mind. Your own little offshoot of the Manifold, as it should be. Most never get further than that, and I tell you in truth, they’re better off for it. But the place you find yourself in now is something like an antlion’s pit for wayward dreamers. You’ve been trapped there for some time, haven’t you.”*

I affirmed it. When I told him it’d been several years rather than months or weeks, he sounded stunned. I shook the remote a few times wondering if the speaker crapped out, but he’d only fallen temporarily silent. 

*“I don’t understand. It never lasts for this long. By this point they’ve always reached the bottom.”* I astonished him a second time when I explained that I’d never gotten further than the the bottom of the stairwell, as it’d been the work of all those years just to completely document everything until that point.

He laughed uproariously, leaving me to wonder what the joke was. *“My boy, that’s just fantastic. I knew I did well picking you out of the pile. See to it that you don’t explore any more of the place than you have already. If you don’t already know why, turn the remote over.”* I did as instructed. I hadn’t thought to check the back until now and discovered an index card sized mirror on it. 

*“Mirrors are another thing you’ll never find in that place. Not one that’s clean enough to see yourself in, anyway. For one thing, you’ll understand a good deal more than He intends if you do that. For another, mirrors can be used as an alternate means of escape into the Manifold. It’s not intended that anybody who finds this place should ever leave. The longer they stay, the more of the wither they accumulate.”* More nonsense. As if sensing my skepticism, he admonished me to study my own reflection, so I did. 

I gasped. It was everywhere. Why had I not recognized it until now? The texture of grime, of dust, of crumbly cracks on every surface. Which I’d assumed was actual wear and tear, but which I now recognized for something like a rash, or a fungus as I could now see it coating my neck, arms and part of my face. Overlaid on the skin like a decal, shifting about as I moved as if not completely bonded to me. 

*“It’s no good. If it consumes all of you, I mean. That’s when He comes to you, at your weakest, to broker a deal. Everything you most desperately want, or at least the convincing illusion of it, in exchange for something unspeakable. Do not pry. You have no need to know, as I’ll not let you be suckered into that. Instead, press ‘info’ and follow the sounds.”* 

I searched the face of the remote, and sure enough, one of the buttons said info, so I pressed it. A faint ping sounded from the speaker. Then another, then another. I found as I walked about that the ping grew softer or louder depending on my position, so with some careful experimentation, I set off in the direction that yielded consistently louder pings. 

Eventually I arrived at a room I’d long since scoured for any remaining detail not yet recorded in my binders. Yet, the pings were loudest here. So whatever I was meant to be searching for had to be in here someplace. I searched lockers along the wall and the inside of a toolbox with a handle lined, of course, with sharp little spikes. 

Finally, the only drawer of a great desk in one corner of the room, next to the only clock I’d ever found in this place. On the wall just under the clock, a faded blotchy stain. On the desk before me, a letter of some sort, though of course I couldn’t read it. The pinging stopped when I opened the drawer. Inside, a small pistol and what looked to be a glass sphere. 

*“No need for the pistol just yet, but have a look into that orb if you’d be so kind”* the professor’s voice instructed me through the speaker. He said it so casually that I might’ve missed it. Frowning and peering again at the strange little button box, I reached for the orb. Surprisingly warm in my hand, as if there were some energy source inside. 

When I looked into it, I recoiled. There was the professor’s face looking back at me! *“Oh don’t tell me I’m that difficult to look at, m’boy. You know in my time, I was quite the ladies’ man. Of course there’s no going back, they see to it. Now if you just keep looking at me...yes that’s it. Don’t look away.”* As I maintained eye contact with him, I witnessed my surroundings both distorting and receding in all directions until, baffled as to how I got there, I found myself someplace else entirely. 

It was the entrance hall of a mansion, beautifully intricate in the same style as the building I’d struggled to find earlier. Wherever there was any space for some sort of flourish, there it was, a lovingly hand carved bas relief depicting various scenes from mythology. The floors above us came apart and reformed as I watched, comprised of countless interlocking platforms. 

Each platform was itself intricately decorated, as expected. But each also included one wall, with a familiar looking clock on it. As well as an equally familiar stain just under the clock. When one of them descended low enough that I could get a better look, I discovered they all carried identical mahogany desks with a single drawer.

This was my first direct glimpse of them. Ghostly images of men in what looked to be finely pressed grey suits, slumped over their desks. The clock behind them spinning furiously in the wrong direction. As I watched, in perfect synchronization, they all suddenly bolted upright, materials from the wall stain abruptly being sucked into a hole in their head which disappeared a split second later. 

On the opposite side of the hole, each held a gun to its temple for a few seconds, then set it in the drawer and closed it. Finally, still moving in lockstep, all of the flickering, grainy images of men stood up from their desks and walked backwards out of frame. The clock then began to operate normally, hands turning in the direction I knew they ought to. 

In a perfect reversal of what I’d just seen, all of the men walked into frame, sat down at their desks, withdrew the pistol from the only drawer, then shot themselves. Gun to the temple, sudden splatter on the wall under every clock, then they’d collapse forwards onto their desks as blood pooled under their heads. Then it once again reversed itself. 

It was at this point that I noticed the professor next to me. Clothed head to toe in the strangest outfit, despite the fact that he’d been wearing boring, bog standard professorial attire when I’d last seen him. From the bottom, his boots were what I figured for polished black vinyl, reaching nearly up to his knees. His trousers, like his shirt, were made from rich black velvet. 

Then came the belt. A solid seven or eight inches wide, plainly serving no other purpose than aesthetics, made from thick black leather with a polished silver restraint poking through one of the notches. His gloves reached nearly up to his elbows and were made from the same shiny black vinyl as his boots. Finally his collar, every little silver button done up, looking nearly tight enough to choke.  

*“You look surprised. Did you really imagine that nobody’s ever explored these places more methodically than you? Become masters of them?”* I hadn’t imagined any of this ahead of time, and said so. It seemed to amuse him. *“Clothing is only an expression of your self image. Something you naturally struggle to change, but which is trivial for one of us.”*

Us? I scanned the room, for the first time noticing distant figures clad in uniforms identical to his on various floating platforms. The non-stop forward and backward three dimensional movie playing out on each one, if I could call it that, made them difficult to pick out unless you knew to look for ‘em. 

Almost unsurprising to see what each of them held in their shiny, gloved hands. Nicer than the one I’d been given though, made out of what from a distance looked like obsidian. One of them commandeered the platform he was on, landed it before us, then greeted the professor with *“As it ever was”*. Travigan casually replied *“As ever”*, then informed the other fellow that I was the one he’d been telling him about. 

He was clothed head to toe in the same manner as the professor save for a small obsidian pin on his collar. Some sort of rank, no doubt. Black hair slicked back with hair salve, features straight and angular as if carved from a block of granite. He held out his own remote, turned it over, then angled the mirror on the back to peer at me through it. *“Quite advanced. Never seen a case this bad, usually He’s got ‘em by now.”* 

The professor agreed. *“An unusual case. Spent years simply mapping everything he came across in excruciating detail. I know he made it down the stairwell, but not much further. Certainly never descended through the clouds, anyway. He really jumped out at me as the ideal candidate for this attempt.”* The two continued to talk about me as though I weren’t present.  

*“Excuse me, but what are those things?”* I pointed to the transparent movie-like apparitions on the countless floating platforms. I had to repeat myself several times before they’d stop simply talking over me. *“My dear boy. I assure you that you’ll be able to render the service you’ve enlisted for without ever knowing that, and that you’re much safer for it.”* But I’d just about had it with obfuscation by then, and insisted upon being filled in. 

To my surprise, he obliged. *“For the Manifold and the reality outside of it to exist, certain things have to work the same way for everybody, everywhere. A common infrastructure, underlying machinery of the universe that’s normally invisible to us. What you’d call physical laws. The one we’re concerned with here is time.*

*Time is what ensures that everything doesn’t happen at once. Cause always precedes effect, the reactions on which all of the technologies known to you depend, and so on. But it doesn’t ‘just happen’ that way. That’s work, somebody needs to do it. There is after all no shortage of intelligent life throughout the universe working tirelessly to thwart the tyranny of unidirectional time.* 

*Anybody who’s ever lost someone close to them. Who’s ever longed for a bygone era, or realized that all of the stars will one day burn out. Many of them are sufficiently motivated to try and do something about it. A former fellow of the Institute, Ronald Mallet, was among the first in your continuity. Had his own reasons for wanting to turn back the clock. They all do.*

*But if you make an exception for one, you have to make an exception for all. As the number trying to reverse time increases, and as the technology available to them grows ever more powerful near the end, more and more work must go into enforcing the forward movement of time. A certain something or other cobbled together from odds and ends, known to many different cultures by even more plentiful, diverse names.* 

*You can’t simply call them what they are, can you? It would be ugly and rude. They perform an essential service after all. So, we’ve taken something from their surroundings and clothed them with it, that their insufferable nature might remain hidden. Of course, even that name chafes them. It’s something you must never say aloud or even read, lest you never stop. It’ll consume your every waking thought, like a splinter in your mind.*  

*Don’t you feel them? They’re behind you even now, hands on your back, ensuring you go through with it all start to finish. That whatever direction you move in, it is never backwards. Not in the true sense of the word. So that once you discover what you’re moving towards, you cannot reverse course or even slow down, however desperately you might wish to.* 

*All of this was bought on debt, you see. Light, color, sound. Existence. It cannot last forever, that initial sum will eventually be depleted, at which time the debt must be paid. They make sure that nobody tries to back out of it. That we all play the only parts we’re able to, always moving irreversibly towards the end of all ends. As per the agreement. ”*

The two resumed discussing business, or what passes for it in their line of work. Try as I might I could pry nothing more from them, and was repeatedly shushed until I gave up and wandered off. Among the platforms landed on the ground floor, I found one being serviced by a pretty girl. Pretty as she could manage in that stuffy black uniform, anyway. Her hair also black, slicked back over her scalp, not one strand out of place. 

*“What are you up to?”* She looked up from the open panel in the platform, elbow deep in its greasy cogs and pistons. *“Oh, I just started today. I’m fixing the motivator, these things don’t break down often but when they do they’re a bitch to fix.”* I gestured up at the other floating platforms and the oscillating animations playing out on them, asking what any of it was. 

I noticed a brief flash of fear in her eyes. Even after that, she remained subtly nervous but did her best to conceal it. *“Haven’t you read anything in your own offshoot? It’s everywhere.”* I told her the text was always unreadable, and she seemed relieved. *“Don’t fiddle with your remote. There’s a button on there that’ll unfrazzle text so you can read it. Trust me, you don’t want that.”* 

I asked why. It only frustrated her. *“Look fella, if I knew why, I couldn’t be here talking to you about it. That’s how it spreads. I want no part of it, I’ve seen what happens.”* So for a time, I left her to her work while I studied the buttons on the remote more closely. The first one I tried was mute. 

Rather than silencing the distant voices of those two self-important old men or the clinking and clanging of the girl nearby digging around in the guts of the platform, it instead un-muted the ticking. Must’ve been on mute by default until then. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. A rhythm which matched exactly the movements of the flickering, monochrome spectres on every platform. Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

The girl didn’t seem to notice, still absorbed in her work. So I picked out the next button to try. Closed captioning seemed as good a guess as any. It only made transcriptions of whatever was being said aloud nearby appear in the bottom half of my vision. Finally I pressed language. Nothing seemed different, but then, there was no text in view. 

I opened a book sitting on the desk next to where she was working. Same desk they all have. Aha! The text inside was now Italian. Still unreadable to me but a huge step up from the swimming, garbled mess it had been before. I pressed the language button again, and it became French. Despite the language barrier it was quite obviously just the same phrase, repeating. 

I continued bashing away at that button until at last, the page was in English. I don’t know what I expected. For some great mystery to be revealed? That being able to at least read what was written, apparently everywhere, might clue me into something the professor was keeping from me. *“Backstoppers”*, I muttered. The girl’s head whipped around to face me, pupils dilated. *“What did you say!?”* 

*“Backstoppers. That’s all it says, over and over. Backstoppers backstoppers backstoppers, page after page of it.”* A bead of sweat formed at her hairline, then traced its way down around her nose, collecting on her upper lip. *“The Backstoppers”*, she whispered, face contorting in a mixture of terror and agony. *“Backstoppers. Backstoppersbackstoppers. Stoppersback.”*

The two men, arguing until now, suddenly took an interest in the commotion and came racing over. *“What have you done, boy? What have you done?”* The girl was crying now, but couldn’t stop saying it even through the tears. *“I told you to give him a simpler remote”*, Travigan’s superior barked at him. He looked wounded. *“We don’t have any simpler than that. I hardly thought he could get into any serious trouble with it.”* 

Professor Travigan sighed, deep sadness in his face. He put a hand on the girl’s shoulder as she hunched over, head in her hands, rocking back and forth as she babbled. *“I’m sorry dear. So, so sorry. It always destroys me when this happens, but you know what comes next. There’s no other choice”*. 

*“Stoppersback”* she frantically blubbered, reaching for the drawer. *“Backstoppers. Backstoppersback. Stoppersbackstoppersback. Backstoppers.”* She withdrew a pistol, stained with black sticky oil. *“Backstoppersbackerstoppersbackstoppers”* she cried as she reluctantly raised it to her temple. *“Stoppersbackstop-”*

Before I could stop her, she pulled the trigger. A startlingly loud report. Her blood and brains sprayed across the wall just under the clock, and her soon to be lifeless body slumped over on the desk. Travigan laid into me while the other fellow hung back and muttered *“She knew the risks.”*

*“Do you have ANY IDEA what you’ve done? Any inkling at all of what went into her training, you clumsy fool? The countless years she dedicated to The Institute, just to be here as a greasemonkey? Did you even find out her name?*  

*It was Julia. She had promise I can’t even quantify for you in a way that you’d understand. And what did you do, despite careful repeated warnings, but wander right into the minefield and get her killed! It’s all your fault, boy. All your fault.”*

Killed? Surely not! But he affirmed it. *“We’ve all got pacemakers. Something that works similarly anyway but for the opposite purpose, to stop the heart should it be necessary to ensure that one of us does not wake up. That what you exposed that poor girl to doesn’t leave the Manifold with us. Do you now appreciate the dangers involved?”* I sensed genuine fear from him. Even from his superior. What had I stumbled onto, exactly?

*“Can you destroy it?”* Truly curious but also seeking to defuse their anger. *“In here? Easily. It’s basic maintenance, like pruning the hedges. Otherwise it just spreads until it consumes everything. Here, watch.”* He pointed his own remote at one of the apparitions and pressed play. 

The faceless ghostly figure sat down at the desk, withdrew the gun from the drawer, and shot itself. Professor Travigan then pressed stop. That was it. No reversal, no repetition. It faded away, leaving only the platform, desk, wall, and clock behind.  

*“Of course you have to do it one by one, so it’s quite a chore. Still, a much simpler endeavor than if it were to escape the Manifold. We’d then have to track down every instance of their name in print, or spoken aloud in audio recordings or videos and destroy it all.*

*But they don’t make it that easy, either. Otherwise, especially in the era of internet searches, identifying every instance of their name would be trivially easy. You could have a list of all the works you need to destroy compiled in an hour or less.* 

*So, they tie themselves to something. Attach their name to it. Something big and influential usually, that people cherish. So you cannot set out to destroy it without your whole city, country, or species allying against you.*

*Where I’m originally from, they used a children’s hospital. It was the last name of the guy they’d dedicated it to. In another I’ve visited, it was the name of a holy city. It’s always something you can’t destroy.* 

*Countless have tried. Mail bombs, suicide bombings, arson. Always condemned by the media as unhinged losers out to harm the innocent. They really stack the deck against you any way they can. They have a great many powerful enemies, after all.”*

As he led me to the far end of the room, I dwelled on the girl who’s life I’d accidentally destroyed. However vivid, all of this must still be a dream, so I felt torn between guilt and skepticism as to whether anybody had actually died. 

I knew better than to say so in light of how they’d reacted. Whatever all of this really is, it’s under their control. I dare not provoke them under such conditions. Soon we arrived at a grand pair of wooden doors with polished brass knobs. 

*“This is who you’re looking for”*. He handed me a photograph of a pale girl with long black hair, wearing a faded, frilly green dress. *“She’s beautiful”* I gasped. *“Who is she?”* Professor Travigan tucked the photo into my pocket with the glass orb. *“Her name is Violet. At one time, a rising star in The Institute’s oneironautics division.”* 

I struggled to pronounce the term until he set me straight. *“Oneironautics. The exploration and documentation of dreams. What you’ve been doing for many years now, with startling success for an amatuer. It’s why you were chosen. We saw your posts about the foundry. That barren, cursed place in which you’ve been trapped every night until recently.* 

*We run a continuous automated search for mentions of keywords related to it, investigate those who post about it and delete all mentions of it thereafter. It was one of ours who tipped off your mother about the sleep study.”*

I complained that it still wasn’t clear what I was meant to actually do. *“Violet’s been taken hostage. Someplace even we cannot reach her. The man responsible isn’t one of ours, but he is accessible through the Manifold whenever he sleeps. Somewhere in the recesses of his unconscious mind are the coordinates and authorization codes we need to extract Violet. Her condition is stable for the time being but there’s no telling how long she’ll last.*

*Find Violet first. She’s under instruction to guide you to Dr. Bizen, your target. He is nowhere near as seasoned an oneironaut as either you or Violet, so between the two of you it should be possible to outsmart him. You already know how to locate orbs, and Violet will be in contact with you through your remote. Do try not to get her killed as well? Off you go.”*

Over my objections, he opened the double doors, pushed me through, then shut and locked them behind me. Talk about sink or swim. The room before me was as incomprehensible as the last. The backstoppers were present here as well, though restrained within brass cages at the corners of the ceiling. I shuddered, but remembered their necessity. Without the correct movement of time, my task would be impossible to complete. 

Overhead I watched as entire rooms shifted about on rails relative to one another. Something like a Rubik’s cube or sliding tile puzzle. The entire structure of the mansion dynamically mutable even as I inhabited it, making a low pitched groaning, grinding sound as it continuously rearranged itself. Through windows in the moving rooms I could see uniformed Institute officials milling about, talking with one another, doing paperwork and so on. 

The remote pinged. So softly I wasn’t sure it really had until the second time. I navigated about bookshelves, couches and tables until I arrived at the next set of double doors. The ping was noticeably stronger here but not much. I proceeded through them into the next room. Incomplete as it turned out, the far end open to the outside. I didn’t realize that was possible.

  It was like a spy movie with me trying to escape from the organisation I worked for, I don't know what they did but I just knew I just wanted out. I knew that my mother had planned to meet me somewhere.

  I was on some snowy plain with 2 figures I cannot remember. They had found me out and apologised before disappearing. Multiple jets then proceeded to target me with bombing runs. There was a voice in my mind(maybe from an earpiece?) taunting me, goading me that I couldn't escape. Every now and again he would say something along the lines of ""oh! These new *insert name of bomb model*"" will take you out!"" Strangely I could see where the bombs were supposed to be landing a few seconds before they would on some operator's radar which allowed me to frantically stumble out of the way of the impending explosions. I don't know how long this went on for but after a while I The voice said ""use the *something something, sorry cant remember*. I could see on the radar that it there were about to be a semi circle of explosions in front of me in which I responded by hurriedly diving to the ground. 

  When the smoke(or snow? I'm on an icy plain, god knows what it was, but I digress) cleared, I found myself at the edge of a steep valley. In front of me were a group of around 4 dead bodies which I immediately identified to be part of the aforementioned organisation. Assuming that they were caught in the blast I quickly started scavenging their corpses in preparation for the next wave of attacks. Finding a machine gun, health kit and most important of all, a parachute.

 I jumped off the slop and glided into a small crevasse where an unidentifiable old friend greeted me. He told me that he would go get help and that I should stay here. I wait in there for sometime before I see flashing colourful lights on one side of a cave. I go to them to find myself at a closed off fence. The other side of which is an amusement park. I continue exploring and somehow find a way into the dodgems area. I walk outside and to my horror there is the old friend with a woman standing over the dying body of my mother. I quickly run over to her. She whispers something that I cannot for the life of me remember before waking up.

It started off with me in my dream house, I was just finished a conversation with my fiance  (husband in dream) and I was telling him I'd be ready in a half hour. I got in the shower, grabbed the shampoo bottle and started singing along to the radio pelting out Foo Fighters, The Best of You and rolling around on the floor of the stone tub getting really super into my performance. Everything was great. But then a thought popped into my mind, about a little girl, and I kept thinking oh no don't think about it, it'll only bring you to her attention. The drain in the tub clogged while I was lost in thought trying to change the image of the little girl in my mind. Water started to overflow very quickly. I poked my head out of the curtain to see my bathroom door wide open, and heard my husband in the next room with conpany. I quickly jumped out of the shower, slammed the door, grabbed the plunger and got back in the shower to plunge the drain. I tried and tried and the water just kept coming and flowing out to the floor, and I realized the cup on the plunger was way smaller than the drain so it would not work. I stuck my head under the water to look into the drain to try to fix it, and then the appearance of the drain changed to something like a storm drain style but still small tub sized, I looked through it and directly into the sewers to see the girl staring and giggling at me.  The water all vanished I grabbed a robe and ran out terrified to an empty home. Then my dream did that weird birds eye view thing of another location, and I see the girl escaped the sewers and killed an armored  guard with a sharpened rock. I woke up abruptly right then, and now I'm stuck trying to process it, I'm hopeful I can fall back to sleep to finish the dream soon.",hot,"Starting my dream journal, and the Foo fighters dream.",2.0

Soon her face was just completely unrecognizable, pretty much all loose chunks of flesh and exposed muscle and bone. 

Then the dream fast forwarded to me in my room after he did this. In real life he likes to build stuff and show me new technology he has, and just like it was some new gadget, he approached me and asked me to come into the living room to see what he had made. When I came in, the skinned body of the girl he had cheated with was sprawled out on the love seat, and i could see wires going into her body from rear orifices. He had her hooked up to a speaker, and he said he wanted to test out a human body if it were an amp. So he put an opera CD into the disk thing and cranked it to full volume. The speaker inside of this poor girl let out a distorted opera note, as well as a muffled scream. I became aware that she was still alive, and writhing in pain.

0.0,3q3mss,0.0,4.0,"I'm a vivid dreamer. I always have been. I can remember my first dream super well, and that's when Shadowman first appeared. It was twelve years ago.

It started off as a really cool dream. I woke up in what was my bedroom at the time, and it was morning. Like in a lot of my dreams to this day, the room was lacking furniture other than my bed and the door that led to the hallway. I got out of bed and looked to my left, and fixed to the corner of the room is this little metal panel. So I open it, and there's a red button. I press it, and a section of the wall slides over, revealing an elevator. The inside it completely shiny metal, and there are no buttons. I get in and the elevator goes up. (Keep in mind there's no second floor to the house) 

When I step out I'm in this waiting room sort of place, with empty chairs lined up against the right side of the wall and a long rectangular dry erase board above them with a bunch of complex formulas on it. I went up to it and pushed it. The board flipped over, and now it was suddenly a window with a sky view of a really busy city. It was actually really cool. I remember seeing all the traffic moving through the asphalt veins of the city. 

On the far left side of the room there was an open doorway. It looked really dark inside. I went inside. The only light came from a computer monitor on a desk, and a red light just kind of hovering off to the right. The darkness was so thick, and I can remember how unsettling it was. I looked down and I could barely see a pair of feet and the base of an office chair in the monitor light before the guy got up. He had a super nice voice, and he asked me what I was doing up her alone. He led me back out into the waiting room, and I could get a view of what he looked like. He was wearing a red flannel shirt, tall with a strong build, but his face looked like an off-putting version of Albert Einstein. We had a conversation I can't remember, and the whole time he was scratching his neck and face, tugging at his collar, etc. Finally he made a comment about how 'they don't make masks as good as they used to,' before slipping his fingers inside of his lower eyelids and pulling the mask off of his face in the most grotesque way you could imagine. 

His clothes just kind of slipped off of his body, and now I could see what he really was. He was just a black silhouette with a blinking red light in the center of his chest. I immediately felt threatened and made a break for the elevator, somehow managing to get the door to close before he could get to me. There was a loud bang, and the door dented from him trying to ram through it. Keep in mind, this was a heavy metal door. The elevator headed downward and I fled out of the house with my family. It's a slight blur, but I remember that he chased our car on foot down the highway and flipped us over like a penny. I watched him assimilate my family, and they all just turned into silhouettes that looked just like him, and then the dream was over.

Over the years, I've called him Shadowman. He's been an interesting story to tell to people over the twelve years since then. I'm a story writer and an artist, so he became a part of my creative life, and has been for a long time. My dreams have always remained the same exciting, slightly terrifying, and full of plot rich details, and it was really great. But then he showed up again. 

This dream, twelve years later, was one of the kinds where you know what's going on at the very start of it. I was watching a movie or something in a dark room. There was just a tv light. Behind me was a figure who I assume was a significant other. We were spooning. the credits began and I started to turn on my back to face my lover, and he started to move to be on top of me. But to my instant horror, I was facing Shadowman again. He started to get sexually forward, so I tried to wriggle out and leave, but he firmly gripped my arms. I can still remember how bone-chillingly cold his fingers were. I woke up thrashing in bed, my heart racing.

Since then, my dreams have taken much darker turns, the kinds of nightmares that you wake up in a cold sweat from. I'll probably post those seperately. But it's weird. I personally believe that entertaining nightmares can invite spirits to screw with your dreams. It's like inviting them in. I almost wonder if Shadowman was a demon that I let in by writing all those stories with him in them, and then when I resisted him this last time I pissed him off. 

Since then I've been praying, and the nightmares are starting to go away, thankfully. But wow, he won't be making any more appearances in my stories.

I just had one of the most insane dreams which turned into a nightmare really really fast. I am actually shocked how much I remember of this dream.

It started off with me playing a video game (3rd person camera) and I am in a dark street. As I run across the street, there is a really small tent and as I roll over the top on the other side - I am dangling off the edge of a cliff and a booming voice says ""Everything will change with a different perspective, nothing is what it seems"" and I remember thinking ""cool, this seems like a new interesting game"" and I climb the cliff and am back on the other side of the tent. (Now I am in first person) I decide to go up the street a little bit instead of over the cliff and I see a Walmart, but as I am moving towards it, its changing - the parking lot is still dark and mostly empty, the Walmat just changed to Target, I step through the door and now I feel like I am in HEB, I begin to sweat and feel like something isnt right, I go straight to the exit and now I feel like I am in another department store that I dont recognize and I start running. In the parking lot, there is a little valley for some reason I jump in there and all of a sudden I am surrounded my mannequins all frozen in some horror position but some were talking and saying how this isn't real. I believe them. I am moving around trying to find an exit and then I see some  mannequins moving, I run towards them, I am trying to say something but I cant. They are telling me this is real and I need to get out of here. There is another person right behind me, I don't recognize him, but he is telling me something is wrong and then everything starts freaking me out. I am still surrounded my the mannequins in the valley and I wake up.

0.0,3iwwoe,1.0,2.0,"I had this dream several years ago that took place in my hometown, at my old middle school. The school had several large fields in front of it that were often used for PE, including one with a quarter mile long, circular dirt track that I would sometimes use for jogging after school hours.

At first, I was just sitting comfortably in the middle of that dirt track on the side nearest the school. There was nobody around; I was just sitting there in the dirt. And I was holding this scalpel (the same kind used by surgeons), although I had no recollection of where I got it.

You all probably have a pretty good idea where this is going. I then had the completely inexplicable urge to start cutting up my hand with the scalpel, which is exactly what I did- as if it was no different than clipping my fingernails. I proceeded to start surgically dissecting my left hand (naturally with the scalpel in my right hand, as I am right-handed). I was bizarrely methodical, first making a small, skin-deep incision on my palm, which I then used to tear all of the skin off my palm. I then started examining the exposed muscles and tendons with wonder, moving my fingers up and down on my left hand, watching the tendons attached to my fingers flex and move as I moved them back and forth. After I lost interest in that, I began trying to saw completely through the muscle and bones in my hand, just above the wrist, so that I could completely remove it. Then I woke up, and recalled with horror all the gory details of the dream I had just had. The creepiest thing about the dream when I woke up was that it did not seem at all scary or unusual while I was having it. I experienced no pain and did not at any point worry about the fact that I had just lost a limb permanently as far as I knew. I didn't even begin to consider the consequences of my actions in the dream, I was simply acting entirely on a completely irrational impulse, something very out of character for me. Yet it felt entirely routine, almost like I was simply doing it in the dream because I was bored and didn't have anything better to do.

It's important to note that I have never had a dream remotely like this before or since. This is not at all normal for me. I generally do not have violent dreams, and have never had any other dreams that involved me harming myself in any way. This was by far the craziest, most violent dream I ever had.

However, the thing that freaks me out the most about this dream now (and the reason why I decided to post this years after it happened to me) is that I recently saw some pictures from the ""Bodies"" exhibit, which included (among other things) a hand without skin on it. What I saw in the dream was completely anatomically realistic. My skinless hand in the dream looked EXACTLY like the real skinless hand in the Bodies exhibit, down to the last detail, despite that I had no idea at the time what a hand would realistically look like without skin on it. I still have no idea how to explain how I could have possibly known that at the time I had the dream.

I was locked in my house because a bird was flying at me every time I tried to leave. Some time later I was running through a field away from a tornado. I was able to survive by taking cover in a valley. After the storm passes I find my ex trapped in power lines and dozens of snakes winding around each other to get to the ground. Once one of them reaches the ground electricity runs up the serpentine ladder and the current kills all the snakes and my ex instantly.

In the dream I get into a car crash with my two year old son in the back. Right before we crash, I can see he's not buckled in his car seat and walking around in my backseat. Next thing I know I'm in the drivers seat with my head back looking up towards the roof. I look up to see people running towards me yelling my name (one of these people is my dead grandmother). Then I see firefighters using the ""jaws of life"" to get me out of the car. The entire time I'm wondering what happened to my son. This is when I open my eyes and have this strange sort of numb feeling all over my body. It was like my entire body ""fell asleep"".

We went up the first time with the instructors and it went fine, I had the feeling in the pit of my stomach like I was really falling, kind of like when you go over the crest of hill on any roller coaster. But the feeling didn't subside until we hit the ground. Then my friends wanted to go back up and jump by themselves. I wasn't too keen and decided to ride in the plane and not jump. All my friends jumped out but as my last friend reaches the door he looks back and asks if I'm sure that I don't want to go. I tell him I'm sure and he says ok but you're in for a bumpy ride and jumps out. I look out the front of the plane and see we're going directly into the storm. I ask the pilot if everything is going to be alright and he says yeah but doesn't seem too sure of himself. Next thing I know, the plane is out of control, kind of like that video where the skydiving planes collide in midair and everyone has to jump out when the plane is on fire.

I don't remember the beginning too well, but I can gather from context that there was a dangerous murderer on the loose in my neighborhood. Shit was happening NOW, like it was live on the news, he was busting through peoples' doors and slaughtering them as my family and I sat huddled around the table hoping we were safe.

The man dragged bodies into the street, fresh dead, still bleeding, cut up and disfigured beyond recognition. There came a thump from our front door, and the lock on the inside door faltered and it popped open. For some reason, our screen door held but only barely. 

But the man did not enter our house. No, instead he left one of his victims at our doorstep. I could see the silhouette of the body, it was a young Asian woman with shoulder length black hair. Her eyes had been gouged out, her jaw ripped out of its socket (but still attached to her skull), and her cheeks carved into a Chelsea grin. She was already skeletal, mangled, spidery hands frozen in front of her as rigor mortis had set in. I felt overwhelming fear, disgust, dread, and I covered my eyes. Usually that doesn't work in dreams, but fortunately for me it did this time. 

My mother, wanting to preserve evidence for the police, scrambled to bring the body into our house, which fucked me up further because... Why...? And apparently hungry bugs had already begun eating her, based on the graphic commentary from my family. 

I went up to my room, as I REALLY didn't want to be in the same room as that thing.

I don't remember how I got to where it was I saw him but I remember how I knew I had lost him. I was at a beach. At a beach with him by my side and we were playing. There was little to no shade and the water seemed to be disappearing quickly. I  kept walking, thinking he was by my side and when I turned around he was gone. Thinking we would meet up later I continued on walking or doing whatever it was I was doing. Then the fear hit. The fear I had lost him and that he was being mistreated or in harm of some sort, I need to find him, I was desperate to save him and have the comfort he provided once again. I remember an alert being broadcast that everyone should stay inside. I left. I left the hut or house I was in and I went searching, I heard gun shots, very close to me. I armed myself with a stick then that turned into a metal pipe. I heard voices of law enforcement stating the position of the people overtaking a business behind me with guns. I saw two guys with guns shooting at the law enforcement member I was walking towards. I had to get past the line of police. It wasn't much of a line, a cop here a cop there all taking cover, shooting at the wanted assailants. Shots were fired directly past me and I wondered how it was that I wasn't getting shot. I kept moving. 

I reached a forested area and what seemed to be an abandoned house or fort though clearly a homeless guy had been sleeping there. I kept wandering and still nothing. I don't know how it was that I came upon the place but I found a building and went inside, it was wood and metal. Classy but rustic, it was inviting though dark and poorly lit as if they had been preparing for whatever attack it was that was going on. I frantically asked about my dog and they reassured me that he was safe and gave me glaring looks as if I mistreated him or that I was a bad owner. I was led down a hallway and down to where the head vet or person in charge was keeping them, they said he had gotten along well with the others and when I walked into the room he was there with a few baby deer and other animals. He seemed happy and happy to see me. I ran over and had the most real, genuine, overwhelming cry I had ever had while I held him in his puppy form. All at once, with that one whelp, I told him I was sorry I hadn't been there for him in his time of need and I knew that he knew it and he was OK with it, as was I.

This night, I had woken up on my stomach. Then, almost as soon as I was awake, it began. My right hand was gripped forcefully and I could feel myself being pulled off the bed. By this time I was screaming and freaking out completely; I yelled for what ever it was to stop but the grip only tightened. It began grabbing at my wrist and it would not let go. Soon my entire arm was under the bed. I heard footsteps and soon my mum was at the door: she had heard my screams. The pulling stopped and I was hysterical. My hand felt bruised and my arm was numb.

I find dreams quite interesting and I've been scrolling through here reading about other's dreams for a while, so I figured I'd add to the collection and share my latest nightmare. It may be a bit lengthy, so I apologize in advanced for that.

It starts off at a family gathering taking place at my house. Most my relatives are in the living room and front yard. Being the anti-social introvert I am, I venture into the kitchen and end up a few feet in front of my dream uncle, who's leaning against the back door that leads out to our porch. We don't say much, just acknowledge each other's presence and awkwardly sip at our drinks. Then, it happened so quickly neither of us had time to react: my uncle lunges forward quickly as blood spurts from his chest, like he was forcefully stabbed all the way through his body from behind. He's then pulled backwards through the closed door, as though it isn't even there, and I watch through the backdoor window as he's dragged across the porch before disappearing into thin air, leaving behind only a trail of blood. I didn't scream for anyone; I couldn't and I didn't need to. The instant he was gone, this cold feeling fell upon all of us that silenced us. My family came running to the kitchen, and not a single word was said for a long time. Nothing actually spoke to us, but we could feel something challenging us to call the police or try to escape. After a loud, stressful period of arguing, we decided to all stay at my house for the night and see what happens if we don't try to flee.

Fast forward to later that night. To help visualize this a bit better, my bedroom is at the right-hand corner of the bottom floor. To the left of my bed is another backdoor with a window, from which I can see the steps and a good portion of my back porch. So, here I am, trying to sleep despite there being some demon plotting to kill my family. All seems fine for the moment, though. I look over through the window to see my dog at the top of the porch steps, staring straight ahead at something behind our fence. No; it's nothing, no one is there, I tell myself. Then he starts growling. I try to ignore him, but he starts barking like crazy. I'm terrified because I know what's there, but I act as though falling asleep will fix the issue. Suddenly, the barking is replaced by a horrible, low howl that I simply can't ignore anymore. I look over and see my dog is now on his hind legs and walking back and forth in some sort of trance. He looks oddly disfigured, and his howl sounds as though he's being strangled. 

Before I have time to book it out of there, I suddenly flash across the room from my backdoor. My hands are to my sides, and I can't move. All I can do is look forward at the window, in which I can see the outline of a dark misshapen figure. Despite the moonlight, I can't make out any features. Except, it seems darker where the eyes and mouth should be. I can tell it's breathing heavily, as though it's panting, and it's giving off this aura of evil, twisted happiness. I waited for it to move towards me, but it didn't. Rather, it moved me towards it. I started flashing-- not walking, but flashing--  across my room, pulling me forward to it in horrifying intervals that were each about a second long. I could see its arms stretched out through the door, ready to grab me when I reached it, and I couldn't do a thing. The last thing I remember in that dream was that face it had, those dark empty eye sockets and panting mouth that breathed on my face as it wrapped its arms around me. I woke up then and spent the next few hours watching the eerily human-like shadows that the trees liked to cast through my window dance along the walls, waiting up until I fell asleep again for the shadow of that figure to pop up on my wall.",hot,"New To Reddit, Thought I'd Share My Latest Nightmare",3.0

so, there was some civil unrest and protesting; and a high-profile, cop involved trial. I was at the trial, inside the 

courtroom. there was much outrage, and many court officers. for some reason, they were quelling un-rest but pepper 

spraying people.  they wouldn't take them out of the building, but they'd pepper spray them. then there was a place, 

outside the courtroom where they rinsed off. so, for some reason i objected and made protest; so i was sprayed. but i took 

the cops spray and sprayed them back.  it happened 3 times before i couldn't stand it anymore. so they helped me to the 

place to rinse off, and there two separate cops walked up and started talking to me. if you've had dealing with cops, you 

know they'll apply cop logic and attack your stance/belief/position.

that's where the dream got interesting.

cop 1: silent
cop 2: dude why are you doing this, nothing good will come of it
me: i know what you're trying to do, it won't work... it'll backfire
me: you see, you're not being a human being right now... you're just an agent of the king
cop 2: ....
cop 1: we are just like you, regular people
me: no, you are not. you're police officers, so you're doing a job for which you are paid.
me: you swore an oath and have bosses, and you act according to their direction
me: you see, we the oppressed embody the spirit of America; so you're doomed to fail and loose

we discuss for a few minutes, i can't recall all the detail

i make some profound points and they go silent and just listen.

i wish i could remember it all.

i know i explained, with four points, how they were agents of the king and were trained and conditioned.

But that is no excuse, i remember raising the point about the Nuremberg defense.

you can't just say, i was doing what my superiors ordered; that is the Nuremberg defense and it isn't valid in cases of overt and gross unjust acts.

The Nazi's tried that to rationalize and mitigate their wrong doing; but it was rejected and they were found guilty.

if, the civil unrest and backlash against cops goes on; that type of defense won't fly.

then i talked about the conditioning; who gets conditioned... soldiers, people who kill... conditioned to devalue the life of others, turned into monsters because you're rewarded for obeying and oppressing. how are cops conditioned, instructed that minorities=bad, disproportionate patrols in poor areas with orders to ticket and cite and stop and frisk; all things that infringe on constitutional and civil rights.

praised, even in scenarios where you've committed misdeeds. The cop kicked him in the face after cuffing but their superior pats them on the back and says good job.

i knew they were recording me, trying to find a strategy and gain knowledge.

i tell them that, and deny them the ability to use my likeness, name, voice, image or other aspects of my identity.

i propose, if they want to end the unrest; their leadership has to meet with the protesters in the spirit of compromise and concession. they actually agree, and dozens of protest leadership meet with several key government entities. the last strong memory is us stressing that they have to disarm because they don't need their guns here. either they trust us and want to change or they can leave and we all stay the course.

i remember them putting their guns on a table behind them and walking over to sit amongst us, because we weren't going to let them be on one side, facing us, still at odds. they'd have to sit amongst us.

then i started to wake, but i tried to hold on to the dream and see more and remember more.

but it was too late, i was far too awake and out of that twilight state where you're deep enough in that it continues to play or; or you can subtly influence it.

but i remember enough that i was able to go back over details.

i remember it was hot, and some of the cops were wearing shorts like they were bike cops.

i remember the pepper spray, and my nose running and my eyes closed but still burning.

i remember the cops in the court room, and seeing people get sprayed; often for no good reason.

i remember shouting objection to the proceedings and the cop actions, and getting sprayed, and wresting away the spray device. it was small and only good for a few good jets, and the first one i took didn't have enough remaining and only got a little on the cops face. the 2nd and 3rd i snatched early, the 3rd i gave them a good dose but other cops were spraying me too.

i remember having to lean on them to get someplace to wash off the spray, then sitting on the floor reeling from the spray.

and those two cops, having a conversation before walking over to engage me.

i can still see the one guy, hands on his hips/equipment, defiant and commanding like he was bigger than the event.

just another brain-washed agent f the king; tricked into thinking he was doing the right thing.

but they weren't.

what ever was going on, they were wrong.

but people typically plead not guilty and fight the charges, so the event grew and more unrest and protest happened as more light was shed.

oh, i remember explaining that i once wanted to be a cop or lawyer; as i explained that i wasn't just some cop hater.

i also explained that each individual case has to be evaluated, on both sides.

the king isn't always right, cops, citizens, 1%, politicians, and protesters are just human and humans can do bad things.

those that do bad things, deserve to be detained, charged, prosecuted; and if found guilty fined/imprisoned.

All the names mentioned are people I know in real life, but I've changed them to protect their identity. As soon as I woke up, I took notes on my phone to help me remember my dream.

It started at the end of gym class in high school. Heading back to the locker rooms, I saw Kelly (Note: In real life, Kelly is the girl I have been crushing on since the start of school, however, I was never able to successfully start a bond with her). In the locker room, I talked with my best friend Andrew. He's been my best friend for over five years and he showed me new memes he found as he does every day. While walking through the hall, I peeked into a classroom with the door open, and at the front of the room I saw Kelly and her friend Julia. Julia knows both Kelly and I very well, so she started teasing Kelly about me. She started urging her to 'do it' and Kelly asked me out on a date! I was lost for words, the girl that had no interest in me earlier suddenly asked me out! At that moment, the teacher closed the door. Before the door closed, I heard something about a field trip, but I don't think this has much significance. 

Suddenly I find myself at her house with a few of her friends. The house sits at the end of a private road, yellow with white shutters. On the road leading up to her house, there are identical trees on each side. One of her friends informs me that Kelly is on her way, and she plans on asking me to prom. Shortly after, Kelly arrives with a guy friend on a school bus she was driving. The guy friend starts playing the guitar and Kelly runs out of the bus and places 5 white posts in the ground, with a white rectangular sheet of wood on top of each post, spelling out the word 'PROM?'. My heart is beating and I run towards her and hug her. Her other friend is videotaping the whole thing to post on facebook and instagram later. Kelly and I hug each other passionately, then she kisses me. At this point, I completely fall in love with her. I've been waiting the whole school year for this moment, and its finally here. I burst into tears and we continue to hug while I say yes to her promposal.

In the next scene Kelly and I are hanging out at her house alone. We hang out in her room and talk about random things. I ask her if she has any siblings, and she tells me that she has two older sisters that have already graduated college and live far away. She tells me she misses them and hasn't seen them in a very long time. We continue to talk about school. We have the same English class together and talk about our teacher. We both have a mutual hatred towards our teacher. Suddenly, I realize that I was supposed to go to prom with Molly. I text my friend Henry to see if he knows anybody that could replace me as Molly's date. I feel bad, but I know Kelly is the girl I want to go with. I think about our future, maybe we get married, have kids, live at this very house. In my eyes, our future looks bright. We have our whole lives to live together, and I truly believe she is the love of my life. We laugh as we lay down on her floor, looking at the stars through her skylight. Nothing romantic happens, but we share this emotional moment in each others presence as the night takes us away. 

Kelly and I are hanging out again, and she decides to go through my phone. She frowns at a few pictures of my friends and I and I ask what's wrong. She's sad because there are no pictures of her and I, and I tell her we have plenty of time to change that. She asks me for my number and I give it to her, reminding her how I already have hers from the beginning of the school year. We laugh about that moment and she teases me about it. I realize that it's Sunday and I haven't done any homework yet, but I decide to spend my time with Kelly instead. We're both really hungry and find directions to a restaurant. We take my car and start driving on the main road in our town. I'm wearing my sunglasses on this sunny day, and we are laughing and enjoying life together. We arrive at the intersection of the restaurant, but it is nowhere to be found. At this moment, I wake up from my dream and it takes me a few minutes to realize what just happened, and that everything that just happened in the 30 minutes that I was asleep for was just a dream.

I would give anything to experience that moment again, maybe even forever. I've never felt so connected to anybody in my life like I did to Kelly.

0.0,31c1z7,0.0,1.0,"I think I have a rough idea what it meant but just 30 minutes ago, I had a death dream. You know the kind that makes you think about life. The whole scene was in the hills where I'd assume the road I used to drive 2 1/2 hours back and forth at my hometown. I was with either a bunch of friends that I think I'm familiar with but I don't exactly remember their faces. It starts when the bus went out of control and there was an endless supply of rocks and timber rolling and tumbling down the road. Imagine the limo scene in the movie 2012 but more logs and trucks. Could be the movies doing the visual set up. But, I think it was pretty lucid. I called out to a few people and tried to take control of the situation but at one point, I was pretty compliant. It was unavoidable and each passing obstacle was just a near miss. Deep down, I was really waiting for it; for that moment to pass. Something huge hit the vehicle on its side with a loud bang. The bus flew off the ridge and the next thing I know, I felt I was suspended in the air. The only thing that came in my mind was the countdown to impact. No flashback memories nonsense. I was ready to die. I felt that nothing else matters at this point. If I end up dead, so be it. I was fully prepared and braced for impact. This was the one part that made me remember the whole dream. I hit face first on some hard surface. The pain was eerily real. You know if you're hit by something so hard, it has this numbness and pulsating feeling. I instantly lost sight of what's happening. I definitely said to myself. ""Don't wake up...please. Death is death."" The rational me thought that if I somehow manage to wake up from this, I'm better off dead. When I came to, it was horrid. My limbs were deformed and I have cuts everywhere. I was barely alive and in pain. The images are so vivid it's making me sick. I did not wake up immediately in real life. How it ended I wasn't so sure. There was still a few transitions of dreams which are unrelated going on and I woke up only remembering this part the most. 

I guess it's something to do with life struggle or commitment as I've read. But, damn the little details in this dream is just too surreal. The blood and gore is just too much. Not sure what I'd gain writing here. I just want it off my chest. ",hot,Experiencing near death.,1.0

It was a really strange sensation feeling these 3 hollow teeth in my hand. They were extremely hard, much more than you'd expect from a shell of a tooth.

0.0,3038xp,0.0,1.0,"This is my first post here. I'm not too much of a writer, but I am an often Lucid dreamer, and more often than not they're terrifying nightmares. This is my best recollection of a dream that occurred during a period lasting about 4 months when every night, like clockwork, a terrifying dream would awaken me at 4 in the morning. This one stands out in particular to me, due to the intense panic and fear I experienced during the dream.   
  
I found myself in a Wal-Mart at the beginning of the dream, and at first, did not recognize that I was in fact dreaming. Some tip-offs that didn't occur to me at the time included the fact that I knew where to go to find... something. I didn't, at any point, know what I was looking for, but I knew exactly where I was heading. There also were hardly any people in the Wal-Mart, strange enough at most any hour. Even early in the morning, there is generally a handful of people walking around. I walked unhurriedly towards the guns area of the store, where camping equipment and firearms are found. This is when I was snapped into lucidity. The area where normally one would find regular sorts of cheap guns and knives was replaced with ancient weapons. I distinctly remember seeing a claymore, an Aztec/Maya weapon that looks like a wooden paddle lined with obsidian teeth (a Macahuitl?), and an assortment of other weaponry from eras and empires long past. A sensation of apprehension and near-panic set into my brain. I now knew this was in fact a dream, and I felt that it couldn't possibly go anywhere pleasant, given I had been experiencing these nightmares for a few weeks at least by this point. Then an extremely potent sensation of being watched, and a feeling like some godless demon was stalking me. I turned quickly, to find myself staring at... my cat. She's my best friend, and always has been. She found me while I was tripping madly in my backyard, and since then she's always been there for me, when shit hits the fan. Normally, she has a smooth gray coat, and very yellow eyes with the usual thin black pupils. This time, though, even though the artificial lighting was fully on, her pupils took up almost the entirety of her eyes. Within a second of meeting her line of sight, it felt like my whole body was yanked towards her eyes, and pulled through. Briefly I found myself in a formless void, present in mind, but not in my body. I had no sense of spacial dimensions, and felt very nearly infinite. Except for a malignant presence, and a much smaller one. The evil presence was crowded around and through the smaller presence. A horrifying thought pressed itself into my mind: the smaller presence was my cat. It felt like... like a small soul, to accommodate for her smaller body, and smaller will. Keep in mind this period only lasted a fraction of a second as well, similar to the time period from when I looked at my cat in the not-Wal-Mart to when I was whisked away to this realm.  
  
Then, I was on a scarred wasteland. Rocks and patches of rough grass dotted a landscape of very uneven topography. Located intermittently throughout the area were racks, holding the weapons I had seen previously, except these racks were ones that looked appropriate for a much earlier time in history; made of wood and banded with metal straps. By now I was already trying to will myself into awakening, but that has never worked for me, barring a single example. Then the feeling came again. The feeling of infinite corruption held in an innocent vessel, eyes from another dimension carefully passing over me. I turned, already knowing that I would see my cat. However, what I actually saw was definitely not my cat; at least, I don't think so. For a split second it was my cat, then it simultaneously grew ragged teeth and moldy patches of scales, while leaping off behind one of the boulders. Except... only the front half of its body went, while the back stayed behind for a second or two of the leap, the middle extending and dripping what looking like liquid shadows. I turned and broke into a run for one of the stands, after all, dream or not, I wasn't about to casually allow the creature to get hold of me. As I reached the nearest stand, a smell like sulfur and cat shit crept up my nostrils, a smell so putrid I nearly vomited on the spot. I grabbed the first weapon I saw, a sort of Japanese spear that I think is called a Naginata, and twisted on the spot just in time to use the butt of the spear to bat this creature off to one side. The front half took the whole of the hit, and went sprawling off to my left, while the rear lost traction and slammed into my knees. The sand-papery patches of scales ripped apart my jeans and tore at my skin. I fell down, but quickly righted myself in time to see the creature gather itself back up (it seems comical to describe it this way, but it was like a slinky, almost, or a spring; gathering itself up to come leaping through the air). It sprung at me again, this time spiraling away, corkscrewing like an errant paper plane. I lifted the spear in time to catch its claws, and kicked as hard as I could at its midriff. It hissed and spat, and where the saliva landed on my face I could feel burning pain, and acrid fumes made me involuntarily tear up.  
  
After throwing it again, we locked into a sort of dance. It continually sprung at new and occasionally seemingly-impossible angles, and it was all I could to deflect its attacks, never any time to try and counterstrike. This went on for some indeterminable length of time, all the while I felt myself slowing down. It didn't feel like tiring in real life, more like an eroding of will. Like every time I threw the spear across myself as defense from tooth and claw, it took a fragment of my being with it. The creature, meanwhile, seemed to never tire in the same fashion. Finally, I stumbled in my guard, and in an instant teeth were locked into my shoulder, claws piercing my sides, digging towards my ribs. At this moment, I was angry. I didn't feel afraid anymore, the small wounds I had suffered previously hurt me no longer. I wasn't afraid of dying. I was afraid of becoming a casualty to something as low and demonic as this, that had had then fucking gall to possess one of the few living things I truly care about. Even in a dream. Strength flowed back into my limbs, and I threw the beast onto a rock, and stomped my boot into its midsection, all while bringing the spear behind my back in preparation for a final strike, to end the battle. Then I wasn't stomping a creature. It was my cat. Blood trickled from its mouth, from its broken ribs, from the tiny cuts on its tiny paws where the blade had been used to swipe them away from my jugular. She tried to make a noise, but only a stream of blood squirted from her mouth. If you asked me now, in real life, I'd say that ""oh, in her eyes, I saw the demon. I knew it wasn't my cat."" But that's not true. I couldn't tell. For all I knew, the demon had fled her body for its own rotten survival. Not that it would matter either way. I swung the spear around with only a moment of hesitation, and sliced her head from her body. The last thing I saw before I woke up was her eyes.  
  
I woke up in a cold sweat, gripping my covers like they were my only anchor in the real world. My cat was standing there on my bed, having been awoken herself, presumably by my messy dreaming. She didn't say anything, but let me pet her a few times, before resuming her position on the covers next to me, sleeping quietly. I still feel unclean from what I did, dream or not.

0.0,2z3ooj,0.0,2.0,"In hindsight, it was uncanny - I was in my childhood home when inside, but I was near the quad of my college dorm near the woods when I left. It was snowing, but it wasn't dark out. I can't remember a moon, but it was almost as if I could see deep into the forest when I was out.

I remember walking about when I was attacked by a wolf. It clawed at me as I ran, tossing clothing after it and trying to get back into my home. It followed me inside, clawing at me, while my brother and I beat it unconscious with... something. It's hard to remember. As we stood over the beast, we debated what to do with it, worried what would happen if someone came home, or the beast woke up inside. I remember my father showing up, and watched him pick up the animal and take it out back onto our deck. I was worried when he came back without it, but did not speak to him. I cleaned myself out and remember going out again.

This time, I drew close to the woods, looking - I guess surveying - for any other wolves that might be hunting me. As I began to make my way home, I saw another wolf on the far side of the field, it began to chase after me as I ran home, up the back of my deck, pounding at the door to be led in. I remember being clawed at the arms and legs before my dad finally let me in out of the cold.

I felt fine, almost calm, apart from the sting of the wounds. But I remember growing indignant, accusing my father of putting the animal back into the wild. I shouted that I never would have been attacked had he not done so.

He then explained that he didn't release it back to the woods, but locked it in an open space under the deck of our house. I woke up wondering why he'd done so, or what the wolves had come after me for. I was in a cold sweat, and could almost feel the sores on my arms where claws might have been, as if one might feel scars of a wound still healing.

Last night i had one of the weirdest dreams i have ever had. I started off with me is australia. I was walking around with a camera. All of a sudden i fall off a cliff. Then i am told to go meet up with people. At first i do not know that i am dead. I see a lot of people partying and having fn. Then i talk to a clown about somthing. i do not remember what it was about. Then i end up on a bus. I am still trying to figure out what had happened why i died. Then one of the ""boners"" told me what had happened. someone had hired a hitman to kill me. So the ""boner"" asked me what do i want. All i could think about is how i did not want to be alone and he told me that someone i knew what here. as in dead. it was alicia. I do not know why it was her but i was never so happy to see someone in my life. i was crying and i hugged her. So we ended up at a school and started learning how everything work after you were dead. Honestly it was not really different in how life is today. Instead of money you have the prayers or thoughts that your loved ones or other people have said about you. Life is very happy. You do not age. However it is sometimes upset because you see whole families there because of a car wreck or other happenings. the main thing that i remember is that i was was always looking for alicia. I just wanted to be around her. The last time i spoke to alicia in my dream was when sge went for a run around the block. I told her i was going to get changed. That was the last time i saw her in the dream. So i went to get get new clothes at the mall. When i entered the mall it was giant guitar store. Kind of like a guitar center but way more extensive. It had completed guitars, unfinished guitars, amps and unfinished ones. After picking up a guitar and just walking around playing with it i remember entering an area with toys. It was small and had a couple of rows of shelves but that was it. Then i had woken up.

Anyway im walking past a boat dry storage when i see a red boat with a banner on it saying first time renter special 7.99 a month, i walk into the enterpise office with the intent of renting the boat, when the faceless lady checks her computer she asks me which one i would like, so i walk back across the street to the racks when i notice something has changed, there is no red boat, and also i notice none of these boats have motors mounted on the back. (This is where i achieve lucidity, so i start changing some stuff around to have some fun) 

So as im wondering if you have to pay extra for the motor, an old man with a beard says ""steven why didn't you tell me you were coming by, i could have gotten you a deal, on second thought just tell them you want the free trolling motor, ill throw a 150 on the back anyway"". As he is saying this my attention turns to the aft of a sail boat that is sticking out from underneath a cover. ""Now that is my lifes goal right there"" i say in amazment as i walk around to get a better view of the boat.

Another man calls my name and asks if i said that this was my lifes goal as he pulls off the cover to reveal the front of a speedboat but the rear of a sailboat. ""Is that even a sail boat? i ask, then i notice the boom and the riggings. ""It sure is, it's a speed sailboat""

The scene changes and im driving my fathers white 69 buick station wagon with the old man from earlier in the passenger seat, he hands me an ipad and says maybe you should just buy a car, check this out. The picture shows a half beetle, half camaro on a lift kit, and the price says a dollar, if you think this is a scam, try me and be surprised. I try and click on the contact me button but no phone number comes up. The old man says ""don't worry, i already offered him $500.00.

Now my old roommate chris is driving the same car, im in the passenger seat and ariana grande and Victoria justice are in the back seat. We come to a stop when an old mustang is parked diagonally on the road. I get out and pick up the car, carefully moving it out of the way, but when the back door to the laundry mat it was parked behind, opens it leaves a huge scratch on the mustang. 

As chris is arguing with the lady who owns the mustang, victoria and ariana get out of the car and walk towards a house. I call back to them, ""ariana, you are really sexy, you know"" she smiles really sweatly at me and says thank you, while victoria mocks me and gives me a dirty look. ""Sorry ariana, i meant to say you look really beautiful today"" i said and again shs gave me a sweet smile, while victoria says ""thats more like it"". 

The two girls disappear into the house, which is oddly still wrapped in black tyvac, and has no siding, while i walk back over to chris, who is still arguing with the lady who owns the now extremely dented mustang. I pop the hood and bang out the dents from the inside of the trunk, which is now a washing machine, while chris is still yelling at cieras mom. 

Ariana runs out of the hose and grabs my hand, she says ""come with me"" sweetly and i follow her into the house. We turn right immediately into a room with almost transparent pink sheats hanging from the ceiling and two other girls laying on a bed in just t shirts and underwear.

I'm basically alone in this black room. The room is so large I can't see the ends of it. Then this huge cube as big as a pyramid drops down on me, but instead of getting squished I end up carrying it with both of my arms strained so much that my muscles gets ripped apart, peeling off from my bones. The worst part about it was that I didn't feel bad about it, and instead I felt like it is my obligation to carry this burden. A couple minutes into the dream, I suddenly drop the cube. I don't know if it was on accident or I really just wanted to get rid of my ""burden"", but when I do drop it, a huge wave of disappointment, regret, sadness and depression wash over me and envelop me and then I wake up, and I can still feel all those emotions from my dream. I remember most of it when I wake up and I still do until now.

I don't really have no idea how to describe the feeling other than the feeling I have when I wake up is like my bones are hollow, my stomach is empty, and I just feel really depressed for dropping that giant cube.

0.0,2qtqu6,4.0,2.0,"This post is a bit long, but I really need your help, Redditors. To do that, I have to start from the beginning.

Almost two years ago, around this time, I would start dreaming of my boyfriend. Now, you may all think that it's sweet, but there's a dark twist to it. 

 It would start with a dream being normal. Well, as normal as a dream could possibly be. But, a while into the dream, my boyfriend would show up. Right away, however, I could tell that it wasn't really him. See, his appearance was much different, his eyes were gouged out, his nails were sharp and kind of pointed, there was dry blood under his eye sockets, his hair was matted down with grease and a bit of blood, and his smile was always unnerving to say the least.

 The first couple of times I would dream about him, it would be kind of like out of body experiences where I would look out the window and see him in the parking lot of the apartment complex, or see him in my living room, or in my closet, or even in the corner of my room. Then, he started actually showing up in my dreams. The first one was a predictive dream I had about getting into a car crash with my boyfriend and dad after coming back from the movies, and him being the driver of the car we ended colliding with. (It ended up happening in summer when we were coming back from The Conjuring). 

The next one was of my boyfriend and I cuddling on the couch, the other version of him, (What I refer to as ""Evil Aj"") he would stroke my face, and tell me that he'll see me soon. After that, the dreams got pretty tame, he would just be staring at me from afar, stalking me all the time.

But recently, I've been seeing him get closer and closer to me in my dreams, to the point where I could see exactly how the dried blood crusted. Last night, I had a reoccurring dream. It consisted of my boyfriend and I fighting in a task force, similar to Resident Evil, but without the zombies and the parasites and all that. At a certain part of the dream, my boyfriend would turn around and be replaced with Evil Aj holding a gun. In the other dreams, he would always point at my chest, and threaten to kill me. However, in the last dream I had before I woke up today, he pointed at my head and said ""Nighty night, my love."" (I know, it's a bit cliché.). I woke up before he could pull the trigger, essentially ending up with a bloody nose and a massive headache. 

Reddit, I haven't been getting much rest due to these dreams, I really need your help interpreting this and hopefully offering some suggestions as to what I can do to possibly make this interpretation of my boyfriend go away. I apologize again for the length of this post, but I had to explain everything or else it wouldn't make sense. If you have any ideas or suggestions on what I can do, please feel free to leave them below, and thank you again.

They tend to happen in more or less the same ""town"" (which is more or less just literally places I've been in my life and in particular a house I used to live in that was a weird haunted place, it's probably there because it has the most character of any house I have lived in)

Basically I'm in this field with houses all around the sides of it. For some reason I'm basically hiding in this place. I hear a voice or maybe another person (it's not clear who/what they are, or even if they're with me) and they tell me I shouldn't let him see me. I get the impression I'm in somebody else's territory and I feel very unsafe even before the voice. I look across the field to see if anything is there that I should be worried about, and I see a creepy clown. Kinda like the one on supernatural, sort of your typical parody of a clown with like, dirt muscle shirt, fat hanging out. Not a normal clown for sure.

I get afraid and I start to sneak out of the field and make my way back to the house. The house has stairs leading up to the main living space, probably 13 stairs up or so. (there's also stairs that lead down to the basement but these don't factor into this particular dream. 

I go upstairs and look out of the large bay windows looking out onto the street, and I see the clown coming up the sidewalk. It sees me in the window and starts coming towards the house. At this point I panic, and for some reason I now Ihave a glass of milk in my hands. I realise I left the door locked, so I try to sneak down and turn the lock quietly but I'm too slow and it opens the door before I lock it. 

I start to scramble up the stairs, glass of milk in my hand still and it grabs me by the ankle. The voice says over and over ""You shouldn't have let him see you. You should have stayed hidden.""

I am now being dragged down by this clown and I decide to pour the milk on it because thats my only defence. The milk hits the clown and it's face starts to melt. It slowly dissolves and eventually all there is left is steaming goo on the floor.

0.0,2btjbk,0.0,2.0,"I had a dream last week and I've been thinking on it a lot lately. It has since changed me in a very interesting way.

So the dream began with me dying a violent death. It wasn't vivid or memorable; I wasn't lucid, and so there are few details floating around my mind. I remember excrutiating pain that ripped my mind away from my body and being completely unable to give voice to the hurt I was experiencing. It felt like the fabric of my consciousness was being ripped away from my body like velcro being torn apart.

The very next thing I felt was acceptance. The pain faded so quickly that it became difficult for me to remember what happened.  And then I began to float in a dark void. I remember thinking, *I'm dead. This is what being dead is like*. 

At first, I worried about my death and what it meant for my family. How grief-stricken my wife would be. How devastated my children were going to be when they were told that Daddy's not coming home. That they would have to face a life growing up wihout me there to guide them. That I would never get to watch them grow into the young men that they will become someday. How painful it would be for my grieving mother to have to bury her son and how my stoic father would weep when they lowered me into the ground. I was terrified.

Then I began to give thought to the way that life flows. I've been to funerals. I've said goodbye to people I loved and watched as their friends and family wept. And I've seen those friends and family in the years since, having taken lessons from death. The way they can still become happy. They still desire new things in life, set goals for themselves, and *live.*

I imagined my wife doing the same. Remarrying a new man a few years down the road, setting new goals for herself and building a life with someone who treats my kids just as I did. My parents would recover as well. Eventually, the grief that they felt would become a dull ache when they remembered me as I once was. Life would go on without me, and those I loved would one day go on to be in the same type of place that my consciousness was now in. 

Let me preface the most significant portion of my dream by telling you that I am not a spiritual man. I was a southern Baptist growing up and turned into what I consider an agnostic in recent years. I don't take much on faith, and I don't think that, if there is a God, that he cares overmuch for us. So I didn't believe that I was in heaven. This dream was a representation of the terminus: the end of our life here on Earth from the perspective of a consciousness that cannot truly grasp the oblivion it was occupying.

I 'floated' for hours. I had no physical being. I had no other presence to intrude on my state of non-being. I simply was. It was *amazing*. Truly. Physically, I felt warm and comfortable, incorporeal though I was. I had memories, and was capable of new thoughts, fears, and emotions. I could see darkness all around what I thought of as *me,* but it wasn't a pitch black, invasive darkness. It was a warm darkness that resembled being in space and having the stars as a background source of light, but not being able to see any light directly, if that makes sense.

In the time that I floated, I came to terms with the fact that I was dead and what that meant. I resolved internal crises that I have had for years and decided that I wouldn't worry any more. And then a peace came over me that is difficult to describe for me. If you've ever practiced meditation before, you might have an inkling of the inner peace I'm going to try to -haltingly- describe. 

I wasn't anxious. I have always, even in my most peaceful meditations, been worried, or upset, or frightened, even in insignificant amounts. There was no anxiety in any way whatsoever, for the first time in my life.

I wasn't hurt. I didn't have a backache or a headache or a bruise or cut. I felt like I had just woken up from a long sleep and was falling back asleep, those few minutes where you're on the verge of unconsciousness and you feel *perfect.* 

I was blissful. There are really not any words I could make with this alphabet; nor words that could come through these lips to explain how blissfully *alive* I felt after I died. And then I woke up.

The first thought I had when I realized my alarm clock was going off was, *no*. I wanted to be dead more than anything in that moment, and, in all seriousness, if I was the type of person to keep a gun under the pillow my wife would have woken up to a gunshot and my brains on the wall. I wanted that peace back.

Since I had that dream, I have not been suicidal. I don't need links to psychiatrists in my area or suicide helplines. I don't want to make anyone worry. I love my kids and my wife enough that I would never intentionally harm myself, because I know that they would suffer.

But I don't fear death anymore. I don't want to die, and especially not anytime soon. I want to see my boys grow up into men and have their own dreams and goals. But, I am not scared of the 'afterlife.' It doesn't frighten me anymore that one day this life will be over and those that I love will be forever lost to me.

I know I had a dream. I don’t remember anything about it except the end, though.
At the end, I went into a room that was identical to mine. Almost everything was the same, but instead of my current dresser that had the TV placed upon it, my old dresser (mirror and all) was in its place.

Now, I’m not really sure if was lucid dreaming or not, if it was my conscious mind or unconscious mind that decided to a revelation that I was in a dream. Lately, “I’ve” realized that I was in a dream quite often. This time, I realized it because of the odd dresser placement.

After recognizing this, I did a very stupid thing that I knew I was absolutely not supposed to do. I looked in that dresser mirror.

What I saw truly wasn’t very frightening; it just looked like my face was a tiny bit distorted, kind of like a funhouse mirror effect. My eyes were a bit wonky, and my chin looked square. Apparently, my mind thought this was the scariest thing ever. This caused me to (in the dream), pass out and… I’m not quite sure if it was a false awakening or not. Truly, this whole ordeal confuses me since, in the dream, I’m not sure if I was truly lucid or not. Maybe it was a false-lucid type of thing.

Anyways, I “woke up” to me being paralyzed, seeming to be the same time of day as when I fell asleep (upon actually waking up, I figure I was out for maybe an hour or so). My room looked exactly like my current one, what I could see of it anyways. I was on my side, but lying a little bit on my back too, with my knees up, and I was staring straight down at them. A normal sleeping position for me and everything. But as I said, I couldn’t move. I could move my eyes a bit, wiggle my toes, and move my mouth. Of course, at first I tried to just jerk to get out of it, though since I have read up extensively on sleep paralysis (which may be a reason of why this was such a text book case of it, furthering my theory that this was all just a false awakening dream) I knew to just wiggle your toes.

I tried it for a long while, and it didn’t work. Feeling at my wit’s end, I yelled. I yelled for the people I knew were in the house at the time, but it felt… Odd. It didn’t sound like my voice. I guess you could say similar (same gender and everything), which is weird, since I could feel my mouth was making the movements and screaming out the words. As I was yelling, my vision faded to black, and I woke up. For real. I wasn’t in the same exact position, but it was very similar.

Now that I type this all out, I realize that during the episode, I didn’t really experience any visual hallucinations; however, I did have some auditory ones. It sounded like a piece of music that you’d play during a tense or disturbing scene, and it seemed like I’d heard it before (I do play lots of horror games, so it is possible). However, it didn’t sound like it was actually playing out loud, just in my head.

Reflecting on everything, it seems that it may have been just a dream. Like I mentioned, I have read up on sleep paralysis and lucid dreaming extensively prior to the episode, and I know very well that you can see terrifying things in mirrors during dreams and that lucid dreaming can lead to sleep paralysis. But still… It was jarring. I kind of want a second opinion, maybe from someone more experienced than I. I apologize for the rambling, as I’m not very skilled at putting my thoughts together in a non-confusing way. Thank you for reading.",hot,Scary experience... Insight appreciated.

0.0,28jrw1,0.0,1.0,"The first one, I was walking home from school(I don't go to school anymore) and I had just won a game of something. For some reason walked past every one of my family members and they all waved and said great job. This is a long outside path that passes by tennis courts that I'm walking down, the game was in the courts but wasn't tennis. Anyways, as I'm walking for some reason my family is gone and I hear people talking. I look back and here's about 6 or 7 people my age, they look sortof redneck, and they're walking my way. I look back in front and in about 200 feet there's another group of the same walking my way. My first thought was ""Ah, I know what this is."" So I come up on the people I'm walking towards and they all have these kitchen knives with black and green handles that are about 8 inches long. I turn around and theres the other group, they had closed the gap and one of them lunges at me. He slices at my stomach and my shoulder, both of which I barely dodge. Then I suddenly have two of these same knives. I slice him in the gut. He goes for my neck and misses. I stab him in the neck and, while I see no blood, there's a gurgling sound. As I turn around I break out into a run. I ditch the path and run across the field, they all chase me. The field's layout is odd. I'm running diagonally across it and usually there's a parking lot on the far right and a road on the far left. Both of these were originally here, but they were gone as a ran. Instead, the parking lot is replaced by a line of trees and the road by more field that continues around this line. I was running this way because I walk home from school, this is a longer way to get home but the other was blocked by the assailants. As I run I get about 2 feet from the tip of this treeline, and one of them catches up to me. One of my knives was gone. He stabs at me and I duck back and stab him the exact same way as previously in the neck. I ditch him and the knife and run around the line expecting to see my road home. It was not there, just replaced by a thin group of trees in the middle of the field and another treeline further back. I had an image of me running through and possibly hiding behind these trees, but didn't move. Then I woke up.

Dream number two. I'm at an old family friend's house for some celebration. I need to use the restroom so I find it. Oddly enough it's got three entrances and they're all only blocked by curtains. I give up and go to their toilet on the roof in their rooftop garden. Oddly, this toilet was on a statue in a rooftop garden(literally held by a statue) and had water intake but the hoses would spit water out onto the roof when I flushed so I didn't use it. I looked across the roof and there's the rest of the bathroom with the toilet missing. My memory skips, but there's some sort of competition. A competition to collect something. And I figure out a way to win this competition easily by gaining experience. The dream becomes like a video game although nothing really changes besides that we're in a clothing store for some reason, I put all of my experience into sneak. I didn't care where the experience went, it just made me better than the competitors so I was able to beat them to getting the valuable prize. Another contestant figures out what I'm doing, and chases me around after leveling up herself. She focuses on combat, and has a sword. She ridicules me, and does her best to try to kill me. I keep getting hit but I manage to dodge most of the blows, so I have little cuts everywhere all over my body. During this she's chasing me around as I try to hide and it doesn't work. I'd like to reiterate, its a real life video game. So it's as real as if I was walking through a store and someone started stabbing me, but I have a health bar and skills. My health is at 2 out of atleast 1000. I'm determined to level up, as though this will solve all my problems. My thought was that I could level up as much as I wanted to as long as she would leave me be for just a few minutes, then she wouldn't be able to push me around anymore. I manage to hide as she goes on with the competition(I recall being thankful I had sneak) doing much better now that I'm not there and winning every time. I become determined and run to the changing rooms. I get into one, and I know she's not following me anymore. Not too much more happens but I can't remember anyways because I start slowly waking up.

There you have it. Two dreams, both involving me being attacked and me fighting back(or wanting to). I'm interested in what you all have to say.

0.0,27ng8m,2.0,2.0,"Last night I had a dream that shook me to the bone and I'm freaked out. Normally a dream like this wouldn't bother me but this one is because I'm scared it might come true like many other dreams I've had. 

It started back when I was really little and some of my first memories were of feeling this deja vu like feeling and then realizing that it was something I had dreamed about before and now it was coming true. At first it was really small and common stuff and I started blowing it off as me just dreaming about something that happened frequently, like walking down a specific hall at school, but over the past few years it has become a bit less frequent and a lot more accurate.

 Its getting to the point where I have dreams about very odd and specific conversations I overhear and then hearing the same people having the same exact conversation down to the last word. I have had dreams about things both small and insignificant and really specific unique moments come true. 

I rarely dream and when I do it usually ends up being this premenition of sorts. Then last night I had a dream where I walked into this poorly lit room that I'm almost sure was my school cafeteria and sitting down across from this girl I really like, but she is bent forward as if she is looking down at the floor or a phone and you cant really see her body well. She picked her head up and... she was pregnant. I remember this feeling in my chest at first like I always do when I see her but then when I saw her 'baby bump' it felt like someone had ripped my beating heart out of my chest and I felt this mixture of suprise, shock and horror that shook me to my core, then this deep sadness washed over me, and I woke up, almost gasping for air. I tried to make sense of the dream and once I had I decided to see if I could go back to sleep and pick up where I left off to see if I could learn any more about this or to see if something crazy would happen that would prove that this was more of a dream and not a premonition, but I couldn't. 

 I don't know exactly why any of this happened and I'm trying to make sense of it and of all these premonition-like dreams I've had. I don't know what to do but I know I don't want any of that dream to come true. I don't know if this was some sort of sign from my sub conscience to 'go get her before someone else does or before she makes a mistake or before something you could have protected her form happens' or if I'm just crazy or what.

0.0,27ixgg,1.0,5.0,"I had a strange dream last night. 
There was this dark abandoned hotel room, old and cold. The walls were all missing bits of the wallpaper and the wooden floor started collapsing a bit as I walked in. It was a small room with a single bed and it had two nightstands at each side. Everything abandoned and a bit yellowish. There was two doors and a wardrobe. I could see that the cold was coming from the doors, as there was steam coming out of them.

After some hesitation, I went and opened the door closest to me. As I opened the door, I got caught at a cloud of cold steam and a blinding light. I couldn't distinguish what was in front of me at first. 

There was three bodies suspended by big hooks. All with terrified expressions frozen solid on their faces. The smell were overwhelming. I went to check on them and see what was happening. All I could make out of it all was that there was a working meat freezer in an old abandoned hotel room with dead people in it. I checked their bodies again to try to find any way to identify who they were, but couldn't find anything. I went back to the hotel room.

The other door were there, cold in the touch. I already knew what I was gonna find inside, but went in anyway. In this room were five bodies. One, an old man with gray hair, was sitting on the ground, a big stab wound in his chest, the blood frozen. Second, a man on his late thirties laying on his belly, he had a bloody knife on his hands and another one deep inside the back of his skull. As I was about to examine the rest of the bodies, I heard a noise back in the main room, as if someone was trying poorly to hide his presence. I went to investigate, anything is better than a cold room full of dead people.
It seemed like the noise came from the wardrobe, a little dust was coming from it, as if something had just moved in it. I opened the door and drew my gun from my waist as fast as I could. 

There was her. A little girl, sixteen or so. Her sudden scared face looking at my gun made me snap out of the surprise of finding her in such a fucked up hotel room. I put my gun away and helped her out of the wardrobe.

She told me she was desperate to get out of this room and that she was too afraid to get out of the wardrobe. I comforted her and told her to wait by the door. I made a last check on the room for anything and got out of the hotel with the girl following close.

The street was darker then the room and no living soul could be seen. Some twinkling lampposts and some usual city noises.

After some five minutes walking with the girl, I started feeling that she was getting away from me. Started a little, then one feet, four feet and at six feet I decided to stop. I asked if something was wrong, the car was close. She didn't reply.

I heard a metal click coming from her way. ""No hard feelings, but you are witness."" Her voice was cold and emotionless. I reached for my gun, but it wasn't there. As I began to turn, I heard loud sound and a horrible pain started in my chest. Everything began to fade to black and emptiness.


I woke up immediately, I could feel my heart pounding so fast and hard, I thought I was gonna pass out. It was such a vivid dream, I can swear I heard her voice again today while awake.

I was working in a warehouse wearing a lanyard that meant I was a ""higher up."" Employees that were below me were complaining about it to our superiors.


At some point there's a wreckage in the warehouse like something crashed right into it. The lights go out and the red blinking emergency lights kick on with other lights few and far in between.


I can hear screams in the distance and down at the base of the warehouse. Doors are closing and locking because they are programmed to do this. I'm up in the middle of the building on metal walkways with railing.


The place starts to fill up with a gassy - watery substance not from our own planet while these creatures swim around in it preying on people. (It looks like something straight out of Aliens though I assure you, I've not watched or thought about those movies in a long time.)


I couldn't tell what was happening but people's entire bodies started looking dismorphic. Almost like their muscle mass was depleting. The skin started to tighten against the bones and the eyes of each person i saw seemed huge, terrified, and sunken in.


A few employees and myself were trying to escape though looking at one another was horrifying. We could hear the screeching following us. We ran faster until there was no way around it; We had to swim. So we jumped into the foreign waters that kept rising around us only after we did, infant aliens seemed to swarm.


The good news was that if we moved quietly and calmly they couldn't detect us. Then out of no where, I started to bleed. Not from a bite or the strange waters, it was my period. This caught their attention like a trail to us, well me. There were about four of us left swimming so hard to a sturdy looking area of ""land."" Three of us made it while one creature was right on my tail.


We then run to what looks like an office. On the way you can see emaciated looking human bodies half eaten from the waist down. I have a trail of blood behind me and reddening my pants.


There's only me and one other girl now. I'm holding her hand to pull her along with me. She's crying hysterically. We make it to the office and as open the door I swiftly shut it behind us and lock it.


The office has boxes, a bed, an office chair with a table, and a bathroom. We manically run around it until I get to the bathroom and look in the mirror to find myself more gruesome than all of the other human deformed faces I've seen. I scream at that, the blood everywhere, I see the girl with me get eaten, and I wake up.

[fear of the future, guilt]

Inside a modern cabin cruiser, gliding over beautiful turquoise waters. Inside the cabin cruiser are rows of bunk beds with people on each one. I am rested on one of these bunk beds. Beside, above and/or below me are some familiar faces; Michael, Gary, and a few others. I cannot recall all the faces. They are all celebrating the completion of their respective courses and academic and career pursuits.

I am writhing in guilt in one of the top bunks. Everyone is in a mood of celebration and great joy, while I am forced to  feign my confidence and happiness, knowing full well that I had made no progress.

At some point I jump into the waters from the boat. I am the first of a few to do this. Someone points at some seaweed, settled at the bottom of the clear, aquamarine water. ""Look!"", someone exclaims, ""they're dangerous!""

""No they're not dangerous,"" I reply. ""That's just seaweed.""

As they were looking in the cabinets, I ran out of the bathroom, like a dumb ass, and ran into a room, it was a bedroom, I hide on the very top shelf of it, much to high for anyone to see. Yet they ran in here and saw me. I ran out of that room as fast as I could, I ran outside, right outside of the door was

My dream started with me getting into an elevator of people; a blonde woman, a black man of average height, and another person of whom the description eludes me now. The door closes and I turn around, leaning against the back wall. The elevator itself was neither large nor small; it might have been able to fit a single person bicycle longways but only a single child stroller the other way. We start to ascend but before we reach the next destination there is a jarring sensation, as if the elevator was a fish stuck on a reel, and the fisherman yanked the line to pull the fish out of the pond. 

Next there was a very loud snap; at this point the blonde woman yells in a high pitch and the black man grabs onto the rail on the side of the elevator wall, whilst the other person flees into a corner and crouches after a moment's hesitation. My instincts tell me to lay on the floor, but as I get down another snap is heard and we are in free fall; the crouched person is the only one able to stay on the floor. Myself and the other three float slightly, and I desperately attempt to pull myself down with something. Alas, there was nothing to grab. 

The falling seems to last an abnormally long time; I don't remember what floor I had been on when I got on  the elevator but surely the building wasn't as large as it felt. In fact, I was sure of it...

I m sitting in a car going with a construction worker at a site and he has his hard hat in his hand by the side of his gear box in the car. As we reach the place, he stops the car right before the gigantic structures.
There were two structures and one on the very left was an antenna tower. It wasn't that strong and was quite tall. I would say it was the same height as Empire State Building. Now the second building I am about to explain has three levels. This tower is twice the height of WTC. From the middle of the structure you can see that it was bending towards our side. Kind of like an old man. There is literally nothing around except these building and a dozen of people coming in and out of the building.
Construction worker kept looking at the very top of the building for some reasons . Not in an awe but as if he was concerned about something. He tells me,""I was supposed to be up there but I am not."" I am confused as to why he said that to me.
Ground shakes and there is a jolt of earth shaking for once. I look around and see the antenna tower falling and not towards us but the opposite side. I am scared and the construction worker shouts ""I was responsible for the work that's happening up there. People who are up there are in-experienced."" As he finishes his last word, I hear the antenna tower rumbling,  a portion of it cames right back up and bashed down the other bigger building on the right. Now the standing building is so gigantic that you have to look up and see properly as to what has shaken first. The moment antenna tower hit the actual tower, earth shook...again.

It was a rainy night. I was in a car at night arguing with my brother，with my parents in the back seat. My cousins were apparently visiting us from.out of town. My brother assumes they know our town well told them to meet us at 'the Mcdonalds in downtowb'. 'You are a fucking idiot' I said. 'There are more than one Mcdonalds in downtown' I yelled.at him. My parents were at the back told us not to argue，but they seemed to enjoy our presense even though we were yelling at each other for the whole ride. 

The next day，I woke up and tried to call my cousins. I.tried to call my older cousib firs. It connected，but only I could hear him，he couldny hear me. I called again now to my younger cousin. This time we both were able to hear each other. I made sure that they were in the right location so I could pick them up. 

After I arrived at the location，I only saw my younger cousin but not my older. Interestly，my.younger cousin brought me into a cab and took me to an unknown location. 

It was a boat，and there were people.working on the boat. A very diverse group of people. A captain like person ordered me and my.cousin to start working too. 'WTF？' I said to.my.cousin. But he didnt reply.

After work，i tried calling my.parents. I could only hear my Dad said 'Hello？' mutiple times on the phone，and no matter how loud I yelled he could not hear me.
This reminded me of a scene from the Sixth Sense. My younger cousin had a rare condition and he was very sick for a while. He almost died when he was 15. So i asked him，'Younger cousin，are we dead？' He nodded. I instantly started to burst into tears. I cried because I realized that I am not able to see my parents anymore. No one is going to take care of them when they are older. 

Shortly after I realized I was dead，I ran out to thr deck abd starte to ask everyone 
how i died. No one knew，and it didnt seem.to.matter to them. All of sudden，three men appeared out of nowhere. They looked like they were from the ancient Greece and thry claimed they worked for the god. They told me I had to be taken away because I had military training when I was alive，and because of that I didnt belong to that boat.

I was brought to another dimension. It was a garden，with a door oddly placed in the middle of the garden. I continued to ask the gods how I died. One of them said 'Does it matter now？' I was mad. But his answer made sense. He opened the door，and the door was to the living world. 'I want you to go back. Theres something we need you to do for us.'  I didnt look like I had a choice so i agreed. 'You are going to be a dead soul in the living.' 

So i went through the door. The first thing I noticed was that I was able to touch abd feel the objects. But no one seemed to knoe my existence. As I was walking  I realized someone grabbed me. It was a girl. She was pretty. She said she was an actress and she said she.might have seen me from TV shows. She was pretty but I did not recall seeing her. Like every dead person i met，i asked if she knew how i died. She didnt know. 

As we were talking，she said said that the three ancient greek men were actually witches abd could not be trusted. 'So how can i find out my death？' She didnt know. We continued to walk and realized that someone was following us. Someone sent by the three greek men to make sure we got our work done. We continued walking，I was collecting every news paper I saw on the road in attempt to find out my death. Needless to say，there was nothing.

As I was walking，I saw my brother. I tapped him in the back. And he responded！'Great！' i thought. 'Are you dead too？' he said yes. 'Wait...did u kill yourself？' And he yes again. He killed himself because he wad sad that I died. 'so mom and dad just lost their only sons？' This time he didnt say anything. And i was sure this time that no one would take care of them they pass.

I asked my brother of he knew how i died. He didnt know either.

We're quickly overwhelmed and my team of around ten submit to the enemy loudspeakers commanding our surrender. My captain tells us to be strong, we're going to become captives, but we'll make it out. Don't be afraid. I'm terrified as we walk up the gangplank into the leader's ship. 

He is humanoid, with purple skin and close cropped hair. The leader is smooth, charismatic, and obviously very much in control. He welcomes us, and says we'll take a tour of the ship before being sent to our dorms. It begins innocently enough. The control room, his soldiers' barracks. We're soon seated in a circular meeting room, and offered dinner. I notice one or two of my team is missing, but can't get my captain's attention.

They're serving us our own people. I shout this, but no one believes me, and I'm forced to eat around the slices of meat so as not to further offend our host. 

The tour continues. But the lighting darkens to an unsettling orange are we near the cafeteria, and the once solid hallway is now open-walled with grated floors. Vacant-eyed alien races are mindlessly eating greasy, sloppy, dripping hunks of meat. Chicken-like heads are being eaten by an ape race, as the same chicken race eats another species across the room. All I can hear is the slavering, chomping, crunching sounds of meat being swallowed. 

Everyone else on my team realizes what they've just eaten. Some vomit, others begin to sob. I get the gist from the alien leader over the noise that we're going to be processed for his fleet's consumption, and to remain calm. As I begin to accept my own death, I think of pigs sent to the slaughter. How intelligent they are, how they must know as I do that they're not going to come back out alive.

I have a little puppy that sleeps with me named Jeffrey.

It was a mutilated, partially skeletal deer that stood on two legs.  Its head was a bloody skull with only the eyes left.  It was circling the cabin, bleating like a goat and peeking inside from various holes in the walls.

I proceeded to grab a knife from the kitchen and stab it in the eye as it peeked through.  After a horrible cacophony of human and goat like screams, it proceeded to circle the cabin again.  ""Good,"" I thought, ""Just one more eye to go...""

The next part I remember is resting on the couch in the cabin.  I feel that some time may have passed at this point.  My friend comes into the cabin, from what I think may have been a hunting trip, carrying a freshly killed deer over his shoulder.  He makes some comment about having brought us dinner and lays the deer on the couch next to me.

Oddly enough, I really didn't think it odd that he had slumped a carcass right next to me on the couch, much less that he had left the cabin.  It suddenly all started coming back to me as the deer reanimated and began biting me.

I woke up in a cold sweat.

It started off with me and a bunch of my friends walking around a university during the evening.  Had no place in particular to go. Just walking.  Since it was evening, the colors in my dream were muted.  And as time went on in the dream, things just kept getting more muted and dull.

As we continued to walk around, I started to notice that I was with fewer and fewer people.  They just disappeared. Nobody said they were taking off.  They just were not there when I turned around.  At one point I was having a conversation with a friend, and I turned to look at her, and she wasn't there anymore.  Who knows how long I had been talking to my self.  I got really spooked out and started running. From what?  Who knows, I just got scared and started running.  

I went into one of the dorms on campus and it was actually the interior of the house I grew up in as a kid, but different.  It had a different mood to it.  Still scared I start calling out for my dad.  I am walking around the house trying to find a familiar face when I see the computer running a program.  It is just scrolling names.  Every now and again a name would highlight at random.  as the names scrolled, more and more became highlighted.  I turn around and my brother is standing over me.  Crazy demonic looking face starting down at me.  More of a zombie than anything.  I managed to get away from him and book it for the back of the house. 

I exited through the back to the porch, then into the garage. I hit the garage door opener and as it ascended I was blasted with a wall of heat.  the door continues to open and what lies in front of me is a burning world.  Much like that of the Hell scene from the South Park movie (silly as it may be it was terrifying).  

I start to walk backwards, but I couldn't take my eyes off the fire.  I backed into something that grabbed my shoulders and started pushing me forward toward the fire.  I thought I was fighting to push my way backward, but still I moved forward with ease, as if I was on a treadmill.    As I approached the end of the garage, the thing pushing me forward turned me around.  It was my father.  I started balling my eyes out.  How could this be happening.  what the fuck was going on.  

His words are what fucked me up the most.  I'll never forget them as long as I live.  

He grabbed me by the shoulders, looked me in the eyes and said ""Don't worry, it's better this way"" and he threw me in the fire.

for the past few years i've been having very vivid dreams every night (almost), and so I started writing them down to the best of my memory when I woke up.  They are all so real, and I probably have about a couple years worth of dreams (on and off) in this log.... I haven't been writing in it for the past few months due to time, but I think i'll have to start making time for it again, because there were some very interesting events going on in those dreams.  I feel like I've run the gauntlet in thinsg that I have done in them; some highlights include:

* Being shot in desert urban combat, fighting for (America? maybe?)
* crazy sexy times
* conducting an orchestra
* playing music at virtuosic levels for instruments I can barely play
* trying to out-race a speeding tornado in a car
* thrilling police chases (i'm being chased... maybe not always by police)
* being a professional Baseball Pitcher (for a team of unknown name)
* exploring new cities that exist only in my dreams with friends
* being able to fly by jumping off the ground (super hero style)
there are also deeper, more psychological ones... 

A question for you dreamers though:  for your dreams, do you have ""set locations"" for them? Do dreams tend to happen in the same locations with completetly different (or similar) events?  I have noticed that I have had dreams that take place in the same settings before; I think there are about 5-6 stock sets that my dreams usually occur in, but usually they happen in new worlds generated by my dream-imagination.

There was an apartment, a flat where a very prolific, well-known ghost was said to appear in some specific date or when some very specific conditions were met.  There had been horror movies, books, comic books and presumably video games made of her or her influence. The date of her next presumed appearance was coming up, and I was in the apartment with a group of scientists, paranormal enthusiasts and simply avid fans. The doors and windows were boarded shut so that nobody who wanted to be there to see it would flee in terror once it happened. Everyone seemed to be OK with this.

 One young man, who seemed really exited about all of this happening, told me that the ghost - I think she had a name but I here I will be calling her 'the bleeding lady' - would always appear on the very same spot,  an old floral-patterned couch in the middle of the apartment - the practically only piece of furniture in the flat -  as the body of a young woman, dead as stone with eyes wide open, torn white dress and black hair soaking wet. She would also be stained in blood, or simply bleeding. He said he'd calculated her appearance to happen on the independence day of 'GB', and thought that was a funny coincidence.  I assumed GB meant Great Britain, though I don't know about independence days.

 Either way, the day of the presumed appearance arrived, and for some reason everyone hid. I reasoned I didn't want to be in the same room with the haunted couch, and headed to the hallway, where there was a curtain that covered a whole wall. On the curtain was pinned a light pink laminated paper, in which was printed the words ""NOT HERE"". I could see there was someone crouched behind the curtain, and from its movements it looked like they were doing digging gestures with their hands.

Opposite of the curtain - I remember the house's layout so well I could draw it even now - were two doors, out of which I chose one on the right, which was left to the front door (previously boarded shut from the inside). On the door was a similar pink note, ""A FEW MONTHS YOUNGER"". I entered the room, in which was a double bed. Though the flat - if not the whole building - was obviously abandoned due to the ghost, the place was in mint condition, and I detracted this had been the master bedroom. I hid behind the bed - I somehow didn't fit underneath it - and figured I was good.

 I heard my sister's voice from somewhere, or maybe I remembered it in a flashback of some sort, saying ""..Or actually, a few months *older*.."" An unspeakable feeling of terror and dread filled me over, I gasped for air as silently as I could as my heart raced. I had suddenly realised that the bleeding lady had appeared on the twin bed.

 I woke up with my heart racing. I had never been shaken awake by a dream before, I had thought that only happens in american movies.

They are almost always really vivid and usually strange and sometimes funny and enjoyable. Lately, however, for at least the last week or longer I've been having pretty terrific nightmares every night. 

It's all the stuff that bothers me most; kids in trouble, end of the world and I'm separated from my family, wife is missing or has left me, etc... I would say last night was the worst but really every night has been terrible. I've been waking up to dwell on the 'dream', trying to solve the problem in my head the way I usually do when something bothers me, only to fall back asleep and dream something different but equally terrible. For instance the last dream I had early this morning was one where I'd stumbled upon a kidnapping ring. These men where taking kids from their families and erasing their memories so that if the family ever did track down the kid the child wouldn't even recall their mother or father. For the record my kid not knowing who I was or not remembering me, not wanting to hug me, etc.. is like a circle of hell. 

And that's mostly what the dreams have been. Sometimes it's the end of the world; we see a massive explosion in space and it's heading toward earth and we all know we have a few hours/days to live and I can't find my kids. On and on. 

I have had nightmares in the past but they are almost always associated with a fever. I'm actually pretty worried by fevers because I tend to hear voices and and they are often really cruel and evil in the things they say. This last week however I haven't had any fever and everything is pretty run of the mill outside of dreamland. I've cut off everything but water for several hours before bed and have tried to find the same sort of routine I had a month ago when I was sleeping/dreaming well.

0.0,ta0yo,1.0,2.0,"Monday morning - 7th May

After 13 years of life together, my wife and I are trying to rekindle the flame that was our childhood. We've come to my old elementary school, parking in an old burn site next door. It's 3am and only the faintest bit of moonlight is grazing the world.

   In the middle of the playground, just outside the library, there we are standing opposite each other. We both want to be better for each other, both want to make it work. We also wish that wanting was enough.

   As we stand there cupping hands - just like at our wedding as we said our vows - I see Gretel brought something along with her. I'm not sure what is it. There is also something else in the playground with us... another person.

   From the very first glance of his silhouette I know that things are wrong. He's just standing there, 50feet away, staring. It's awkward enough that we're all out at the same place at this time of morning. I feel that its grossly inappropriate for someone to be out at this time, and worse that he would just stand there, faceless in the darkness, staring at us. He's not really doing anything wrong, but something isn't right.

   I speak: ""I don't know about this Gretel."" She says nothing back. ""Is he moving? Let's go. We should get out of here."" Still, nothing.
   I can't tell if the man is getting closer or not. He seems to be swimming in my vision as I stare, but something about him is imperceptible. It's strange enough that a person would be out here at 3am, and seems to me that a normal person would do their best to be unobserved in such a situation. But no.

   As though sensing my thoughts, he starts walking towards me at full speed.
""What the fuck is that?"" I ask my wife. She's holding in her cupped hands a pair of heavy, silver scissors. Now I know who he is... or rather what he is.

   The thing is almost on me, drawn to me by its ironic nature. Knowing that it has found what it has come for, it let's off a droning, yawning cry - too full of life and intent to be a zombie. I can see it has a flat patch of skin where human eyes would sit. ""It wants the scissors,"" I tell Gretel. I know that these things are attracted to them. These very same scissors are the only thing which can kill them.

   Plan: Grab scissors. Push wife back. Kick the things chest to get some distance between us and suddenly the scissors are spinning through the air at the things face. Grabbing my wife's hand we run down into the darkness of the child obstacle course. Beyond is the burn site and my car, but...

   More of those things! It's the darkness... it's swimming with possibly hundreds them. Frozen in place, I suddenly can't move. I want to turn around and look at my wife but instead all I can do is look at individual things emerge from the humming, moving darkness. The first creature is moaning behind me, full of life.

I've also never had a problem watching the videos and then going to bed immediately after. No nightmares, nothing like that. But for a week or so, I hadn't really been sleeping at all. I'd get one or two hours a night, but other than that I would lie awake and read, or surf the internet, or just think about my life. My mom suggested melatonin to help me fall asleep and gave me a handful to take home with me. They worked great; I'd just take the pill, let it dissolve on my tongue, and an hour later I'd be fighting to keep my eyes open. After I ran out of my sample from my mom, I went out and bought my own bottle, of pills that you swallowed instead of dissolving. I have no idea if the new melatonin caused this experience, but it's the only thing I changed about my routine. Anyway, I took the new kind of pill for the first time, and sure enough in an hour I was exhausted. I put down my book and passed out. I'm not sure how much time passed, but I know I had unnerving dreams. Not frightening, and certainly not nightmares, just...unnerving. I remember feeling watched. I woke up in the middle of the night, however. I don't know if I would call it ""waking up"" because I couldn't tell for sure if I was awake or sleeping. It felt like that strange state of limbo right between the two. And I couldn't move. I'd never experienced sleep paralysis before, but I'd heard about it from people who'd tried to induce it themselves who had said that it was an amazing feeling. It was the most terrifying thing I'd ever experienced because there, standing over me, was a black figure. A faceless black figure leaning over the left side of my bed, within two feet of my face. Not moving, not breathing, just leaning and watching me. So of course, I tried to wake myself up. I tried to pull the covers over myself, like they would protect me. But I was frozen. While I was laying there in shock, I suddenly felt a light pressure on my chest. Like something dripping repeatedly. I looked up at the figure and realized it was dripping blood on me. It didn't appear to be bleeding, which confuses me looking back. Where did the blood come from? Suddenly he - it - started leaning closer to me, almost swooping downward. It had a strange, fluid way of moving, like it was made of liquid. I squeezed my eyes shut tight and opened them, and I was awake, in my empty room. Screaming. I had no idea how long I'd been screaming. I immediately turned my bedside light on and saw nothing. But as I was settling back into bed (keeping the light on) I heard a tap at my window. There are trees around my apartment, and it could have been the wind. A branch. Anything. But I was 100% positive that it wasn't a coincidence. Something was watching me. Something was in my room. Suffice it to say I didn't sleep any more that night. I laid in bed in the fetal position for hours, shaking and crying a bit. I've never felt so much dread and paranoia before, but the scary part was that it didn't feel like paranoia. I was just quietly AWARE that this figure was still watching me, the way that you're aware if someone is in the next room. I didn't taken the melatonin again after that, and in a month, nothing else has happened. I told my friend this story tonight, and he suggested that I post it here. So here I am.

Why?

Because I am having very stupid vivid dreams, recurring ones.

In my dreams I am going to the local used car lot and trying to squeeze between automobiles and objects they are parked very close to, such as a tree.

A tree? Someone would park a car neXt to a tree in a used car lot ... hold it, they don't put alot of trees in car lots.

In my dreams I am known for doing this. The last time I have to get my cell phone out to call to get myself rescued because I am stuck. Yes, stuck between a car and a tree. I wake up with a very sore stomach. In real life I don't even have a cell phone!

I think, ""This is the stupidest dream of all time""

I go running into the living room to tell my wife. She is absolutely no comfort, not that I reaLLy eXpected to find any in her.

She laughs, ""That is the dumbest thing I have ever heard."" She claims she has never had that kind of dream. 

I don't know who or what to blame. Perhaps it was the very last news article I heard on teleBision last night about Mitt Romney building a house in San Diego that has an elevator for his cars. Yes, that's a true story. Perhaps it has something to do with shopping for new shorts yesterday, trying to squeeze into the smallest size possible? Perhaps it was pushing my human powered lawn mower. Yes, I was mowing in the dark. That was the very last thing I did before I came to bed, besides playing my brain training straining new video game.

All I know for sure is that I am in pain, and the source is stupidity. The main conclusion I can come to is don't vote for Mitt Romney, my body can't take much more of this.


Update 2012.03.30: I wake up this morning with no remembrance of any dream, stupid or otherwise but more importantly, NO pain!

So I wander into the living room for coffee. I begin to work on my Japanese lessons. After I finish my coffee I get a light blanket and pillow to lay on the couch while I continue my studies. I work on several kanji characters, the last one being the character for ""friend"" 友

But then I wake up from a dream! At least this one has no pain.

Dream: I have three friends who have no names in this dream, so they will just be persons A, B, and C. I convince my alphabet friends that we need to bother someone, person D, who has been bothering us.

So here is my plan: We go to the house of D and stand on his porch. Then we wait there long enough until he feels our ""presence"". In my dream I believe that we can make our presence known to other people who are nearby out of sight through the use of psychic energy. So we get to the house of D and there is an enclosed porch, and I have friend A stand directly facing the front door. Friends B & C simply sit by the door to the porch and proceed to go to sleep. 

There is a huge gap at the bottom of the door and you can see reflections and shadows of something or someone moving inside the house. But my plan that person D sensing our presence doesn't appear to be working, so I start making scraping noises, running my shoe across the floor. After several minutes of this shoe noise person D finaLLy senses our presence and the front door bursts open.

Person D of my dream is the actor Jeffrey Jones that played the character Dean of Students Edward Rooney in the movie Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Upon seeing the four of us on his porch, he lurchs past friend A and points his finger at my face and yells, ""I should have known it was you!"" but then he turns around and drags friend A into the house by his jacket collar mumbling something in disgust. I follow them into the house thinking that I will be able to save the day with my wrestling skills. Friends B & C have had time to wake up, and they arrive inside as well. The Alphabet Gang and I just stand there staring at Mr Rooney, who has aged considerably since the Ferris B movie, and we stare at him with eXtremely huge tight forced clown face type grins, complete with teeth showing.

Strange dream... surreal nightmare

Some friends (I'm assuming. I didn't recognize them) and I, wen't into this house. in the foyer, we stopped and looked around with the candle (yes, candle; and apparently the house was haunted and we knew it). The light falls on this shadow with nothing to cast it. we almost overlook it, but look back in time to see it materialize into some evil-looking floating monkey. it splits into two floating monkeys, both just as evil as the one, and the floor opens like a mouth. we fall in. one of the monkeys prances around the pit, and the other says something I don't remember. maybe he never said it, maybe we never understood it. the monkeys merge back into the one, screeching. somehow, I'm not in the pit anymore, and it has closed up. I'm alone.

I wake up.

I'm 18 now, and an atheist. When I lost my faith a few years ago, it was more of a dive than a gentle wading... Anyway, I was lying in bed, upstairs at my father's house--he, at this point, was a minister at the regional MEGAchurch. So I was understandably resentful. I lay there in bed, cursing my former god and conjuring up some less-than-great ideas about Him.
In my agnsty babbling, I happened upon a delusion that went a little something like, ""Fuck Jesus, he's no better than Hitler!"" (Yeah, I'm not proud of it, and I apologize if it offends any reader... I was a kid.)
At that moment, I heard--no further than 18 inches from my pillow--a voice fit for any cheesy B-movie; deep, raspy, and with two pitches at once. All it said was, ""You're fucking right he is.""
It happened again.
Totally different, though. I was NOT thinking about Christianity or anything notable at all. I was just lying in bed, trying to go to sleep.

As horrible as this sounds, I’ve grown use to watching the ones I love get tortured and burn. Their screams still make me cringe, but I no longer cry and scream along with them. There isn’t ever anything I can do to help them, so I shut myself down in my nightmares; I’m always prepared to watch someone die. However, no matter how often I write about it, I never dream of the dead, but last night I dreamt of her.

There was a hallway. It was black and grey, dark and forbidden. I knew I was dreaming, but as always, I couldn’t wake myself up. So, I did what I was supposed to. I approached a door at the end of the tunnel, and, not to my surprise, there was blood oozing out from under it. I opened the door expecting to either be tortured or watch someone else be tortured. I expected to watch the end of a murder scene of my loved ones or people I’ve never seen before, but probably would soon see. I expected to have one of my senses taken away, to appear atop the highest tower, to fall, to get eaten by some monster of my imagination.

I didn’t expect to see a man hanging from a rope.

He was dead and naked. Blood was still gushing from the lacerations in his back, probably from a whip. I groaned in frustration, confusion, and fear for a moment before approaching him. I knew this dream was different. His facial features were strangely familiar. My stomach turned as realisation slowly dawned on me.

It wasn’t until he opened his big green eyes that I really realised who he represented from my real life.

Above my bed, I have hanged a Dream-Catcher in a superstitious attempt hanging from my ceiling to ward off the nightmares I have to endure every single night.

And when I woke up, for a split second, the man from my dream dangled from my ceiling, smiling down at me.

I immediately jumped out of bed to run off and vomit. A shower ensued; the dream made me feel dirty, unclean.

0.0,mcdta,1.0,3.0,"I have been lying in bed with my eyes half-open. I have the unsatisfied feeling of knowing exactly where I am, but not how I got there or why.  My mind is shifting.  Why is the bedroom light on? Have I been asleep? Then I come to realize that I’m alone. Where is Jamie? She should be in bed with me. Maybe she got up to use the bathroom. That might be why the light is on. I feel content for a moment. Then, I again start to wonder, why am I here? Why can’t I remember? It makes no sense that I’m here in bed, something feels wrong, and I can’t remember a thing.
Where is Jamie? She has been in the bathroom for a long time now. Didn’t something happen? I can’t remember. What am I doing in bed? 
I should get up. It feels like my head must weigh a thousand pounds.  I couldn’t move even if I wanted to. This is all so strange, I can’t remember anything. If only Jamie would come back to bed, then I would know everything is alright. But something isn’t right.
I wonder what I’m doing here. I know something happened that I should be aware of, but I just can’t bring it to mind. And where is Jamie? She should be back by now. Didn’t something happen to her? No, she’s just in the bathroom. I should go check on her, but I don’t think I can move. I know something’s wrong. Wait… I can remember. 
Jamie’s dead. How did that happen? I have to move now. I bring my hand up from under the sheets. I can feel it, and I remember. I feel where the cut goes straight through my throat. The blood is still wet, soaking into the sheets, cold on my fingers. It all comes back to me.

Right before my mom left, she looked at me one last time. She paused... Her eyes sunk into her head turning black, and her mouth opened to let out the loudest scream imaginable. She just stared at me and screamed for what seemed like an eternity. I was completely horrified so I hid under my covers. I could still hear her screaming.

I was in my old house that I grew up in. I was my current age (27). It started out with me and this little skinny black girl, about 11, sitting on a bedroom floor coloring. I had this feeling that I was the only one EVER to be giving this little girl attention. I felt as if this little girl needed me and I needed to save her. she was in danger. No words were exchanged but she let me know that the man she was living with was a very scary man and she needed to be saved from him. My dream then jumped to me trying to get this little girls birth certificate from the scary man. And again there were no words spoken by me or the man. Just the emotion of him keeping this certificate from me and me not being able to get it from him. The only physical contact with anybody in this dream was with this man when I finally detain him and put him in handcuffs. I never ended up with a certificate and I never ended up seeing the little girl again after I was with her on the bedroom floor. If this makes any sense, the whole dream took place in my old house in my younger brothers bedroom ( where we colored), and in the hallway of my old house in between the doors of my room and my brothers room.

Its very frustrating when I dont recal the details like how I may have detained this ""bad man"". The only thing I am sure of is that the whole time I was so emotionally attatched to this little girl and my heart ached for her. When I woke up, that feeling didnt go away. this dream accured 2 nights ago and I still think about her and feel sad. My husband thinks im nuts because he ""doesnt dream"" and I have crazy, vivid, violent emotional dreams often.  What about you guys? Ever dream of someone that you dont know but wish you did?",top,Emotional attachment to a stranger in my dream,1.0
