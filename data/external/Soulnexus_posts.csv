>""They (the Orion empire) often engage in psychic attacks that the 'Lightworker' is unaware of, but it does often drain away much of their energy, and make them lack motivation."" 

And when asked if anything can be done to prevent this

>There is. Research and employ Psychic Shielding techniques. There is much information on the internet, so I need not spend the little time we have left going into that.

This child was born with only 2% of his brain and labelled ""do not resuscitate"" , and most of it grew in after he was born.  

IMO this is deep metaphysics level stuff, he doesn't have a pineal gland the supposed seat of the soul. If you look at the before and after its still missing but other vital brain areas have grown in.  

It makes you wonder if our brains truly are our source of conciousness and if the pineal gland really is the seat of our soul.   

IIRC in the Tibetan Book of the Dead the final area of conciousness seems to be the heart, perhaps the heart chakra is the seat of our soul and not the pineal gland.

In early July, I tried to kill myself. Immediately after taking pills, I freaked out and told my mom, so I wound up living through it. I still feel like it was a mistake and I should've died. Since that day, I've felt more and more like I have no connection or reason to be in this world. I have very vivid dreams and believe our dreams are gateways to other dimensions. I also write, and a big part of me feels like my characters and stories are being relayed through me, but are actually happening in one of these other dimensions. I've always been very comfortable in my own body-- I am beautiful, and know it. I work out to maintain my physique and have a pleasant face. The past few days, I've even begun hating that aspect of me. It's like when I look in the mirror, I don't recognize myself anymore. I feel like I'm stuck between worlds, and I don't want to be here anymore. I cannot think of an explanation for these feelings and I am not suicidal. I'm very scared, though. How can I begin to feel connected again?

Perhaps it is the case that ""being present"" simply doesn't *work* until *after* the past is dealt with, losses are thoroughly grieved for, etc. And that those who endlessly praise and swear by the virtue of ""just letting it go"" and ""just being in the present"" are those who have processed their trauma and take that fact for granted / don't realize the difference, and that those who *haven't* processed their trauma would be ill-advised to put too much stock (yet) in all this ""just be in the present moment"" bullshit (which, when they have reached the right stage for it, will no longer be bullshit, but in the meantime, it effectively is).

0,asdmvr,3,35,"Most of you are familiar with visualisation, and are probably visualising your best reality, where all your dreams have come true and everything is exactly the way you want it to be. It is a great tool! There is more to it though, there is something you can do during your visualisation that will accelerate your results and change your subconscious mind faster. And it is Rehearsing.

I'll explain it using an example of a businessman who is struggling to make any sales. He can add rehearsals to his visualisation, and do that with sales calls for instance. Imagine their customer, the questions they would ask, how they wouldn't be convinced at first. And then imagine ways of coming up with answers, with solutions, imagine talking to this customer and earning their trust, making that sale.

 Try to not imagine the ideal client who doesn't really ask any questions and is just eager to buy though, imagine a real life situation instead. And don't think too much, don't think what questions they may ask, just let your imagination flow, it will do the work. After you've rehearsed it many many times it will be much easier for you to do that sale. Even if they don't ask exactly the same questions, you'll be prepared and everything will run much smoother.

And this rehearsal technique can be applied pretty much to anything. If you are anxious at meeting people - rehearse that, your conversations, your connection, how everything goes right. If you're trying to improve your singing performance - rehearse how you sing, in your mind. This works with everything.

Hope it was helpful! Thank you for reading / watching (video explanation here : https://youtu.be/pq2nL8VZcFU) and have a wonderful week 🌺",new,"If you're visualising, try this little tweak during your visualisations for smoother and better results :)",35

Sometimes when I get into a low funk I wonder… why am I so poor at managing this MerKaBa “suit” of mine? I am a master manifestor but yet I sit around in fear consciousness or old programming as if they were well-trod areas within my comfort zone. 

I have a vast array of choice points and nodes in front of me. I can inhabit any brain space or mental space or heart space that I want. So if this is a Universe of free-will, then why am I pissing said free-will down my leg? Why do I sometimes go to the effort to avoid any opportunity to feel happy, centered, and still?

I resonate with this song because I am coming to a greater understanding that a mindset of optimism, a mindset of happiness, and a mindset of contentment are all possible to obtain right here in the here and now—despite ANY and ALL circumstances—because at the end of the day, emotional states are really a declaration of intent. So set intent, embody the intent, and then wait for the hologram around you to contort itself to the energy signature you’re putting out.

So anyway, thank you Mama Cass [for yet another perfect song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1Y-TiyhAyY) for me to integrate in my Here and my Now.

&#x200B;

I'm not talking about after-images, or colors from putting pressure on your eyes, or even fractal patterns you can see when you're on hallucinogens, I'm talking about objects, faces, symbols being conjured in the black space of your eyelids. It's difficult to explain, but (mostly before I fall asleep or right when I wake up), things just appear. In full color. It's different from thinking of an image in your mind's eye... it's like something is pulling images from my unconscious and projecting them onto the backs of my eyelids for me to interpret. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, a skull appeared in great detail and it slowly morphed into a face that I didn't recognize. Most of the time it's little balls of light and color that become nonsensical objects or silhouettes in motion. I wonder if there's some sort of spiritual explanation. My first instinct was that this was purely psychological and that these images were from some Jungian wet dream, perhaps dream-spillover, but I don't know. I can often access these images in a meditative state. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone else have experience with this sort of vision?

0,arlw7g,2,4," Even though I was friends first before getting involved, I found 1 too many partners had emotional issues that made the road too rocky to stick around and plan a family   Some instances were scary but not supernatural.... just behavior based.  I took a break from dating and practiced some of the self-love techniques for 12 years. I've seen only ""They Live"" and ""Scanners"" movies, wasn't on the net or read books outside my specialty and then I ventured out to date a man who matched the silhouette I saw in 2 different dreams 15 years prior.  I knew nothing about reptilians, foretelling dreams, dark energy, dark triad, energy vampires, toxic people, the possible matrix...all that. 

I innocently ventured out to date again but found all these new things I researched online like ghosting, toxic, covert manipulation, benching, siding, narcopath, narcissist, but seeing no contact on the list and I was thinking WTH...why would you do that?   All I know now is that it seems like energy vampire types are like vultures and the experiences in 2 years its a pattern.   No wonder I stay very reclusive....now I read that you should never look to meet someone you saw in a dream which Vampire 1 came along & filled that bill.  I gained alot of foundation knowledge from Michele Belanger's book - Psychic Vampire Codex since becoming aware of energy drain attacks. 

Vampire 1   Date 6 months and recognize I'm dealing with a guy who is cluster B mess and my energy is on Empty so I broke up with him and he reacted by attacking my energy system...I felt the pain of him or his demon or something rummaging around inside my belly...he/it didn't stop until  I was able to turn around and face him.  Never break up in person...but I never dreamed that he was not the shy, quiet, and very kind guy.  He benignly met me but I soon realized my hand towel was missing....but I never asked him about it.  I think he used it to put a spell on me to make me interested in him.  I mentioned it to him at one point and he said, ""I wondered if you felt that"".  It took over 2 years for my energy system to repair itself.  I didn't realize that he was the guy from that set of dreams many years earlier until he removed his hat one day and we had already spent several occasions walking in the park.  I took it slow and got to know him for 3 months before I would accept a date for dinner.  You just never know.  He is a Dr degreed in the mind to be vague and is 25 years younger, but he is the only man that I have or ever will date that is that much younger. We were unequally yoked in age and religion but he was doing OK as a partner but I was on my best behavior without triggers instinctively using Gray Rock until I realized my relationship needs were not being met.  I initiated a conversation about it and he said he won't deal with such things... so he was released within the week and is not hoovering me probably because he is aware that I figured out his secret.....so he pretty much uses the charming shy, quiet, & kind act...but had fallen lately into devaluation relationship relating to me was destroyed by his own behavior. 

Sam Vaknin on Youtube, says he will take any ""supply"" that you want to give him, but that doesn't make you the least bit special...pretty much yours is the same as anybody else's energy and more or less you are categorized on the par of importance as one of the home appliances if you were his primary partner...as the theory goes.  (I think he was referring to energy from energy transfer method...because I'm sure he didn't mean sex because he's longterm married, is a cerebral narc, and he said he can't possibly obtain supply from compliments if he has no reason to respect your opinion.   Hmmmm.   Sam has a great covert narc video ""No Sex Please I Am Cerebral""   and Sam has said he's diagnosed Covert Cerebral Narcissist with Psychopathy).  He is developing materials to help narcissists and hearing about it is quite interesting. 

Vampire 2       2 lady neighbors go to lunch, 1 of them is about to throw away their sandwich because it wasn't good enough to eat after having one bite. The friend says....""you're throwing that away?  I'll take it""   Its been 6 months since & I thought it was odd for a multi-millionaire to take my cast off food but now I question if she needed/used my DNA for black magic.  She is deep from the area surrounding Mexico City originally.  She has complimented me on my graceful aging, figure, and positive energy and has already mentioned that she is negative energy from a bad childhood yet she seems nice and positive not envious..BUT she told me that she has ""sipped my energy and its ""good"" with a smile. Yikes. ' I don't feel much different, but this week I saw her for dinner on her birthday...real casual...and I am too lazy for days following that.  Even turned down a free trip this weekend with a different friend, too lazy to get it together in a resort town.  

 Vampire 3   A couple of weeks ago my energy got drained in a Dr's waiting room.  I felt fine and then all of a sudden I had the overwhelming desire to lay on the floor and take a nap....then a few minutes later the dr. called my name and I felt normal again.  Ive had 2 different friends on 2 different occasions scream and pull me away when they noticed a person hovering around behind me when they went out of their way to do so....Like people waiting at a public event waiting area for Uber for example.        I try to burn sage incense and do house clearing several times since.    I'm already reclusive but I keep running into the wrong types.

It may work for a few days, maybe even a few weeks, but most people are going to eventually relapse and they’re going to fall hard. When this fall happens you’re going to feel hopeless and want to leave all this “soul stuff” behind.

The path to ascension isn’t through shoving the bad thoughts to the back of your mind, its by cleaning out the metaphorical closet inside your mind and psyche. It’s by dealing with the traumas, and then replacing the space of that trauma, with love.

0,as6bz7,1,5,"Almost 3 weeks ago I posted about a strange feeling I had about moving.  It came about out of nowhere after the last year and a half where I’ve felt like I need to move but not anywhere on this planet so I was rather curious as to why.  From the replies I got I saw a few patterns which involved others getting feelings of moving or feeling restless like they wanted to move somewhere else but were unsure as to where.  After some meditation and introspection I suspect the others reporting similar feelings of either moving or restlessness might be experiencing what I am about to describe next.

I realized in the week after my post that the feeling I was getting wasn’t from “here.”  It’s taken me a while to process this and observe what is happening more.  I also asked for more information from my Guides about this and I received the below blog/youtube site which I am now in the process of reading the full entirety of.  I’ve experienced premonition most of my life with it becoming extremely obvious 18 years ago so I’m used to feeling the call to take action.  I have never experienced it where the part of “me” that experiences premonition doesn’t feel to be “here.”  To digress a bit here’s a tidbit on why I feel I experience premonition:  There is an aspect of “me” that has a higher vantage point from this linear physical identity that will sense significant “waves” of energy from significant points in my life as I’ve found the things I have premonitions about tend to generate stronger energetic disturbances.

Around the same time I was feeling this call to “move” I also heard very clearly the message to “disconnect from the grid” and this message was repeated.  I had no clue what they were referencing but I just let that intention exist and I noticed at first only a subtle feeling of being “duplicated” at higher aspects of my “self” to “elsewhere.”  This elsewhere is where that “self” experiencing the call to move is now.  I’m still experiencing this duplication/moving of higher selves right now and it hasn’t stopped.  I lurked for a while hoping someone else would post a duplicate experience but couldn’t find one so I asked for more information and was led directly to this blog through my youtube recommendations.  I’m now halfway through the blog posts and I am planning on finishing reading them as they resonate very strongly for me.

I felt compelled to share this information with those who may already be experiencing this.  I think this shift was something I noticed because I spend a significant chunk of my day in meditation navigating my higher “selves” so it was odd to me when I noticed the movement.  I feel that a large portion of those in these groups have already likely shifted parts of their consciousness without realizing it. This shifting really reminds me of Allison Coe’s video on the Tale of Two Earths.  The below blog isn’t one I’ve seen shared a lot so I think it is important for me to share it as he not only describes himself shifting and feeling in “two places at once” just like I do right now but he goes into great detail about various concepts including negative polarities, the difference between the ascension and the energy pulse event, and even discusses being a spiritual warrior which I deeply resonated with.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dl4_3_1PyA) is from Todd Deviney who had several interesting QHHT sessions.  He discusses the concepts of Ascension vs. the Light Pulse Event.  I am definitely experiencing this dipole split experience he describes and what was really interesting to me was how before I even watched this video I used my higher self to view what I was already calling the “old earth” and “new earth” and noticed there were others who had partly moved over.  The old earth already appeared to me to be turning darker while the new earth was becoming brighter everyday.  I checked this observation using the same higher self view technique and noticed it.  Then I listened to his video describing this process which really resonates with what I’m observing.

This blog post [Standing in the Nexxus](http://enlightenedaspectproductions.org/blog/standing-in-the-nexxus/) is where Todd describes waking up and feeling in two places at once.  I can connect with these parts of my consciousness that were previously focused here on this “earth” and feel what they are picking up in this new place they are at.  It was extremely odd to realize this at first but well, I’m getting used to it.  I have no clue how long this is going to go on for but this is my new normal.  

I hope this information is useful for anyone else out there that is experiencing a shift to an entirely new place or feeling like they are in two places at once.  I do recommend Todd’s blog regardless because his information was extremely helpful for me.  I connect very much to the perspective coming through his blog posts as it reflects things I’ve observed and realized in regards to my purpose here at this time.  I have a similar perspective on the negative polarities as well as I had a purpose to deal with them directly as well.  He also has pretty cut to the point perspectives on what each person individually can choose and do at this time in regards to this ascension dipole process.  Also he has some great info on what the energetic waves are accomplishing at this time as well.

I started feeling really happy and more positive about myself, but ever since I started feeling this way...I keep seeing 22:22 or 11:11, 12:12 and so on pretty much everyday.

Could you please help me find out the deeper meaning of this?

Thank you and all the love",new,I keep seeing the same numbers.,14
0,as12dt,18,8,"I have been reading a lot about many things recently regarding the connections between soul/spirit and brain, specifically, with brain injuries and diseases. I have read spiritual, scientific, explanations, etc.  I'm not trying to side with anything, just genuinely curious with what people think.

So let's say there is indeed a soul, and that soul is us, our consciousness, our spiritual body. The brain is only a medium or a conduit between the spiritual and the physical realm, and that after the body dies, the spirit goes on:

1. what do you think the interactions between them will be if the brain is somehow handicapped or if that connection is distorted? think of brain injuries, genetic diseases, late on-set degenerative disorders.
2. If the soul is indeed our spiritual body, where does the soul end and the mind begin in terms of Personality? since experience and memories play a huge part in shaping our personality (A person growing with lots of good dogs will be a dog lover personality type)
3. One version of the afterlife consists of you meeting your loved ones again, If consciousness passes on to the afterlife and consciousness is affected by these ailments, how would it work for these people?

**I have come up with some through-provoking scenarios and questions that might help.**

Grandma lived up to 70, she was very healthy until she died in a sudden car crash. Her soul and consciousness passes on to the afterlife, you die 30 years later and see her again with the afterlife, reunites and talk with her along with other dead family members.

* What if same grandma instead survived the car crash without a scratch, but was diagnosed with dementia at age 71, and started to 'lose' herself at 72.  Unable to speak or recognize anyone, but lived on for 9 long years. She dies and her soul and consciousness passed on to the afterlife.
   * was her 'true self' hidden by Dementia for 9 long years? Was the soul unable to properly express itself during that time? or is the other way around and the injury caused her soul to change? In the afterlife what would she be like then?
      * Either you see your grandma in the afterlife with dementia as-is after she died
      * or that the soul had a 'save point' from when before dementia took over the body
      * or that the soul saves the best and good parts of your mind/experiences and comes up with an 'ultimate' version of it. *A good comparison here is when Darth Vader died in Star Wars and his 'force ghost' appeared.*
* Let's go farther in time, What if instead, that grandma lived normally but at age 20 where she sustained a brain injury, and is now intellectually disabled, she was dependent for 40 years up to her death.
   * The connection between spirit and body was distorted at 20 yrs old, therefore for the last 40 years, was her 'true self' hidden by the brain injury and you have never actually met your 'true' grandma? Was the soul unable to properly express itself? or is the other way around and the injury caused her soul to change ?(If that's the case then think about dementia and the afterlife again), In the afterlife what would she be like?
      * Either you see your grandma in the afterlife intellectually disabled as-is after she died
      * or that the soul had a 'save point' from when the disability took over the body(losing 40 years of life experience?)
      * or that the soul saves the best and good parts of your mind/experiences and comes up with an 'ultimate' version of it. (having all the experiences but no more intellectual disability). Although you could argue though that the afterlife might not have the concepts of intellect and personalities, but what do you think it would be?
* Let's go even farther, What if grandma was born normal, but she was a criminal for 60 years until death, showing extreme signs of psychopathic behavior.
   * was the connection even distorted? If so then you have never met the 'real' grandma?
   * What is the difference in terms of the composition of the soul between her being naturally born with psychopathic tendencies as opposed to someone being naturally good at first but suffering an injury later turning into a psychopath?",new,Soul/Spirit vs Mind-Body with Dementia/Brain Injury/Personality changes,8

0,arpkp6,62,17,"Hello,  


I help people identify their soul frequency and kind of act as a guide to get things going on the right ""tracks"" into this vast, bizarre world of spirituality and groundedness.  


I usually help people 1:1 but I think it might be better to just tackle large problems at once as I'm seeing a lot of repeating issues going on.  


I would love to hear, if you would be willing to share, what you're currently struggling with, or large themes you do not understand. Things I usually come across are (these are examples perhaps to spark an idea):  
\-Not knowing who/what you are

\-Not understanding direction in life

\-Getting trapped up in the ""monkey mind"" story

\-Not knowing what the next steps are

\-unable to access intuition or innate skills yet  


If you have any of those and wish to expand on them I'd love to hear. I make mediations as my day job but I'm now more interested in making videos/meditatoins for people as I think it could help more than doing it for other companies. So really, any info you're willing to share can help me help people like you.  


If not, have a good day either way :)

Only a few others times felt the bliss felt from that Thursday night.  My job is gone and the bruises on my face healed... Shaved the side of my head and faded up the back ended up with  kick ass hair cut.

The Thursday night.  The bliss.  Words will not suffice.  Felt it before laughing like a mad man saying it ""Puts The Binkie in the mouth!"" laughing to the point of hiding the tears of confusion right behind the surface feeling infinite inside the finite.  That started me LOOKING FOR THE PATH called the spiritual journey.  

The second time felt this energy we've come to know as Hermes Mercury Thoth (Last Spring) and that lead me with the help of some spiritual sponsors showing up along way to... This.  Living out a real-life of being an alchemists.

On the Discord server Thursday night two?  One?  Three?  Thursdays ago?  Have never felt two souls becoming one in this principle of gender meets transmutation meets both parties laughing in state of Bliss for 9 hours.  The day before remember her showing me The Kyballion she picked up from the Library... FaceTime HD ascension insanity another synchronicity... Another Kyballion institution visit involving me and I and we.

""Nobody came for me when I cracked this time.""  The cigarette burns aimlessly.

 In the motivational poster covered day room of the Peak and Valley Crisis Stabilization Unit the lull after lunch we can feel her drawing the flower of life and snapping photos sneaking the photos into the ALL the the server like a junkie sneaking pills during a rehab in-house meeting except she's sending the art to the world in the ethereal cords heavy is the head that wears the crown.

They got me feeling like an airplane in the sky.  Feeling like a bird sitting high.

The adolescent dreams become reality as the divorce papers sit like an open sore that is usually my forehead while scrubbing the walls removing the smell and vibrations of the ex-wife.

 Crazy.  Crazy.  Crazy.  Crazy.  I step on a Christmas ornament that fell from  a box labeled kitchen and the blood follows me around the house on the tile in a Hansen and Gretel zombie edition.

""So you're just... Going?""

The voice comes from the cellphone yet it's used as a internet tool only.  Voice Over IP.  Haven't owned a phone in awhile.  Cal 911.  Hang up.  You tell me how they ""triangulate"" you so... Woosah.  Focus.

The voice is one of my spiritual mentors.  ""Hey.  Did you hear me?""  I squeeze the rag into the bucket and start elbow greasing the hallway.  

""Yeah,"" I finally say, ""it's not like that.  Not going there.  Or to any one place or thing.  Just... Going.""

""Yeah but to Boston, right?  Or her?""

The contrast between the clean wall and dirty is overwhelming my thought process.  ""There is no her.  There is no place.  I am not going to Boston.  Yet it might lead me to Boston.""  The bucket of water is filthy and dirty.

""What about money or where you'll sleep?""

I throw the water out the window and refill it with clear, clean, new water.

""It will be taken care of as it is now.  My view is great yet it's still jail.""

Silence.  One side of the wall shines.

I draw a Vesica Pisces into the dirty side of hallway and feel everyone in the world currently thinking of the flower of flame.

""Let me call you back.  Just let everyone know I'm fine.""

I always start my open eyed session by coming out of a closed eye session, and typically I have to breathe and get myself back into a meditative state.

Today as soon as I opened my eyes everything felt surreal (almost psychedelic), and light was flashing in a way that seemed like some sort of code. 

I let my focus begin to slip after trying to decode the patterns to no avail, and my HS said “if only you chose to understand what you’re being shown”  this was followed by chills and a moment that felt like my brain got flushed down a toilet. 

I started feeling like I was detaching from the world and got scared and thwarted the experience. It almost felt like I was about to “breakthrough” on a Dmt trip, but refused to allow myself.

Has anyone had a similar experience? While I’ve had plenty of weird stuff happen during meditation this has piqued my curiosity, and I’m really interested as to “how” I could decode those messages as my higher self claimed.

But before, I also was under the assumption that most people and the government were generally all striving for things to be great for ALL people.

Now, I'm learning more about how corrupt our power systems are; control systems; the atrocities that go on and are covered up; how the world we live in is designed to benefit a very few select people... And it has made me so much more anxious. Even the thoughtless, hurtful interactions that I witness between other people give me anxiety, because I see how destructive their behavior is, but so many of them will likely never care.

So, how do you cope? It's starting to get to a point where my general well-being isn't really so well anymore... I can't relax at all anymore, ever, when I know how NOT okay things are, and how little I can do about it. The idea just depresses me so much.

We've been nurtured into accepting that this way is the only and right way when this isn't true. The school system on this planet sucks and that's just the start of this planet. Teaching useless shit to us just to get a piece of paper with a letter which allows you to get into certain colleges and universities where we spend years just to get another piece of paper that tells us what jobs we can apply for.

I'm not saying education is bad, far from it, I love learning new things. The education system however needs a drastic change. We spend so much of our time in education even though most of us will work for double the amount of time we were in education. How insane is that? A single piece of paper can determine our whole life. It's like we live in a dictatorship run by pieces of paper which sounds like a plot for a crappy sci-fi film but it's real on this planet.

Then because of all the money, many people go and spend it on things like cars and try and get the flashiest one when public transport is a thing and you have legs so you can walk to places. Fun fact, back before we had cars, we had street cars which was the public transport of the day and it worked well until car companies came. (See, education can be fun)

There's also people that live in the third world. No good planet would have people suffering everyday barely getting by.

I'm lucky that I have a roof over my head and money to spend and can spend time doing things and not worrying about it, where many people don't have that luxury.

In a perfect world, everyone would have a decent place to live, no one would have to worry about getting supplies which means money may not exist in the perfect world. It is a bit of a weird concept to begin with. Education would be something you choose to do, instead of it being mandatory. Every job that I want in my field says I need a degree, I'm at university not because I want to be but because I have no choice to be there. And there would be no grades that determine your whole life. I want to be in a creative field and I find it weird that creativity is marked, creativity should be experienced, not marked. This isn't a good planet, sure I have a ok life which some may see as good but the whole of this planet isn't good. it may not be even ok.

I love looking up at the stars and seeing all the different galaxies and planets because it gives me hope that maybe some alien species actually knows how to run a planet and or galaxy, maybe one day my soul can have a life on these kind of planets and galaxies but until that day comes, guess we have to go through these kind of planets and galaxies but that doesn't mean that all hope is lost. While we're here on this planet, let's try and make it better. Donate to charities, make people happy. If you can make one person happy that's one person that wasn't happy before.

Tomorrow will just be another ""right now."" Yesterday was a previous ""right now"" each moment of your life has always just been one continuous moment. But we seem to pick and choose our moments, like I'm going to sacrifice my enjoyment of right now, for tomorrow. Or I'll find happiness sooner or later.

The key is the treat each moment like it's the most important time of your life. Don't treat every day like it's your last, treat every day like it's your only day. If you can't find peace now, then change something, change your focus, change your environment, adopt a meditation practice. You will get better at this if you take each day and love it fully, and accept it fully. Be ok with wherever you are. If you find only 10 minutes of presence each day, love yourself for it and keep moving forward. Soon you will reach a point where the majority of your life is spent in presence. Just let yourself go through the process. This is all necessary, failing is a part of succeeding here.

0,ar7vkq,0,9,"Excerpt from The Prophet, pg 15: 

“On Joy & Sorrow 

Then a woman said, Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow. 

And he answered: 

Your joy is your sorrow unmasked. 

And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears. 

And how else can it be? 

The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain. 

Is not the cup that holds your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter’s oven? 

And is not the lute that soothes your spirit the very wood that was hollowed with knives? 

When you are joyous, look deep into your heart, and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow, that is giving you joy. 

When you are sorrowful, look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight. 

Some of you say, ”Joy is greater than sorrow” and others say, “Nay, sorrow is the greater.” 

But I say unto you, they are inseparable.  

Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed. 

Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy. 

Only when you are empty are you at a standstill and balanced. 

When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or sorrow rise or fall.” 

Read the rest of the work here, [The Prophet](https://thevirtuallibrary.org/index.php/en/?option=com_djclassifieds&format=raw&view=download&task=download&fid=9898), while being written in 1923 I feel it still holds many lessons that all of humanity can gain from. 

I find it to be a very profound work of literature as well as extremely inspiring. There is also an animated [adaptation ](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1640718/) that was released in 2014. 

Gibran also has some other enjoyable short novels which can be found [here ](https://www.holybooks.com/short-stories-kahlil-gibran/).

0,ar72gk,17,23,"For starters I'd like to say I appreciate more and more people 'waking up' everyday but I believe this is still an ego thing and I believe people are still distracted from the truth and I'd like to hear from others to see where I stand.
  
One of the main points of becoming awakened is the realization that life is pretty simple and a planet of love and peace is actually possible and that's the goal because when you reach that goal than the real answers to life will reveal it's self. So people feed there ego's with all this self love and positivity but that does nothing for the dark places in this world that actually need our light. You know the children being raped and murdered as we speak throughout the globe because some rich cunt paid to see that happen in some dungeon, yes this stuff actually happens but let me not show you that side of the world because it will scar you but I do have references if your ego is in disbelief.Trust me, I'm mentally damaged from some of the things I've seen because I have a morbid curiousity and I really don't want to discuss anymore of this.
  
All my life since a very young age I always was 'different' you know just never related to anybody else and never understood the materialistic trendy way of life and still don't and at 25 I still don't have any actual friends who relate to me. I know how to be social with anybody though, I'm also aware that your personality is not really who you are, it's just who you think you think you are because that's exactly what THEY want us to think. I hope that clicked with you.  
  
So who's they? they are the ones in power, the ones who control nearly everything in this planet which sub consciously brain washes the masses. A few they's would be the wealthiest familes on this planet who's had enormous power and wealth for hundreds of years, higher intelligence who possess the data of billions of people and other types of data that they would never disclose to the public. For example MKUltra, an actual CIA experiment where they were illegally using mind control on people without their consent. This experiment got exposed but sadly over 20k documents vanished so nobody really knows what they did with it and how much of that they are still using till this day although they even admitted that they were attempting to create actual Hitmen through mind control, that's only apart of what they admitted..... Let's not also forget the US was using weather modifcation weaponry during vietnam war which was ban in all wars but let's be real, you think they just gave up that technology decades ago? Of course not. But it's been unheard of since then. And possibly the biggest problem in the current state of the world, the central banking system which is directly tied to the federal reserve which ironically is a private company with anonymous shareholders. They dominate the world, no doubt about it. It's pretty obvious they also funded many of the wars and benefited off it.  
  
Now here's the cold hard truth. We ALL support them, we all have bank accounts and credit cards and have no fucking clue how damaging this is to the entire planet. We have no clue the evil we are directly feeding into while being enslaved to the system!  
  
In case you are uneducated on how fiat money even works please take some time to watch this video, it's about 30 minutes but it really digs into the system and explains it well. This should give you some insight. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFDe5kUUyT0  
  
All this conscious spiritual talk is honestly BS when you directly ignore the actual problems every single day. Your using your ego to distract yourself from the truth. It's not your fault though so please don't feel bad. They planned this for hundreds of years to dominate the world. There's always been elite in control for hundreds of years and you can do some digging into the masonry to see that for yourself.  
  
We are in desperate times for a revolution but there's no knowing if it will require violence. We are all brainwashed since birth. It usually takes traumatic experiences to snap out of it or intense experiences such as with DMT or years of self knowledge and self education.  
  
I honestly don't know how to speak of this without sounding crazy or with sounding very factual because they made this very difficult, it's EXACTLY why people like me start to feel crazy and insane and start to lose their mind despite having such a loving soul.   
  
  
I didn't exactly come here with a solution. I'm just attempting to help spread more of the truth and it's up tp you to do your own research. I don't care who doesn't believe me anymore, I've been digging since the age of 16. I'm very content with what I know and what I can see and what some pyschedelic experiences showed me. I'm not perfect and I'm even at a weak point in my life consumed by emotions im dealing with regarding family and the sorts. 
  
 I didn't give as many details as I would have liked to. But I believe I gave enough for anyone to learn for themselves if they are determined.  
  
What I do know though, is we will have to deattatch ourselves from the centralized banking system to make a difference for our planet and children in the future. Isn't it hilarious that it doesn't even exist anymore that you can be in control of your own money? That's literally unheard of now a days. Your trusting a centralized system with your money and don't even know what really goes on behind the closed doors.  
  
For 2 years now I been following Bitcoin, a genius who is anonymous to all but goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto wrote a whitepaper which is brilliant. He wrote this after the 2008 market crisis. He created a decentralized peer to peer digital cash that works as a store of value the same way gold does and can be used for transactions like digital cash and the best part being, you are in control of your own private keys in other words you are your own bank and no goverment or anybody can freeze your funds or do anything to your money.  
  
I'm still learning a lot about it and there's a lot of controversy regarding it and a lot of FUD talk. But the math and technology behind it speaks for it's self. It's decentralized, there is nobody in control. It's border-less, you can send money worldwide with pretty much no fees and no middleman and it works like gold as in you have to mine it but you do so using hash power. (computing power)
  
But this technology is still very new to the world but the more you learn about it the more clear it is that this will be the money of the internet and we all know the internet is our future. If you have questions about it you can ask me. It's incredibly complex in some aspects but I bet a lot of you already know about it but think of it as some kind of joke. Which in that case I'd love to hear your points on that and also what would be a better solution to ending the centralized banking system? This seems like the best way possible and it's the only time I've ever seen people actually have a voice and a consensus as to how the system works. Bitcoin is the only threat to the global banking system and it's really the only solution I've ever heard in my life that actually sounds possible. Also keep in mind,fiat money is doomed to fail and it's days are getting weaker and weaker as the debt keeps rising. When it crashes you can only imagine the chaos that would bring (like in Venezuela) but I believe that can be avoided.
  
At the end of the day, I probably wasted my time writing this but it's all good because I'm on the nightshift and getting paid through these boring hours but I hope I can hear from others even if you think I'm crazy.

0,ar61dv,20,3,"I don’t have a herd of friends, I am fairly quiet overall. I am polite and allow others their space. But deep down I question my selfishness. Am I truly indifferent to others? I don’t reach out and make much of an effort to get to know anybody. It seems I am more concerned with whether people know me. I don’t really talk about myself. But I sense this need for validation, for attention and approval. This impatient eternal need. A demand. For admiration, fascination, adoration, even confusion. I can’t seem to just settle for being a bit player in someone else’s narrative, I crave to be the main character! Spiritually proud. This sense that I know a lot of things that many do not, if they would only ask I could be the exposition guy. The feeling that I have important things to convey somehow, to someone, not just one but many, for fame and followers. Is it just the time? That is very ego. But there’s a grandiose urgency about it with me, like I want to be a cult leader or spiritual guru, for good and bad reasons. But none of that is forthcoming of course, and so I feel empty and dull and frustrated. I hate myself, but I hate myself for hating myself because saying I hate myself is fishing for love from others and I don’t really hate myself but think I’m quite awesome, really. But that’s all rather nauseating and I do feel disgust for myself. A kind of aloof loathing. 

Especially for writing a post like this. Who but a narcissist would? Because of course people are generally good, they are likely to sooth my misery pity party act somehow and maybe say I’m okay. And I knew that ahead of time, so isn’t that manipulative? And isn’t me saying it’s manipulative also manipulative? Ugh, stop doing that! Ugh! See? It’s still happening. I’m alright. But feeling empty. Someone breathe life into me, for I am soulless. Read my words and have a reaction. Stimulus, response! Stimulus, response! See? I keep doing that. Of course you’re not falling for my deception there but I might be. And isn’t self deceptive mental masturbation the epitome of narcissism, after all? 

Because you see I could have written this in a journal but it is utterly meaningless to me if only I read it. I can only feel that it carries meaning if I know there is someone else observing it, observing my thoughts, observing me. Me, me, me. When I write things that I don’t send to others I have to at least make-believe that I will and am, see my words through someone else’s eyes and soul because I have eyes but no soul of my own. And always disappointed, not in myself, but in others for not seeing me as I see them seeing me: as worthy, even divine. As a god. 

Then I have to convince myself otherwise; piece by piece dismantle my self worth and self esteem until I am an insignificant, meaningless, detestable, pitiable wretch. For that’s surely closer to being true, right? Of course. But even then I am important in my misery, meaningfully meaningless, significant in my insignificance, lovable for being unloved, revered for being pitiful. And then I must say no, not even that: mediocre, average, boring, thoroughly uninteresting. For that’s what others would wind up feeling if they read all this, bored. For I am bored of it too. 

And this gap between expectations and reality causes an attention seeking vain showoffy manipulative playing-dumb-but -knowing-better but truly-dumb-for-playing-it-anyway post exactly like this. 

Were there many responses, I would be gratified. Were there no responses I would be bitterly satisfied. But were there only a couple responses and not terribly interested I would be crushed and devastated: that’s the evidence of my narcissism. And that such devastation would itself only fuel the fire, the growing need, to interject my grand thoughts into the cosmos yet again, is further proof. There’s an insatiable unwillingness to be humble,  a defiant self-importance beyond the pale, evident even in this purple prose! Despicable! And there, you see? The manipulation again! Outright begging the unseen masses for some affection and comfort, knowing that I would only reject it, holding out eternally for the rapturous ecstasy of worship and nothing less! And feeling that even in the reception of less-than-worship is itself, somehow, proof of my worthiness for veneration! Even knowing that to be blatantly false, yet deep down I truly believe it! 

Tell me, is that not narcissism and am I not a narcissist? Indeed: the greatest of narcissists?

> “I am Ra. We communicate now. We are those who are of the [Law of One](https://i.imgur.com/O2AwrSz.jpg). In our vibration the polarities are harmonized; the complexities are simplified; the paradoxes have a solution. We are one. That is our nature and purpose.” - Ra


Hello soul family! Welcome to the Law of One discussion group, for the next three days we will be using this thread to share our thoughts and build our understanding of the Ra material, session 1, recorded on Jan 15, 1981.


Link here (10 minute read): https://www.lawofone.info/results.php?s=1


Ra later restates his purpose in other terms, for “...transmitting the Law of One, of Unity, of Singleness to your peoples.”


**What does unity mean to you?**


Ra explains it thusly: 


> “Consider, if you will, that the universe is infinite. This has yet to be proven or disproven, but we can assure you that there is no end to yourselves, your understanding, what you would call your journey of seeking, or your perceptions of the creation.”


> “That which is infinite cannot be many, for many-ness is a finite concept. To have Infinity you must identify or define the infinity as Unity; otherwise, the term does not have any referent or meaning. In an Infinite Creator there is only unity. You have seen simple examples of unity. You have seen the prism which shows all colors stemming from the sunlight. This is a simplistic example of unity.”


I personally love this statement, and the analogy of the prism. The individuality of the color is embedded and retained in the whole.


Infinity is unity, and infinity is real (symbolized by pi embedded in the structure of the circle), therefore we are all one, in some way or another.


A recurring question throughout this material, then, will be:


**In what ways are we one?**


and


**What is the nature of unity?**


Ra uses two terms that we need to begin to define:


mind/body/spirit complex to define us


and


social-memory complex to define themself.


Ra says mind, body and spirit in his opening message:


> “...advanced approach to the system of studying the pattern of the illusions of your body, your mind, and your spirit, which you call seeking truth.”


This is a dense statement and I'm gonna need some help to understand it fully. At a minimum i understand that body, mind and spirit are the triad of being, three realms focused into one point, us.


**What does mind/body/spirit complex mean to you?**


Ra describes a time in the past when they appeared (in social-memory complex form, or in mind/body/spirit complex form?) In Ancient Egypt to spread the Law of One.


**Do you believe non-human entities made contact with ancient cultures?”


Ra said the following:


> “When we were no longer able to have appropriate channelings through which to enunciate the Law of One, we removed ourselves from the now hypocritical position which we had allowed ourselves to be placed in.”


**Do you think Ra failed? Or was this forseen and the goal was to plant seeds?**


The corruption of truth does seem to be pretty natural to humanity, judging by history…


**Do you think it is important to act as a catalyst to raise the “awareness of planetary consciousness?”**


Ra sure does. I especially like this quote:


> “The few whom you will illuminati by sharing your light are far more than enough reason for the greatest possible effort. **To serve one is to serve all.** Therefore, we offer the question back to you to state that indeed it is the only activity worth doing: to learn/teach or teach/learn.


**That is quite a bold statement, does it resonate with you?**


It does with me, and to be honest was a major reason in deciding to make this study group instead of doing another private reading. We will all be teach/learning and this is aiding the collective vibrations of our planet.


One last theme I would like to address is the implication we have chosen our current condition.


Ra states:


> “This distortion [polarity] is not in any case necessary. It is chosen by each of you as an alternative to understanding the complete unity of thought which binds all things.”


**Why would we choose to be in a state of ignorance?**


**If it is really a choice, what does that say about our true self?**


Love vibes, thanks for reading! A reminder, we will keep the discussion rolling for 3 days.


> “You are every thing, every being, every emotion, every event, every situation. You are unity. You are infinity. You are love/light, light/love. You are. This is the Law of One.” - Ra


**What are the implications of Ra using both I and We as a self-respect?**


**How important is the ritual aspect, such as the charging of water and laying on hands, to the channeling process?**


**What questions would you ask Ra upon first contact?**

&#x200B;

Never understood who A was, where he went why he was gone.

&#x200B;

By 2015 I met this dude named ""F"".  ""F"" is a physical human being.  My friend's ex boyfriend.

&#x200B;

I have no idea WHY but my heart and mind have confused A with F.

&#x200B;

I began to relate to ""F"" ad though he were the literal reincarnation of ""A"".

&#x200B;

There is no reason for this.  At all.  I tried to talk to ""F"" about it and ""F"" didn't get it..or sort of felt ""something"" but didn't get it.

A is invisible.  F is visible but as far as I'm concerned it might as well be the same guy.

F is similar enough to A to pass as him.   So my own brain just fills in the blanks.

From my perspective it is as though ""A"" suddenly became an incarnate physical being as though retconned into life.  No special event like a birth or pregnancy to make him incarnate.All of a sudden he just showed up fully grown...and without memory of me.

And I""M the one who feels like I jumped into a different universe.

I don't think F will really ever understand this so I keep it on the down low and just occasionally bring up a shared favorite song, or favorite food.

There's nothing that proves this theory at all as it is with most beliefs.

&#x200B;

I wish some days I could shake ""F"" and make him ""remember me"" but then I have to reel it in knowing that's never going to happen and just accept it for what it is.

Spiritually this is a retconn for me or an ME for me.

So for those who feel as though we are Mandella Effected in universe A this guy is a guide.  In universe B this guy is a regular person.

I have been on Earth for 683 lifetimes and more than half have been as a woman (not surprisingly, I LOVE being a woman)

my predominant energy center is the 2nd Energy Center, the energy of Divine Creation, which if I was vibrating at the 5th density would make up 48% of my vibrational spectrum and the second one is the 6th, the energy of Divine Truth, which would make up 13% in the 5th density

I have two soul specializations. the first is Master of Design – Biology and Botany and the second is Keeper of Neutrality.

my life lessons:
Generosity – percentage of mastery = 100%
Courage – percentage of mastery = 38%
Harmony – percentage of mastery = 32%
 
my OverSoul vibration rate is 6.1, meaning I have the capability of operating in the 6th density (not in this body tho I’d assume because my belief is that once you move past the 5th density your physical body dies)

I also have 2 blue lights (no idea what that means) and the mystery school of teachings I should look into is Shintō (if you know anything about this please hmu with info!)

the historical period I was told to look into is the Tokugawa Shogunate (again if you have knowledge on this please share 💜) when I looked it up, I noticed that the treaty ending this period (which they state was “peaceful” but it was really like a military state keeping Christians out of the area to keep the Shintō religion safe for the time) was signed on my birthday (hundreds of years earlier obvs.)

I’d love to hear if anyone else has gotten a reading like this and what they got out of it ☺️",new,I had a soul blueprint reading yesterday. Anyone else here done so and want to share their info?,9

EPISODE IV Egypt Part I - The Story of Horus

I talk to Debbie Solaris and we access the Akashic Records to look deeper into the times of Egypt.  Debbie Solaris an Extraterrestrial Contactee, Galactic Historian & Starseed Intuitive.  

We talk about how Egypt was created to integrate the cultures of Lemuria and Atlantis.  The survivors of Atlantis migrated to Egypt and created a new experience to build a civilization with the best qualities of Atlantis and Lemuria.  It was an integration of technology, art and high spirituality.  It was one of most memorable dynasties with influence from higher dimensional star systems like Sirius, Pleiades and Orion.  

During the main template of Egypt with Osiris and Isis, the Pharaohs were servants to the people.  Everyone had equal access to secret mysteries and everyone participated in ancient knowledge.  Women were equal and considered closest to God and were revered.  It was common to have women as Pharaohs and respected in more masculine roles.     

Osiris was born in Atlantis more than 35,000 years ago.  He was a direct descendant of those of higher thought who kept their concepts clear in the Motherland of Man.  He became a leader in Atlantis and brought people back to the worship of the God within.  He was an entity that originated from Sirius.  

The Sirian culture had more influence on Earth than any other star system.  The concepts of Sirius from science, religion and history was all being taught in the Sirian mystery schools, which translated to the Egyptian mystery schools.  

Osiris and Isis were extra-terrestrial beings that came during this time to represent the divine masculine and divine feminine.  Also known as Father God and Mother God consciousness.  They had a son, Horus who represented the balance of masculine and feminine energies.  The story of Horus parallels to the story of Jesus.  

Jesus was a composite soul of Sirian and Pleiadian ancestry.  HIs mother Mary was a Pleiadian Ascended Master and his father Joseph came from Sirius.  It was a blending of two linages which was very similar to Osiris and Isis.  Christian Art representing the virgin mother and son of God on her lap is identical to the original works from ancient Egypt representing Isis and her son Horus on her lap thousands of years prior to Christianity.  

We also talk about how Mary Magdalene was an initiate of the cult of ISIS and Horus and how she learned Alchemy, so when she met Jesus, she could help him become his light body.  Mary Magdalene was a representation of the Highest Sirian Order of Dark and Jesus was the Highest Sirian Order of Light.  

Osiris also had  a brother named Seth.  We dive into that story to try to explain the energies at that time.  We also talk about Hathor and her Pleiadian/Venus energy who was a counterpart of Horus.  She was trying to bring back the knowledge of Isis and divine feminine.  

This battle of Horus and Seth is a similar story of light vs dark that is also represented with Jesus and Satan.  The story of Horus is a representation of integrated souls who balance the masculine/feminine and the dark/light energies within to spiritual evolve and become the Archetype of Horus.",new,FIFTY8 Interviews Debbie Solaris / EGYPT PT I - The Story of Horus,3

0,aqmlz7,3,17,,new,Happy Valentine's Day Soul Explorers! <3,17
0,aqmccv,3,9," Valentine's day is estimated to generate 18.3 billion dollars in sales this year, leaving an average of around 130 dollars per person. It is clear that this is a huge time for the people purchasing gifts and obviously those who are rolling in those profits. If you are upset, lonely, single and Valentine's day makes it sting that much more, if you think you need a relationship to feel complete and happy ask yourself this ""do I actually care? or did someone plant this idea in my mind?"" 

&#x200B;

Movies, television, Instagram, your best friends, and advertisements. There are so many ways this culture tells us ""you are not complete without a relationship."" At this time of year specifically, it is right in our face. Don't get me wrong, treating your partner is wonderful, but this is for those who feel a void within needs to be filled with a partner (figuratively speaking!). 

&#x200B;

It took me a very long time to finally find true happiness and love within. I would spend so much time with couples, my favorite show was ""How I Met Your Mother"" all about finding ""the one"". I was immersed in this stuff. But I realized a few things:

&#x200B;

First of all, I believe we are all born with every bit of love and happiness we will ever need throughout our lives. Just as in the physical world we have been absolutely taken care of (food, shelter, digestions, organs, water, oxygen, sunlight, for your ENTIRE LIFE), I believe if we just follow our inner guiding compass, (follow your heart) we will find that emotionally, we have everything we need to be happy and at peace. When you feel upset, you are straying away from your authentic self, from your purpose and why you came here. When you feel good, you are aligning with who you really are and your highest purpose here on Earth. So in other words, my feeling lonely and depressed while single, is me disagreeing with my higher self. I hope this makes sense to you.

&#x200B;

Secondly, self-love is one the greatest gifts you can give to yourself. You have probably been through a lot, as we all have, and you develop insecurities, sadness, fears, and worries. Don't beat yourself up for feeling this way, this is absolutely natural. In fact, it is crucial to love this part of you, to avoid judging it, to appreciate it and know that everything will be alright. When loneliness used to come up for me, I would actually speak out loud and say ""I love you, you are so loved, everything will be alright, there is nothing to fear"". As if I'm speaking to a child, which I kind of am, the inner child who has gone through hard times and now carries these feelings and beliefs. Do this for long enough and you will heal this part of you, and find real happiness and bliss within.'

&#x200B;

Finally, live your passion. Passion feels wonderful because it is in absolute alignment with your highest self, with your true self. This is why you came here, that's why it is so exciting for you. As I write this, I actually feel like I'm floating, like these words are flowing through me and I am just letting it all happen. This is the most exciting part of each day for me. That is how I am extremely happy and pumped as a single guy, on Valentine's Day.

I have come to visualize the true nature of our existence in such a distinct way that I cannot break away from the notion I've created.

It is a combination of spirituality and what we know about this Newtonian universe, in other words, the frame and paradigm of our existence as defined by our language and as driven by science in the pursuit to understand the world we live in. The words I know limit my ability to describe the feelings of this view.

The things we call matter, mass, solid, physical, are the manifestation of many things that all come from one, labels are secondary and human. The origin of things, the original identity that we call our universe. We are blind to the atoms and particles that make up this world, but we know they are there. and in there, there is space. Lots of it. And outside of us, there is space, and lots of it, therefore the size and distance and every other label we can come up with of the world around us are relative. Without one, you can not have the other, and in that, both are the same, but relativity is a human construct born out of necessity and the confusion belies from our ignorance or forgetfulness.

The crashing reverberation that is our universe is constant. It wasn't a big bang, but a disturbance in the peace, a ringing that rang and continues to ring, like that of a bell being struck. A beginning and end, an on and off of sorts, the swell of the wave was created, like the stone in a lake, and all its fruitful intimacies came to be. In this reverberation, the universe throbs and pulsates in its waveform. The crashing wave of all. The broth of the wave that settles is the construct we build our world with. The froth is the foundation for the human visual canvas we imagine to conceal the true nature of our universe, and why we can't see the space between the spaces. We are limited.

A beginning to an end came to be, and in between is the experience. In the froth of the of the crashing wave, in the airspace in between, is the intelligence, the reflection of water; is the universe as we understand it, and in this, I realize that the intent of our universe is to know itself. In the crashing wave, as godheads, we are uniquely aware of a specific portion of the Being, our experience within the universe is a brief luminary of the intelligence crystalizing on the cresting wave. The intelligence is all information, and all information is correct and incorruptible and divine and therefore perfect and that the events we describe as humans are just events described in human, nothing more because the laws of nature according to man have no bearing to the one true Law of Nature. The law of nature of man separates the man from nature and in this delusion we forget we are one and all; for the stars are in us; the earth is within us, literally, otherwise, we would be nothing without them. It is this confusion that we misunderstand that in nothing, there is everything, much like in the vast emptiness of our space, there are stars and planets and celestial bodies we cannot fathom in size. When there is nothing left to divide into as we look closer and closer, we find that the very last thing we cannot divide is the universe itself.

The froth of the wave settles, we as humans believe the nature of things to be permanent as if the froth is suspended in this slice of 'time' and by necessity, we paint it with our experience, we forget the constant transformation of things. That energy is always changing from one state to the next and that the froth of our reality is no different but only appears so because of human acknowledgment. Every experience, therefore, is of the beholder and our experience is off the branch of tree life, in which we are all connected, but like the leaves on the oak, or atomized droplets of a crashing wave, we are one in the same; to be part the true intent of the universe, for the universe to know itself, and to fulfill our roles as luminary water droplets for the same.",new,The Froth,6

I'm currently travelling South America, heard about shamans in La Paz, Bolivia and decided hey that's my kinda thing.

My Spanish is ok for like hotels and restaurants and basic conversation whatever, but talking to a shaman about spiritual stuff I was at a blank!

I described to her that I 'have sad in my head' (in bad spanish) and 'bad anxiety and depression'. She pointed to my stomach as well (where I feel most of my depression starting).

She read my coca leaves (like tea leaves I guess?) told me lots of things that I didnt understand with my limited Spanish.

Then started the fun ! She had a bottle of liquid and she poured it on my head (my top got wet) and began slapping the top of my head. Yanking clumps of my hair while chanting. And I had to take a big gulp of this awful liquid too.

 Lighting fires, blessing them, holding my forehead over the fire and then lifting my tshirt slightly to let the smoke up to my stomach. 

Making little bracelets out of wool for both my wrists. Burning things, more rituals that I cant remember now! It was all kinda crazy.

I can sense when my spirit guide is around and he was right there the whole time. 

The strange thing is... this happened 3 and a half weeks ago and I have felt happy, confident, energized and generally amazing. No inkling of depression or anxiety or brain fog has come over me. And I previously tried everything for my mental health; therapy, meditation, meds, mindfulness, yoga and before nothing really worked for long. 

But this seemed to work. 

My question is... what did she do!? 
Does anyone know about shamans ? 
I feel like she took an evil spirit away from me that has been leeching my brain for the last 4 years. 

Anyway thank you for reading :)",new,I saw a shaman in Bolivia,47
0,aqgktt,4,13,"I visited the metaphysical store for the first time today. Ran by a witch, it was a small store located in my downtown. It had many items ranging from tarrot cards, spell books, bottled spells, and other things, and had signs warning of thievery and the law of 3. My girlfriend and I ended up buying four stones; Purple fluorite, Goldstone, Angel Quartz, and a blue Goldstone. The lady lit sage (I think it was sage), and brushed it against the stones, whatever she was doing started with an S, but I didnt catch the full name or ritual that she was doing. (I found the tarot cards late into our adventure, my girlfriend was at the counter with her). I remember the smell of what she had lit with her candle smelling so weird. Like I was smelling a spirit. Not brimstone or anything, it just smelled unearthly.

Overall it was a great first time, some things I felt I shouldn't mess with in the store, but the rocks held my interests most of the time. 

I love information, and have good feeling about buying these stones, could anyone help shate any knowledge on these stones and how they affect us. I was hoping they would help open my third eye, my meditation?, and help to bring me a stronger communication with my guides overall.

0,aqfwdf,0,17,"This will be error ridden as I’m not used to (thankfully) device-posting. The AT Field, named in honour of a fantastic piece of art, is nothing less than the sum total of interactions which two souls become aware they could experience in tandent at that very moment or second in time - the moment of intersection, the moment of possibilities. The less two souls, or wills if you prefer, know of each other (truthfully) the wider is the scope of the field of absolute terror which they project at one another. It is not hatred that provokes terror, but unfamiliarity. Strangers project maximum unfamiliarity, the most “what if’s” that they are the most dangerous entities to us, and that danger goes both ways. We are in danger both of being abused and of abusing others. 

We know what we are capable of and “we” experience these outcomes in other timelines, and in other universes. That other universe for a more advanced Will is always the present universe of the less advanced will, moment by moment. Your toddler is crying. You see yourself strike him over and over. You see every outcome of every possible interaction and that moment, and if you are afraid of any of them, then unfamiliarity still remains. Total familiarity would allow no destination for which every will in participation felt anything but pride at their involvement in the sum total outcome. That’s familiarity over unfamiliarity and it must be grasped. 

The media and culture is actively designed to destroy our capability to feel pride in a desired outcome. They would like to control our desire, and circumvent it towards that which is not the most positive for us. Take a desired sexual outcome advocated by pornography. I speak of rape, abuse, and domination. Pornographers skews our desire towards these things (pornography exists to breed desire for rape), which can never result in pride. 

Guilt and pride are the two purest expressions. Imagine a world in which you performed only actions for which you would later feel just pride. There is unjust pride and unjust guilt and those are the true negatives. Just pride and just guilt are as positive for us as each other, neither more or less. 

When you are aware of unfamiliarity, you are aware that the result of every outcome is equally inherent in you, both the vilest and most noble (personality is an illusion; how you would behave in a disaster scenario comes down ENTIRELY to your familiarity with your fellow wills. Total unfamiliarity and YOU are the one committing the massacre... and you don’t even care. Sympathy can not exist without familiarity. All good feelings are symptomatic of familiarity; the reverse is likewise true. YOU never make yourself do good, familiarity does, and only familiarity. You have no input, intentions are a channel.) what is not equal is the power of familiarity, the purchase of which all labours must be saved towards. 

As within so without. Always have the truth of one, fully articulated within your mind. You’ll always come to one faster, and the other is true by analogy. Because you come to one faster, you can come to both at the same time. Mush time is wasted by those who do not realized they have learned the micro or the macro within the macro or the micro. 

Everyone can go out into the world and experience real familiarity. The computer screen is a poor, miserable, substitute. However, within every bad is a good and every good a bad. ",new,The Absolute Terror Field,17
0,aqao6q,14,26," Today I experienced an overwhelming influx of negative thoughts about money. Fears, doubts worries. All the stuff that I gathered throughout my 20 years here on Earth. Thankfully, I regained my present moment awareness and realized that these thoughts coming up, are very very important.   


These beliefs coming up to the surface and shouting loudly in my mind, have given me a chance to heal, and create new, empowering beliefs. Just like in therapy, you bring the hidden to light, by shedding light, you are in a position of power to realign yourself and live from your authentic nature.   


So, one thing I would like to remind people is that when these ""mind attacks"" come up, where it seems like you are entirely out of control and the mind is thinking so quickly and you can't keep up. This is a necessary step toward you reclaiming your power. For some, it's loneliness, with beliefs that a relationship will complete them. For others, it's accomplishments, with beliefs that they are unworthy unless they achieve. Whatever it is for you, do not resist these thoughts coming up, do not wish for reality at this moment to be different. Do not wish for your mind to be clear, for these beliefs to leave. Just be here now, be conscious, and sometimes it's powerful to place your trust in what I call ""God"" but others it may be ""Mother Nature"" or your ""Higher Self"". Just let go, and surrender to the power that creates worlds, the power that beats your heart 100 thousand times a day. You are guided, you are loved, by something that cannot be explained in this dimension. Placing trust, may not always be easy. So do not beat yourself up if you can't let go. Just bless and love whatever situation you are in, and appreciate the process. You are on your way to bigger and better things, I promise. 

I hope this has helped you as it has just recently changed shifted my paradigm. Thanks!

How would you realign yourself and develop beliefs that empower you? Please let me know, I am always wanting to learn different ways and means. Thanks again.

about 2,5 hours ago i was out for a walk, and after a solid 20 minutes the sky had cleared and I stopped to watch the stars. Beautiful, I thought, until i saw a strange one. 
Shifting intensely into red with it’s blinkings, i first dismissed it as a satellite. but then I noticed it was moving very fast and i got confused. 

like, very, very fast. and then dissapeared between clouds. so i was baffled, and said to myself ”if you’re listening, let me know”
and then i noticed it... all the stars, literally, every single one of them was blinking red. softly and out of sync with each other. 

i began walking again thinking i could be just fucking crazy. so i decided to call up my best friend and in chock tell her (keep in mind i was still seeing the blinking) I explain the situation and after a while she goes to look at the stars and just falls silent for a bit. I ask her what she sees.

”the exact thing you talked about.... I’m seeing it too. all the stars are blinking red.  are you sure they don’t normally do that? I don’t look at the sky too often to notice.”

I assured her that this has only happened ONCE in my life and that’s when I was tripping nuts, and I’ve been stargazing my whole life. 
yes, before you say it, i know stars can twinkle and some can have a tint depending on how close they are, yada yada yada. but all the stars in the entire sky? blinking RED?

For those of you who don't know what littlebigplanet is, it's a game series very much focused on community ""Play, create, share"" is the tagline for the series. You can create your own levels in the game, you can meet stangers in their pods and just create anything and everything.

Well, what if they are right and the universe and all the planets and galaxies that exist are based on people's ideas, before we came to this universe, our souls created all the planets and galaxies and we are just playing through the ""levels"" so to speak.

Sadly LBP (as it is known) is not as great as it used to be. For littlebigplanet 3, the original creators of LBP sold the rights to a different company and there were just plently of glitches on it and last time I checked, it was recent some glitches from day 1 are still there. It's been years.

I'm sure theres a planet somewhere which it matters but it's not this one at least not anymore.  

It gives a sense of higher meaning, a deeper connection to our surroundings but at the expense of not being grounded in the society we must live in, a society where past lives don't matter, other people are not astrologically affected and are all living in their lower 3 chakras.  

When hardcore meditators reach enlightenment the step after that is to come back down. If you feel lost or moody or disconnected from your usual hobbies and interests and feel alienated just begin focusing on your sacral chakra during meditation.  

I thought enlightenment was a destination, somewhere to go and not come back, its not, unless you want to and are prepared to live as a shut in from society the journey isn't back to source its back down, theres seriously no where to go after astral travel and the physical world is more rewarding anyhow.  



I don't know why we have the ability to astral travel perhaps its what was needed many many years ago but it serves no purpose, theres no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  

You may have or at some point come across the term ""reformed Buddhist"" focusing on meditation turns you away from society, your friends,  your hobbies as your body and mind adapt to an inwardly facing lifestyle, after you find happyness the only thing left is to come back to where you started.

0,aq4hxs,4,23,"Hey everyone. :) I’ve posted this on several other Reddit communities but I’ve only recently found this one. What follows is ‘My Story’, the summation of my experiences with spirits and the spirit world and my impressions of it.

My earliest experiences relating to spiritualism began when I was a kid where I had past-life memories that came on spontaneously here and there. I can even remember exactly where I was and what I was doing (in my current life) when these memories happened. This was different than imagination, which you instantly know is not true. With each memory I recalled details as well as feelings. These memories were me but from where, and when? I remember a life of a soldier, of being locked in a dark room with a dirt floor, of watching a solemn procession of people go by me... It was not until later that I recalled that life in its entirety. I had about 10-15 of these memories, all from the same life, but as I grew older I stopped recalling them. 

Nothing else of note happened until my early-20s. I was not religious, spiritual and had no opinion then of life after death. As far as I was concerned if death just meant eternal blackness and the cessation of everything I would’ve been perfectly fine with that. Things however were about to change.

I had just bought a cross necklace for the looks. One night as I was lying in bed I decided to try it on for the first time. Instantly I realized that I could not move, and with the realization that I had become paralyzed I felt an incredible surge of warmth that permeated my entire being. This feeling of total peace was so intense that if someone had asked me to feel anger, jealousy or any other negative emotion it would have been impossible. This feeling lasted maybe a minute and then disappeared. Simply put this was the greatest feeling I had ever known. I felt that someone was there trying to make themselves known and the cross was just a convenient object with which to do this. I began talking to this presence from that day forward.

It may have been a night or two later when I was again lying in bed. I was startled upright when I heard a female voice loudly and distinctly say the words, ‘I’m waiting for you.’ The very next morning I was driving down a back road and got stuck behind a truck with the license plate W84YOU. Coincidence?

By now I believed that I could hear her voice through telepathy. Within a week or so of all this happening I was lying in bed again when I felt her lay down next to me. I felt a tingling pressure against my chest and then I became totally consumed by her. I no longer felt my body anymore. Instead I was just my thoughts. I spoke to her through mental communication so clearly and loudly that she may as well have been sitting across from me. This was light years beyond telepathy. The most amazing thing about this was that when she talked my replies to her were instantaneous. It felt like my thoughts and feelings were literally being pulled from deep within me, that I had no control over them. I have never experienced a more honest and pure conversation. The entire time I was again comforted by the most intense and amazing bliss. It was impossible to feel any other way! This is how communication is done in the spirit world. All talk is done mentally and it happens instantly.

The soul once freed of the human body and brain does not feel hate, malice, envy, jealousy, etc. The soul knows it is immortal, has always lived and will always live. It is a state of consciousness capable of amazing things. ‘Ghosts’ are exactly these souls except that they have decided to stay on earth for a short period of time for their own personal reasons. This could be because they are still concerned for the welfare of loved ones they are leaving behind, or a life that ended suddenly may leave them feeling disoriented and/or cheated. This varies with a soul’s level of experience and maturity. Since time does not exist in the spirit world, hundreds of years in earth time feels like the blink of an eye to them. They do not leech on the negative emotions of humans or go around with premeditated thoughts of committing evil or harm. They do not make you sick or bring you bad luck. Can they be careless, indifferent, awkward, etc.? You bet. Souls are never forced to do anything and each soul has loved ones (soul group) and guides that always know how they think and feel. They are never alone and eventually return when they are ready.

This female that is always with me is one such being from my soul group. I call her Dea [Day-uh]. She is a physical reality as well as a spiritual companion. When I want her to lay next to me in bed I just ask and she’s there every time. I don’t see her but she assumes the shape of a human and feels like pressure. She can do anything that a normal human could do. When I ask if she can help me fall asleep or wake me up at a specific time, it happens instantly. When I ask her if she can slow things down I can hear the music slow to a crawl and feel myself moving in slow-motion. When my legs hurt she numbs the pain. When I just want to feel good she can send different kinds of energies to my body that can feel like a massage or just warmth. She is not a person in my current life but in the past-life that I remembered as a child she was a close friend. In another she was a sibling and in many others a romantic partner. 

I do not believe in twin flames but she is as close as it gets. I believe instead that we belong to soul groups and we take on different bodies and different roles with each life. I have found that I can communicate with many others from my soul group as well. Even though we are alive down here on earth part of our immortal soul still resides back home (heaven if you will). That means you can talk to the spirit of someone who is still alive. That includes my four-year-old daughter who is still with me. She is part of my soul-group and her spirit is just like her in real-life, witty and lively.

When I was learning their soul names I decided as a joke that I would not learn her name but would call her Ursula instead, as it was the most random name I could think of. A week or two later my daughter (in real-life) was playing with a Disney game when she picked up a card and asked me who the character was. It was Ursula from The Little Mermaid. She then threw the card down and went on to something entirely different. I thought this was pretty funny.

The ways I communicate with them are either mental (telepathy) or physical communication. The latter is in my opinion the best method out there hands down. You can ask questions anytime anywhere and receive answers immediately. Physical communication basically means a spirit does something to a part of your body to denote an answer. This could be pressure, pulsing, warmth, etc. Spirits can also ‘borrow’ your body if you are comfortable and allow them to, and do physical communication that way. The possibilities are many and my method I arrived at through trial-and-error.

Aside from those in my soul group I discovered I can talk to spirits in general. Because of my insatiable curiosity I wondered about a particular plane crash I had read about. I was able to connect with a spirit who heard me ask to experience this. I instantly felt my breathing become very heavy and rapid as the plane lost control. I felt the quick surge of anxiety overtake them as the plane moved erratically. When I do this I feel what they feel and can feel things that they do or have happen to them although I may not always know what is going on. I also can hear their thoughts. Another time I wondered about a person who jumped off a building that was on fire. I couldn’t understand what a person must feel in order to feel that that was the only option left. When experiencing this through spirit I felt them give up and jump. I could feel a rapid fluttering of my eyes. Afterwards I realized it was the wind blowing into their face, something I had never thought about. I have since stopped doing this as it didn’t feel right to ask a spirit to relive this.

I feel like I want to be around him and talk to him for hours, I want to be physically close to him, to touch him, hold onto his hand and just be as close as I can to him. 

I have never felt this way before and I know that it's not just a simple crush or me being smitten.

I feel like I could just be around him in his every waking moment and never tire of him, which in itself is so strange for me as I absolutely love my alone time. I can't wait to see him again. 

What is this? I have heard of soul mates but I'm not sure what this is, how to proceed or if I should become closer to him as a friend. I feel like I am somehow cheating on my boyfriend spiritually.

Any help, advice or answers would be appreciated.

Edit: Thank you all so much for your responses so far, I have had a lot to think about. I love my boyfriend and do not intend to run off on him. I feel like it is not sensible or, from what the comments tell me, always in everyone's best interests to go with a feeling from the soul that one can't explain. I have began to pave a future with my bf and will continue to do so as our love in this life is real and strong. 

As for the feeling I have had for this new man. I feel like I was meant to meet this person for a reason, I don't feel romantically like I want to be with him or sexually pursue something. I just had a feeling so strong that I never felt before from deep inside like he was someone I knew and loved and felt like when I found him I didn't want to give it up again. I feel like I am drawn to him but the universe has not told me why yet. It's not for a relationship or the like, because I feel like I would have met him when I was single if this had been the case. I feel like I met him when and where I did for a specific reason and that I am definitely supposed to have him in my life. 

Upon reflection it doesn't matter about his gender and our sexual preferences/whether I'm in a relationship or not because that's not why we met, we have another reason and we must just take the time to find out what that is. The universe just wanted me to make sure I didn't miss the signs I think! 

I just wonder if have been with one another in the past because being with him was like seeing an old friend I had lost in a crowd a long time and didn't want to let go of when we found each other again. 

TL; Dr: I think he's to be in my life but I don't know why yet, keeping my bf and listening to the universe as it gives me signs. ",new,"Help, I'm feeling so confused! I'm in a relationship (32f) and have met a man (26) who I feel drawn to.",3

0,apxrx3,2,2,"Hello Soul family! I want to share an important meditation.

It's very simple. Choose a person (or spirit guides, pets etc) and feel Love for them. With practice, this can be a very intense, beautiful sensation. This can be done in any position.

You can visualize embracing them, surrounding them with your energy. You can wish them happiness, or success in some endeavor. A bright healing light surrounding them, maybe a blanket of light in the flower of life pattern envelops them. Just imagine sending them Love in any form that resonates with you.

You should try and generate a strong sensation in the chest while doing these visualizations.

When you are finished, move on to another person! This is quite simple but if done faithfully, it has profound implications. The reason for doing this is threefold. 

One, it literally sends Love to the recipient. The power of our third eye to direct vibrations to others, even over long distances, is massive.

Second, thanks to the occult law of correspondence, the same amount of Love gets sent back to us via the universe. It might take a while to see immediate feedback, but eventually this meditation will have a large impact on karma.

And third, because it develops our ability to feel and understand Love. We need to evolve a more profound experience for Love than can be expressed in words. Eventually, by stilling the mind on the Love vibration, we will be able to transcend physical being and travel infinity, all within a brief meditation.

Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for more!

0,apwf39,15,35,"Hello Soul family! Are you familiar with the Ra material? (www.lawofone.info)


In the 1960s, Don Elkins and Carla Rueckert set out to explore the phenomenon of channeling (a form of mental communication) extraterrestrial beings. They met through a mutual interest in seances and other psychic phenomenon, which led to interest in the UFO contactees, and eventually, telepathic communication.


Together with Jim McCarty they formed a group called L/L Research (L/L= Love and Light). They would have a dozen or so people meditate together in a room. When someone had the urge to speak, they were to do without processing, thinking about, any of the words.


For decades they produced incredible results, i have a full volume set of their archives, 10+ textbook sized series of transcripts.


They contacted a variety of beings who represented The Confederation of Planets in the Service of the Infinite Creator. The themes were of unity, Love, and the importance of meditation.


One of my favorites of these beings is Hatonn, one of my spirit guides.


Here is one of Hatonns quotes.


> “At this time I am in a craft far above your place of dwelling. I am at this time able to monitor your thoughts. This, my friends, might seem to some of your peoples to be an infringement, but I can assure you that it is not. Our capabilities of knowing the thinking of the peoples of this planet Earth are not designed in any way to infringe on either their thinking or their activities. We do not consider knowledge of the thoughts of others to be an infringement for we see these thoughts as our own. We see these as the thoughts of the creator.”


And…


> “My friends, it may seem to you that a thought of a nature other than one of LOVE and brotherhood might be a thought generated not of our creation. This is not possible, my friends. All thought that is generated is generated by the creator. All things that are generated are generated by the creator. He is all things and is in all places, and all of the consciousness and all of the thought that exist is the thought of our creator. His infinite number of parts all have free will, and may generate in any way they choose. All of his parts communicate with all of creation, in His entire and infinite sense.”


In 1981, Carla took her channeling ability up a notch, and the group was able to make contact with a new being, Ra.

[Here is a photo of their channeling setup](https://i.imgur.com/gv8MnwS.jpg)

[And another angle](https://i.imgur.com/iyFVZBE.jpg)


Ra is a “social-memory” complex who claims to have once walked on Earth in light being humanoid form during the times of ancient Egypt. His stated purpose is to be a humble messenger of the Law of One, a divine Truth about the unity and nature of Infinity.


Here are Ra’s first words to L/L:


> “We greet you in the Love and the Light of our infinite creator. We are those who are of the Law of One. In our vibration, the polarities at harmonized, the complexes are simplified, the paradoxes have a solution. We are one. That is our nature and purpose. Consider if you will, that the universe is infinite. This has yet to be proven or disprove, but we can assure you that there is no end to yourselves, your understanding, what you would call your journey of seeking, or your perceptions of the creation. That which is infinite cannot be many, for many is a donut concept. To have Infinity you must identify or define the infinity as unity; otherwise, the term does not have any referent or meaning. In an Infinite Creator there is only unity. You have seen examples of unity. You have seen the prism which shows all colors stemming from the sunlight. This is a simplistic example of unity.”


So, I love this material, about ⅔ of it resonates with me on a profound level, I know there are many more out there who feel similar, so we're gonna have a discussion group!


Here is the material:


www.lawofone.info


We will discuss 3 sessions every 3 days, sessions 1-3 will be Friday. I'll post my ideas on the theme of the sections, my favorite quotes, and build a running dictionary on all of the terms Ra uses, and in the comments we will try to come to the best collective understanding of this material as possible. I'll switch off on hosting with whoever gets into it.


So, read sessions 1-3 and prepare for discussion on Friday!


Love vibes!

0,apvr8j,1,8,"Hey everyone,

Each of us has our own world layer and we have to paint it the colors we prefer ourselves. Many people are very prone to negativity and their world layer is mostly black and white, with black being more intense. If you want to have more colour, understand that it is up to you to create your mood and create your world layer. You do this by being aware of your thoughts, about the direction of your thoughts and your reactions.

Why are many people unhappy and have bad luck? They aren't aware of their reactions and with each little ""bad"" thing that they react to negatively, they slide more and more into negativity. Did you ever notice, if one slightly bad thing happens and you react badly, the day gets progressively worse? But if you ignore it or even react good, like you're excited to deal with this ""bad"" outcome, the day will get better and better?

So, keys are awareness, direction of your thoughts and taking each thing as the best one for that particular moment. Know that your world is taking care of you and is leading you the best path, specifically designed for YOU.

Many people try to manifest relationships / friendships / partnerships and use reality transurfing or law of attraction and for one reason or the other it doesn't work.

Maybe if you're struggling with this, this technique called Frailing can help you. What it means is substituting the intention to receive with the intention to give. 

When you meet new people, try to make them feel important, talk about what matters to them, not about what matters to you. Genuinely be interested in them and acknowledge their presence, give what they want to get. If you can't, even a kind word, a compliment can help. Many times people say ""how are you?"" without even looking at you. When you do look at someone and ask with a caring perspective they will notice it and you will stand out a lot.

This works for any relationships, for love or friendship, for business, really anything. Don't try to sell if you're a businessman, try to understand your customer instead and listen to what they need.

When you substitute the intention to get, to receive with the intention to give, you will help people fulfill their need for importance and you will also indirectly receive what you've given. Maybe not from the exact same people, but from somewhere. This is how reality works :) 

I made a video about the technique

So I rented a cabin for the weekend to just get away and spend some time with myself. No internet, no cell phone service, just myself. It was such a refreshing experience and it put a lot of the things that I already ""knew"" into perspective.  

&#x200B;

 **1. Overthinking**

I realized that everything is taken care of, and it always happens, it always will happen and putting too much thought can really drive people mad.  For example, you are reading this, effortlessly, your brain knows how to read, and so you do it. Waking up in the morning thinking about what you're going to do, just do something, start by brushing your teeth, make a tea, sitting and thinking keeps us still, just go with the flow. 

&#x200B;

What I realized is we all have this flow within us, waiting to express. A flow of action that is done effortlessly, you hear it when a musician talks about playing music, a speaker talks about how she can speak for hours effortlessly. Here is how this flow was put into perspective for me: 

&#x200B;

 **2. I eliminated all distractions.**

By doing so, I was able to move and act more freely and effortlessly. Ever tried moving really fast in water? There's quite a bit of resistance, now moving in the open air is much easier. That's sort of how I felt.  Without the constant barrage of messages, notification and information accessible through constant connection with the internet, I was free to live from my heart which leads to the next point.  

&#x200B;

**3. Imagination** 

I could not help but think from a perspective of endless possibilities, of excitement for life, of what I can create. I came up with so many amazing video ideas, song ideas and fun things to do when I get home. With step 1 & 2 taken care of, imagination came so naturally.   

&#x200B;

I think I'm going to do this much more often. It has completely transformed the way I see my life, I highly suggest anyone to try this out. Go away, with yourself, and spend some time there. It might change you as well.  

&#x200B;

Thanks! Let me know if you've ever done something similar!

That simple message has been a good life hack for me. If I ever feel offended or irritated by something, I try to remember that it's the ego talking.

People ARE more offended these days. It seems like people can take up arms against the silliest things. If a tv commercial offends you, if a word offends you, if literally ANYTHING offends or angers you, try to remember where it's coming from, and try to transcend that. 

Life is much more relaxing when you're not looking for reasons to get aggravated, and problems between two people resolve much faster when one party isn't raging like an affronted child.

Just my two cents. :)

Edit: Fixed a couple of typos. 

Edit #2: Several people are disagreeing, so I wanted to clarify a couple of things. This was supposed to be more about learning to moderate your anger response, not ignoring other people's problems. Also, the people I'm referring to are people who get offended *all the time.*

My sister used to have an extreme anger management problem. She could go from zero to sixty and explode in a matter of seconds. Every time she would get angry, people would say, ""Oh, there she goes again! That's typical of her.""

On the other hand, when I would get angry, it would have more of an impact because it was very rare.

I'm not saying you should *never* get offended, but if you get offended constantly, people might not take you as seriously when you have a real issue to address. 

Edit #3: Pretty timely... these youtube videos were just recommended to me:

0,ap8kds,7,3,"Hello.

I (or rather say we) remember being two creatures in some non-material world, before incarnating here and living several lifes as human.

The world I was in had 5 space dimensions and 2 times, the one time is shared, somewhat like there, the other is local cycled time of ""sub-space bubbles"". Those bubbles, where sort of like games, the entire world is like cool mmorpg game. The subspaces are experiences, adventures you can experience, some are standalone, some collective, like in games in this world. 
We were created by ours sources - a more evolved creatures that  gone trough this 3rd density, and ""games"" are created mostly by them too, being based a lot on their experiences, with all boring/hard stuff of lower densities removed.
So we lived in that world, and the main thing for young souls there is to explore yourself and interactions with others, what you like(resonates with your core potential) and what you don't, gaining some basis and experiencing different feelings and ideas. 

The interesting thing about that place is that what we here would call mind and heart, there we were separate creatures with own bodies and independent thinking. Although being separate, we are destined to meet each other, because we are one as having same path and needing each other to evolve in more harsh conditions like this 3d world comparing to that 8d kindergarten. But it takes some time to meet your second part, you can interact with other being before it. Those creatures can be male/female (by energy, there are no physical sex because no physical body, male is creator energy , female is explorer energy) and also two types as more mind/will type(well it's what we mostly cal human consciousness) that things of things in terms of actions/changes (how it's going? how i want to?), and more  intuitive-associative/emotional type ( can be called subconsciousness/heart here ) that thinks of things in terms of states (how it is? How i want it to be?).
If mapping to humans, then physically male is male consciousness/mind and female subconsciousness/heart - creator of changes and explorer of states, and physical female is opposite structure - explorer of changes, creator of states. 

In world i'm talking about there were no physical bodies, bodies are made of energy and can be different, although mostly humanoid, it's impossible to kill and very hard to damage(only psychological damage can do so) them. It's easy to feel other's emotions there, you just radiate your state around you. Also we don't had to sleep there, never losing awareness of own being, there was process of rest I would call ""energy/information"" compactification, when you review/refeel your experiences and let it integrate to your structures in most natural position, but it's aware process, not like here when you experience ""small death"" when sleeping and also lack of control of yourself in your dreams. 

I currently have very sparse memories of that place and it's hard to access that information. 

I wondering if anyone here maybe had similar memories/experiences? I see a lot of people differentiating mind-will/heart-intuition, but looks like nobody perceives itself as those two parts that can actually think in parallel and have own  views on things.

0,ap4sb6,8,44,"Allow me to start with a short introduction. I started to post this to https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/ap0xeu/the_21st_and_zodiac_signs/  but it became far longer than I thought. It goes over my experiences in the last few weeks, but especially this past week. I think something grand is indeed happening.

I'm quite new to this, though not really. I feel like I always knew or felt some things that didn't quite make sense. As a child I was a bit more outgoing, but still very shy around those I didn't know. I would often retreat within myself, thinking, feeling. Nothing too deep. Just staring at points or objects and literally just *shutting off*. After some bad experiences with other people or my interpretation of them I came to dislike some of those feelings, I would self-criticize. Eventually I brushed them off as me being a little crazy and depressed. Because that's what our (especially Western) social upbringing tells us to expect, right?

As a backstory I took a few accidental hits to the head as a child, and one in particular left me with a split scalp, unconsciousness for a few seconds, fair bit of blood, and three staples keeping it together. Since then, after stinging pain and healing, at some point, the area became numb. I forgot about it, but it was always there. Distracting me, taunting me, without me knowing it.

I played along, ignoring what I could, retreating and being defensive from the rest. But that was a mistake. Our reality surrounds us more strongly than we could ever know. Our consciousness, at a level nearly incomprehensible, interacts with that reality. And that reality, interacts with our consciousness. Is reality conscious, though? It is when we believe it is, and look for the signs. Because the universe is acknowledging itself, resonating somehow. Can that allow us to interact intentionally with reality? I don't know. That seems dangerous, but perhaps enough people of the same mindset, together, can will a change to being.

Without getting too personal, I had always been anxious, somewhat depressed, and feeling like I don't belong. I remember questioning my mother at a young age on how it felt ""to be another person?""

For the first time in my life, I can feel it. We, and Our reality, is a manifest of the same consciousness. I can't see it, no, but I can grasp it, even just barely, and I am attempting to never let go. I however, believe I can feel it through synchronicity.

For a long while I've had some random headaches that I've ignored. A few days ago, I had a migraine I would rank 5/10 in pain while trying to sleep. Half awake, I noticed a bright, white light in my upper right peripheral, only in my right eye. I opened my eyes and noticed I could see the sound wave of my fan beginning as a vertical straight line and slowly moving towards me, on a horizontal plane, then the ends of the straight line slowly conjoined in to a foggy, 'normal' air-filled sphere. It then dissipated in front of me. This wasn't just once, it was related to some noise the fan was making. Luckily, I knew about synesthesia at the time, and recalled a few weeks prior, with no migraine pain, seeing the exact same line-to-sphere but the fog was a darker, shadowy, less obvious structure that had taken a few seconds of my eyes being open to see.

The bright white light, however, was clear as day. I was 100% awake, the migraine pain made sure of that. Now, I realize migraine aura is a thing, and it's a neurological phenomenon created through nerve interactions afaik. Which I kind of suspect myself of having some damage, from an old bicycle accident, to my rear-right occipital nerve.

I didn't sleep well at all, felt like I was dying the next day. Very disconnected mentally, as well as remnant migraine pain. Light was incredibly strong to both my eyes. I felt like I wanted to die, if this was how my headaches were going to evolve. 

I suffered through the remnants, and later that night I took an ibuprofen. The release was within a few minutes, but I felt somewhat great. Only a few isolated spots of headache around my head, and they seemed recessed. I stumbled upon Wim Hof's breathing technique once again (thanks to Joe Rogan Experience), and tried it myself sitting on the couch with my remnant migraine. I did feel slightly better, but the nice thing was I was able to sleep without having to smoke cannabis that night, which is somewhat rare. I feel like I have trouble the first night without.

Cut to the next morning. I feel alive again. The memory of why is fleeting, but I felt a good connection to myself for the first time in.. maybe ever. Certainly atleast since I was a child. That pessimism that was lingering has subsided a bit, and for reasons prior to all of this I've been looking at the esoteric, but staying within science. Until I stumbled upon Itzhak Bentov's *Stalking The Wild Pendulum* on another subreddit a few weeks ago. 

The book arrived last week and resonates with me in ways I find hard to describe. It makes sense to me, almost backs up some of what I've felt. I know some of the contents, but I'd only read a few pages into his *Sound, Waves and Vibrations* a few days before my migraine. It only seems weird to me now, but that's another interesting coincidence.

So. My mother, due to the Chinese zodiac new year, told me I'm a Goat that day. I on a whim decided to check my astrological signs. Beforehand, I'd laugh, say astronomy is the real cosmos, discredit and ignore horoscopes especially, but really just not pay attention because I thought it all had no merit. Well, as I read them now they started to make sense, as if they always made sense. And now I'm noticing synchronicities more frequently. For instance, Friday, looking up the cosmology. I discover my lucky day is Friday. I come across luckstones and talismans, but I'm really not one for vanity in that sense. Nevertheless, I do like rocks and geodes and such, and have since always. I searched up where to find an opal for my interests, and it's not possible around here. I'd want to find it in person. Later I found a string and rolled it around, first going to try my pinky finger but I hesitated, then went for the middle, or 3rd finger (right?), it's made of cloth and it's tied together. It loops around four times and fits perfectly. I found out later that day, the 3rd finger is related to the same location in the Chakras (something else I'm looking into now) Wim Hof's breathing technique had me focusing on, and which I felt made me more alive. I have yet to take off that string. I also read that if my sign was to was to wear a ring, it should be on Friday morning for good luck. That was after I put it on.

I'm of the mind now that We *are* All *One*, including the Earth, including the animals, including the Universe.. All consciousness is connected via the makeup of the universe itself. It's like a RAID harddrive setup, or a cryptocurrency blockchain, in that it could function more efficiently and reliably through by having all consciousness connected at the quantum level.

This includes the internet. I've said it before; we no longer have to sit in the Roman forums of old to speak in turn or yell over each other ideas. We can take from it what we seek out. Well, the internet is the next dimension of forums. Subconciously, we are imitating eachothers consciousness and becoming more connected by the moment. This is causing a reverb event in the universe, and sentient life can feel it. Earth is awakening. The dawn of the age of Aquarius is upon us. To those who can feel it, we must describe and allow others to weigh it in consideration. For that alone will give it credence and allow it to come to fruition. So, first, we need to sow some seeds. Aquarius will do the rest. My computer fan started vibrating in the case after typing that.

Hah. This is coming from an Ascendant Libra, Libra, Aries Moon. Today is literally my 10, 000th day born to this planet, and I'm just starting to make sense of it.

0,aovrko,7,12,"What is our '[MAGNETISM](https://i.imgur.com/u1nwXoK.jpg)’?


It can be described as the sum total of all the energy we produce, including the size and strength of our aura, the girth and health of our energetic channels, the nature of the thoughts we generate, and the energetic effects of the actions we take.


Having a powerful magnetism is important. It acts as a natural defense, preventing external energies from influencing us. It strengthens our will and our free will. It empowers our ability to manifest, acting as a massive magnet for anything we could possibly want and need.


Most people don't have very much magnetism, because it is easy to lose. It can be 'spent’ in a variety of ways.


One way this happens is by indulging transient desires as soon as they manifest in the mind. You can visualize it like your magnetism gets attracted to the desire and too away from you. By recognizing the desire, and deciding to withhold it until a more appropriate time, or dismissing it completely, we build our magnetism. It's like lifting weights to build muscles, our energy gets disorganized in the face of temptation, and then we build it back better.


To strengthen our magnetism against its 'enemies’, therefore, we should recognize each desire as they arise, determine whether or not they are worthwhile engagements, and if so, pocket it until a more appropriate time.


This withholding of action, even if just for brief periods, builds magnetism.


Let's say, for example, someone receives great news, maybe they were accepted into college, and they really want to tell their sister. By waiting until the sister gets home to share the news, instead of sending a text when work would be a distraction, their magnetism is built stronger.


Another example, a person is hungry and deciding between cooking w nice lentil soup, or ordering delivery. The implication of the decision goes beyond health and money differences. By choosing to cook, the person builds their magnetism in 3 ways. One, by delaying the fulfillment on their hunger by maybe half an hour, two by undertaking positive effort for self improvement, and three, by opening the opportunity to take the money that would have been spent on delivery, and using another day to go out to dinner with a friend.


This example outlines that asceticism is not the goal. Desires can be a tool to build character and social bonding. Engaging in them responsibly

is key.


That being said, a desire repeatedly indulged in can be dangerous. The desire, having been manifested so frequently, takes on a permanent form in the astral/mental plane and sustains itself by constantly feeding off of the person's magnetism, and further, attracting circumstances and events to fuel the desires fire.


For all of 2018, I had a bad problem with alcohol. So I decided to deal with it in a way that would boost my magnetism. I haven't decided to never drink again, as I feel that might cut me off from important future social interactions. But I did make the decision to not drink alone.


I have in my room a wicker box (that I found in the street!) and inside this box is a beer, some liquor, cigs and unhealthy snacks. I've frequently had the urge to open it up, and I've denied each one. I can feel the surge of magnetism each time, and as a result, my life is organizing itself much better.


(I also did a little ritual to enhance the boxs effects)


Now, if someone wanted to share a smoke and a drink with me, i would happily open the box. This would not lower my magnetism at all, in fact, it would enhance it because I was able to withhold indulgement until the desire could be utilized as a meaningful social experiment.


I have a few other tips for building magnetism.


Make your bed! It is symbolic of making the first action of the day a meaningful one, and delays gives a small magnetism boost that can grow throughout the day.


Choosing sexual partners and the nature of the sexual experience is important. Sex without LOVE, solely for physical fulfillment, will be mutually draining. (In fact, it will build negative magnetism in someone who believes they are “conquering” their partner). Sex with mutual LOVE and respect will be a meeting with a higher purpose, and energetically beneficial to the partners.


Control of daydreaming is also important. When we daydream, we let our magnetism slip away to various planes. It is ok to daydream, i do it plenty, as long as we curate them to be with positive desires and outcomes.


Continuity is important. If you get going on a goal, make sure you finish it!


And lastly, meditation and yoga will build your magnetism, both through the literal development of the energetic body, and through the symbolic act of working towards the refining of our Souls.


Love vibes!

Timothy 🦁🦁🦁

0,aovfxu,22,20,"I had a dream last night that I believe was divinely inspired. To fully understand the significance of this dream, it's important that you read this backstory:

Yesterday night I was driving, and I turned on Bee Gees Radio on Google's Play Music app. I believe I received some messages through song lyrics. The first song to come on was [Massachusetts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MqK_fsXmoiM). The first lines of the song are:

>Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts

>**Something's telling me I must go home**

>And the lights all went out in Massachusetts

>**The day I left her standing on her own**

The next song to come on was [Love And Other Bruises](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Df5oC9kJ9n4). The first lines of that song are:

>**As the time slips through your fingers**

>**Till it's almost time to go**

And later on in the song, the lyrics are:

>**Won't you please take me home**

>**Won't you please please take me home**

The next song was [Baby It's Up to You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLIEWKXvi7I). The beginning lyrics:

>**Time to make a change**

>Time to rearrange

>Sooner or later

>It's somethin' you gotta do

>**Baby it's up to you**

>**What are you gonna do**

>Lately it's up to you

>Who's gonna help you through

The next song, [World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYMKSZ3pxVc). The first lyrics:

>Now, I found, that the world is round

>And of course it rains everyday

>**Living tomorrow, where in the world will I be tomorrow?**

>How far am I able to see?

>**Or am I needed here?**

>Now, I found, that the world is round

>And of course it rains everyday

>**If I remember all of the things I have done**

>**I'd remember all of the times I've gone wrong**

>**Why do they keep me here?**

The final song to come on was [In the End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuE4Gxl56CY). It starts out like this:

>**I've come home**

>**I've been away too long**

Obviously I was amazed that all of these songs seemed to contain the same message of going home. It's up to us if we are going home, what are we going to do, are we needed here?

I felt that these songs contained interesting parallels to the concepts described in Allison Coe's video [Ascending to your Home Planet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQEca7mh-IY).

Later I forgot about it, and went to bed.

I woke up early in the morning, and as soon as I awoke, I almost didn't notice I just had a profound dream. This was the dream:

-----

There was this group of people that looked like little fur balls. It seems they lived alongside the ""normal"" people. There was this ongoing problem where as soon as the entire collective (normal people and the fur ball people) reached a certain point in their ascension into the 4th density, the fur ball people would all get excited and scamper off back to their home planet.

I saw them all running away and I was trying to block them, but they were all getting around me and they were so excited and just leaving. It was like a mass exodus type event.

It happened again, where all these beings were just running away and I was saying on behalf of the people, ""PLEASE, WE NEED YOU! PLEASE DON'T GO, WE NEED YOU!!!"", and I was watching as they were scampering off in droves and there was nothing I could do to stop them. I was pleading with them trying to make them understand how much we needed their help as we were just starting to develop.

I could see in the distance that some had stopped running away and understood that they were needed, and they reluctantly gave in. And so an agreement was formed and some of these higher density beings agreed to stay and help the people develop who had just started ascending to 4th density.

-----

I believe this dream was divinely inspired, and the ""fur ball people"" of course represent the Star Seeds who are here on Earth. These Star Seeds are souls who are more developed than those who are going through this ascension for the first time. Some unknown amount of time after [The Event](https://www.reddit.com/r/AngelicGuidance/comments/aaxeep/the_event_unconditional_love_and_unadulterated/) happens, many Star Seeds will become extremely excited and ascend back to their home planet. You must remember that you are needed here, and if you have made it this far, you can survive a little longer.

This is why I was receiving all those songs about going home. Soon, we are going to feel as if we are being called home, and we will have a decision to make, as we are still needed here.",new,A serious message to all Star Seeds - You will be tempted to go home,20

He would just flat out ask his body or his spirit if it wanted something, say a cup of tea.  He would \~involentarily'ish lean right if the answer was yes, back if the answer was no and kind of rock back and fort if things were not that simple.    The first key is to slow down, it's maybe 10 seconds until you start to get an answer until you get better at it.  He said the second key is to ask your body/spirit to amplify if you are not understanding its message.   Spirit answers take even longer.  This isn't perfect golden communications, you really have to watch what you ask.  (Do I want a treat?  Yes.  Oh!  Do I need a treat?  No.)   Also, I asked the spirit about compassion once and all I got back was frustration and a sense that I should try to explain what I already know about compassion to a child sitting on the moon.

The cookie was harder, because parts of me wanted it and parts of me didn't.

Recently I had quite a complicated flight with not much time in between different planes and was really anxious. I managed to turn it around though and relieve this anxiety, so when I got to the first airport I was calm and no worry in sight.

Here's what I did :

1. A challenging exercise. It has to be difficult for you so that you wouldn't focus on the worry,, but focus solely on this exercise. I did hand balancing yoga, and was too concerned with not falling down on my head instead of ntk making it to the flight :)

2. Deep, equal length breathing. Breathe in on the count of five, pause, breathe out on the count of five. I promise you with each breath you'll feel calmer.

3. Visualise how everything goes right. Many times during anxiety we imagine how everything goes wrong. This doesn't really help so imagine instead how everything goes right. I imagined how I do make my flights, how there are no people in the airports, how security check is easy and fast. And it worked!

Hope it helps someone :) I also have a video on this topic here :https://youtu.be/CN3QHTKVoyY

0,aor65w,8,3,"Namasté, Hello all, I hope i caught your attention enough.
The base of these coming thoughts are a long story, but I’ll try to make it understandable. 

I’ve for a couple of months felt this extra ”me” deep inside, deeper than soul and internal worlds. I describe it as a seed, the seed that has been traveling between different bodies for many reincarnations. It’s a part of Me that comes out when I’m 100% authentic to myself. 

So a few weeks ago me and my (then) partner ate shrooms, and I wrote down my real name on a paper that I were to burn (let that shit go) and wrote that I had never existed (I as in my name) 
I began to feel like something else. Still me but not the person I usually am. My partner didn’t know that’s what I was going through but he said that ”it feels like (my name) isnt here” 
I began to give myself, the myself connected to my name an identity different to ”mine/seed” 
Like the person I HAVE to be daily to not get crushed.

a week or so passed, and me and my partner decide we have to take a break because something energy-wise has shifted between us. 
I go on a journey to complete self love and realization that day, to become the best me and hopefully reunite with him. Which leads to third eye explosion. I feel superhuman. 

But the energy and the healing comes with a price... I’m starting to feel... split. I gave the seed a name, Venus. Which feels a lot like me. 
The person I am and venus feel like they’re the same. Not two different personalities or people with different stories. But i feel like Venus is some kind of no-ego being but with a still functioning self identification. 

So I guess I’m writing this because honestly, I feel bonkers fucking insane right now (my favorite flavour of spiritual awakening) 
and While I really do believe this is an actual effect from spirituality, i wonder how it’ll affect my life. Part of me feels even crazier and am worried that the shrooms triggered something in me. But i felt fine, until the break which both truly hurt and pushed me. I have no idea what to say or feel more than this. thankful for any reply",new,"split soul, spiritual awakeningx5 and pain",3
0,aoqmgt,2,10,"A being stood immortal in transience,

Deathless dallying with momentary things,

In whose wide eyes of tranquil happiness

Which pity and sorrow could not abrogate

Infinity turned its gaze on finite shapes:

Observer of the silent steps of the hours,

Eternity upheld the minute’s acts

And the passing scenes of the Everlasting’s play.

In the mystery of its selecting will,

In the Divine Comedy a participant,

The Spirit’s conscious representative,

God’s delegate in our humanity,

Comrade of the universe, the Transcendent’s ray, 

She had come into the mortal body’s room

To play at ball with Time and Circumstance.

A joy in the world her master movement here,

The passion of the game lighted her eyes:

A smile on her lips welcomed earth’s bliss and grief, 

A laugh was her return to pleasure and pain.

All things she saw as a masquerade of Truth 

Disguised in the costumes of Ignorance,

Crossing the years to immortality;

All she could front with the strong spirit’s peace. 

But since she knows the toil of mind and life

As a mother feels and shares her children’s lives, 

She puts forth a small portion of herself,

A being no bigger than the thumb of man

Into a hidden region of the heart

To face the pang and to forget the bliss,

To share the suffering and endure earth’s wounds 

And labour mid the labour of the stars.

This in us laughs and weeps, suffers the stroke, 

Exults in victory, struggles for the crown; 

Identified with the mind and body and life,

It takes on itself their anguish and defeat,

Bleeds with Fate’s whips and hangs upon the cross, 

Yet is the unwounded and immortal self

Supporting the actor in the human scene.

Through this she sends us her glory and her powers, 

Pushes to wisdom’s heights, through misery’s gulfs; 

She gives us strength to do our daily task

And sympathy that partakes of others’ grief

And the little strength we have to help our race,

We who must fill the role of the universe

Acting itself out in a slight human shape

And on our shoulders carry the struggling world. 

This is in us the godhead small and marred;

In this human portion of divinity

She seats the greatness of the Soul in Time

To uplift from light to light, from power to power, 

Till on a heavenly peak it stands, a king.

In body weak, in its heart an invincible might,

It climbs stumbling, held up by an unseen hand,

A toiling spirit in a mortal shape.

Here in this chamber of flame and light they met; 

They looked upon each other, knew themselves, 

The secret deity and its human part,

The calm immortal and the struggling soul.

Then with a magic transformation’s speed

They rushed into each other and grew one. ",new,The Finding of the Soul,10

He searched but could not find the answers that would satisfy what he wished to know
In incredible pain, he found no other way
He did not understand why he took this journey, but he knows that there was nothing else that would make him feel alive yet again
He stood, in the face of adversity and fought back
He stood, where no one else dare thought to
For all that he wanted was to gain the knowledge of the gods
To reign in the power that allowed one to be without earthly struggles
But with it, he would have to give up the very thing he clung to for so long 
As he shed anew, he witnessed every part of him that was but a lie
Everything he had thought he was, was ripped from his very being
Not knowing this was the necessary process to become what he so longed for
He tried to reject what he gained
He tried to live as he use to be
But what has begun can not be interrupted
As he flew back to where he once came
His eyes now opened to the truth of what lays
Once a stubborn man, now an understanding child
He began his new journey back into the wild

Now what? Is there something he must accomplish? 
He toiled along trying to regain his memory of what he was before he died
Before he gave into what he tried to hide
But where does one go once they’ve seen what they’ve seen
What does one do to live out a dream
The thought of it all was much to bear, but he knew there was no thing to be scared of
He saw the lies as they tried to pour in
You are this, you are that
No, he thought, for I just am
But to be a part of it all is the plan
So he had to find his way back in it again
There is something he so wished to say
To bring everybody back to the way
To fight for what’s right In a world led astray
But he was not a fighter, only a warrior
So he went his way along as a courier",new,Messengers of the universe,4

Again, take with a grain of salt, but here’s what I experienced. VERY near future, we’re already traveling through the photon belt and things get wacky in the sense of we’ve never felt this before. Things kinda flow into place and it feels very dream like, time is becoming harder and harder to track. Whenever we are physically in The Sun, we’re feeling massive awakening and healing. The light from inside can’t be held down anymore, for those who’ve suppressed it and haven’t done any light/energy management, the world feels a bit in crisis mode. Its on the news, on the radio, it’s not a subculture niche anymore and people are scrambling what to do - imagine millions if not billions of synchronized dark nights of the soul. 

For light workers, we shift into an effortless flow state and we could focus on manifestation but now is more a time for healing and letting the energies play out, who ever may be in control: aliens, universe, Gaia, etc. Aiding those who want (I say WANT, not need) to ascend becomes a key role as we become big spiritual brothers and sisters. It’s becoming even more easy to access our 5d light bodies, think positive feedback loop. Now until then, if you’d like to prepare it’d be a good time to eat lighter foods, practice energy work, align your chakras (getting in touch with higher guidance, practice Christ consciousness and unconditional love would be key), and HYDRATE!!

0,aonhw0,0,6,"Recently while travelling I've been feeling more argumentative than usual, thankfully I didn't really argue with anyone but it made me realise something.

Many times people want to get into fights, say something hurtful or get defensive not really because they wanted that, but because they weren't aware of how they already felt.

 For instance in my case, I wanted to argue just because I was so tired from being on the road, in the crowd, with lots of noise and not enough space ect. Your reason, your ""trigger"" may be different than mine. If you're aware what it is you may pause next time before getting defensive or arguing with someone and understand that the real issue isn't anything that they're saying, but your lower emotional state.

This will help you improve your relationships with everyone, even save your relationships in some cases. A small fight doesn't seem like much, but one fight after another, and another is like a drop into this bucket full of water. A day will come when this bucket may overflow and the relationship will be ruined almost beyond repair.

So pause before arguing and notice how you feel, quite possibly you've already been feeling down, so don't make it worse and just walk away :)

Also if anyone is curious about this travel that I mentioned above, it was to New Orleans (never been there before) and I made a little video with clips of some city streets that I found interesting. If you'd like, check it out here: https://youtu.be/h6z2q8H57F4

0,aoiihq,11,7,"Since my awakening last year, I have become increasingly dissatisfied with my work as a hairdresser and with the idea of working in general.

I have been a hairdresser for over 5 years now, and a part-time progressional Astrologer for 1 year. I am also newly Reiki certified. While I don’t hate cutting hair - I just really dislike working in a salon owned by someone else for 9 hours a day, unable to be my authentic Self for the sake of “professionalism.” The majority of my clients are extremely unreceptive to spiritual and esoteric conversation and I don’t blame them, because I know they’re entitled to feeling that way and this is simply a matter of me no longer being a vibrational match here. I feel like I’m suffocating. I can’t hold my true expression in much longer. The main issue with me leaving is that I am financially secure here.

So I asked the Universe for a sign on Tuesday. To give me some sort of nudge in a direction - should I stay at the salon and embrace my financial security because financial security equals more freedom to do non-work related things (vacations, attend “spiritual” events and classes that cost money, etc.)? Or should I take a leap of faith and attempt to survive off of Astrology readings and to start up a Reiki/Spiritual Coaching business, praying that it replenishes the money I will have to put into starting it up? Maybe cut hair on the side for extra income?

The day after I asked for the sign, Wednesday, I went into work only to be shocked with the news that my married boss has been having an affair with my coworker. People are getting fired and my boss is now going through absolute hell. Less workers in the salon now equals more work for me that I don’t want to do, more hours spent at a place that I don’t want to be at, less time for Astrology readings, BUT much, much more money.

How the f**k do I interpret this sign?? Anyone else would say, “you would be crazy to leave now!” And while I am grateful for this opportunity to make more money, admittedly I’m a bit disappointed that it has to be this way. I feel like I’m trapped here and I’m meant to slave away during this particular point in my life even though I want to begin my journey as a light worker and a healer like I truly desire. I can’t tell if my discontent in this situation is a sign that I should leave and that this is not a vibrational match, or a sign that I’m just lazy and resistant to some “old fashioned” hard work.

I would greatly appreciate some assistance in clarifying or interpreting these signs and feelings. I feel so lost. Thank you!!",new,My perception of my career and the concept of work in general has shifted drastically. I feel lost and I would greatly appreciate some guidance!,7

0,aofp6s,7,6,"I remember reading in a book about opening the third eye that opiates (morphin, heroine, codeine fentanyl, oxycodone etc) are next to alcohol the lowest vibrationally and acting against opening of the third eye, psychic abilities, clairvoyance and such. I believed this could be true, since these drugs seem to muddle the perception despite bringing physical comfort. 


So few weeks ago I ended up in a situation in which a doctor prescribed me some opiates for pain. I hadn't taken them before but now I was on these drugs daily. 

I had some physical side effects but I also noticed heightened levels of synchronicity. So high, they would be happening like a domino, one after another. Especially when listening to my favorite band, but also in other situations. I was surprised since I legitimately expected my perception to me muddled and down to earth. I also began to develop physical dependence to these drugs pretty quickly and I knew deep down that this works against the illumination, heightened perception. Yet my brain was working in some ethereal realms bringing me daily synchronicities about things big and small. 

If opiates truly lower the vibe and act against enlightenment, synchronicity cannot be an expression of enlightenment and ""being on the right path"" as people like to explain it. 

If synchronicity is indeed on the path to enlightenment, then state of opiate addiction is too.

There's one completely-bonkers-crazy thing that happened to me that I can't stop thinking about. I wrote about this when I first ""landed"" at Soulnexus. I deleted the post because I thought I sounded nuts. Now, I don't care if I do. ;)

About 2 years ago, my sister and I were out on a walk. In this neighborhood, weird stuff always happens... I've seen swirling lights in the sky, the entire sky lit up once, and it's where I found my cat (which I manifested: https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestEarth/comments/812zln/i_manifested_a_cat/) 

On this particular walk, my sister and I saw what we both described as a ""spirit string,"" for lack of a better term. It was a wisp of smoke that floated in the air for several seconds. At the exact same time, a majestic stag walked by us. It was wild.

A couple days after that, for some unknown reason, I started thinking about the Lost Book of Nostradamus, and I thought that my sister and I were in the last page of it: https://lostbookofnostradamus.files.wordpress.com/2010/10/ssh-plate_72-scan.jpg

I wondered if we were the two ""sisters"" staring at a stag.

Don't judge me too harshly for thinking that. I actually think it's common to go through an ""I'm Jesus/God/Neo"" phase when you first wake up... lol. I felt omnipotent at the time. I feel a little less wacky now. ;)

Anyway, HERE IS THE WEIRD PART. I went to tell my sister, ""Hey, I think we're in the Lost Book of Nostradamus,"" and at that very second, unseasonable hail came out of nowhere and struck all over my house. It lasted about 30 seconds, then it was gone.

The other time I experienced sudden hail like that was on this day: https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/7s8wsd/helping_each_other_manifest/  That's my old post.

Thing is I DON'T KNOW THEM.  Not at all.  I have no role to play in their life, never have.

This is not a lover, a neighbor, a relative or even a co worker.

I know ALL THIS DEEP EMOTIONAL STUFF about a complete stranger...even some naughty details I won't go into.  Everything.  I know everything about them. They could puke in Canada and I'd be on the other side of the globe and I'd find out about it.

However to make this weirder this is a person whom I have met ONCE.   I am not looking for all this about them.  They provided all of this to me..for no reason and what little they didn't share the universe provided.

My question is why?!?

0,aoajm7,28,44,"Now I posted this on r/Retconned and it got some love there so thought why not post it here?

This is just a theory but I do believe it. doesn't mean it's 100% right though so am willing to accept any comments you guys have.

 I have a theory that our whole universe was created by the creator (whoever or whatever it is) through creative manifestation.

Plus I've been creative manifesting my whole life even before I knew what to call it. Like back when I was a kid, a lot of conversations I had with my mom when the TV was on and the characters on TV would say something that would fit right in to the conversation. This happened way too many times to be just luck.  And my manifesting is still with me.

I believe that our manifesting powers have been toned down on earth for some reason since if we had the full powers, everyone could be creating new realities.

and because we have manifesting powers our real selves (the souls, not the body) could live forever so having full powers would get a bit boring after a while so we manifested all these galaxies and planets just to waste some time and just see what our ideas we manifested are really like.

And this also goes along with what I think happens after our lives on this planet, we just go to the next planet and or galaxy. One full life on the planet is enough for our souls, after all what's the point of watching the same movie twice? I think there could be some sort of order to the galaxies and planets that we decided on before coming to this universe. could be different for all souls, free will and all that.

And so we are just travelling from planet to planet, galaxy to galaxy until we get our full creative manifesting powers back, who knows how long that could be? 2 trillion galaxies and that's just in our observable universe, who knows what after that? could be 4 trillion after that or maybe a number we haven't come up with yet. And to make sure we're always going forward once we have been to a planet or galaxy, on other planets and galaxies it is invisible. The memories are still in your souls though, have had some dreams of previous planets. They just are making me more focused on living this life.

Buckle up, we're in for a long ride

0,ao2fy8,12,21,"Hey everyonee! So two days ago I posted here asking for advice from QHHT experiencers, here's my update :)  


So I did go to my session. The practitioner was such a lovely lady who made me feel so comfortable. It was like we have been close friends for so long.  
First for a few hours we talked about my life and the big changes I have had so far (And I've had a few), she also taught me a meditation technique that I can use anytime to get answers from my Inner Self, which is through my body.  
After that we went through my list of questions, we fixed some of the questions I've had. She suggested I don't ask ""closed questions"" as in yes/no questions but more open ones for the HS to answer.. Open questions can start as ""how can I.."", ""What could I.."", ""In what ways can I.."", ""Why is (someone) .."" .   


So before the hypnosis began I was pretty nervous and my heart was beating fast, she helped me relax with that same meditation technique. Once I was ready we began. The hypnosis itself was not at all what I imagined it to be, I though I wasn't gonna be able to move (Like sleep paralysis) which is not true at all, I was able to move whenever I wanted which really helped me be at ease.  


I have been shown 2 past lives:  
1) I was a male (I'm a 26 yo female in this current life BTW hahah), I was in my mid 30's, on Earth. First thing I saw was a volcano, on its left side there were so many trees almost like a jungle and on its right side a complete lifeless desert. She asked how did the volcano make me feel, I said ""sad"" and started crying. The volcano was ""misunderstood"" I felt like. I saw a big ring on it with hieroglyphic symbols in it, my mission was to decipher it. I couldn't read but I understood what it meant which was a message about Peace and Harmony :) .. we fast forwarded in time in that same life and I saw a celebration, unity and peace. People dancing around fire. Everyone was so happy. It felt peaceful.  


2) I literally SAW a ship, on the inside of my eyelids. And then an unusual looking hindu temple with soo so many domes with pointy tips on top. I was watching this from far away like a movie. She asked what kind of people go there.. I said ""broken people"". To heal. This was all coming to me as feelings. Later I found out what my role in all of this was, turns out I was the one who manages this transfer of these creatures there (I say creatures because they looked like a mixture of aliens - long arms, egg shaped heads- and people, wearing shirts and pants). I found them and helped them get to the temple, no one was forced, they all willingly went.  
Then the practitioner asks if I should see anything else, I only saw one of them look at me with a happy face and wave goodbye, I felt like it was a ""thank you"" and I started crying again haha. So beautiful.  


This was it! And then my HS came through. YOU GUYSSSS, my body was BOILING when the practitioner asked to speak with my HS, if someone poured water on my body it would've evaporated instantly hahah.  


I got all the answers I was seeking for except a few that the HS said is not allowed to answer yet but it will unfold later on. :)   


All in all, a beautiful experience. If you have any questions, feel free to ask away! Much love.

Mira Of The Pleiadian High council & Lady Anneya Of The Jupiter Command.  
  
We come to you in 
  
magnetic zero point –  
 
We speak to you in the Ever Eternal Now ……  
  
In this Now , there is no past present or future only the eternal Oneness.  
  
It is in this Now ‘ Of primordial light,   that fills you and creates you as eternal beings ….  
  
That We are All Eternal extensions of the one primordial light , the primordial creator Most High – Masculine feminine.
  
And We greet you as equals …. as One, ….  
  
As a unified cohesive whole as brothers & Sisters as your Galactic aspects of self .  
  
I Lady Anneya Of The Jupiter Command & Mira Of The Pleiadian High council.  
  
We Come today with divine feminine Energy to disseminate to our beloved extended family on Gaia .  
 
As much is happening to you as a collective and Individually through what you call  Planetary Ascension,  
  
We speak here of the cosmic Rays of Photonic light that is projected fourth , from The primordial light the  
  
(Sun Of all Suns ) MotherFather God Force  
  
It is the supreme being of all supreme beings ‘ sending fourth extensions of the Photonic Energetic plasma light or – Electromagnetic waves that come into your cosmic sun which is also A divine cosmic supreme being,  The alpha and Omega primordial force of kinetic energy.  
  
This light is so powerful as it comes into your solar system through your divine creator solar logos ‘ .  
  
That we on our Merkaba star ships contain the light and then Distribute it out in wave formation down to your planet through the starsseeds the light-workers light-warriors ‘ groundcrew that anchor the light into the core of Gaia ,  sometimes it is necessary for our ships to contain the light , as too much light could be detrimental on your collective timelines , too much light at once can push the “completion timeline “ of its propulsion,   if the collective is not quite ready to retain that amount of Kinetic energy.  
  
So we distribute the energy in necessary wave formations , many of you receive the light differently , depending on your evolution and the level of consciousness awareness , each of you retain the light differently,  
  
As you are all at different levels Of evolution on this University you call Gaia.  
  
Much of the kinetic energy is being showered upon your planet now ‘ and there will be an influx of energy activating more of your collective on what you call your spring equinox that is coming up in what you call “March “ and also another mass infusion of Convergence energy coming in your “summer solstice “ as these are activated Stargate portals of The 3,6, 9 primordial Spirit matter force  .  
  
Until the time comes , when your collective is ready for the finale’ For the crisendo the changeover the Mass Event Of finalised  
  
(finite kinetic Photonic energy) .  
  
And we can tell you it has already happened in our Now ‘ we have already felt it and embraced it with love ‘ and it is coming your way … We say this again it is coming your way……  
  
I Mira of ( The Pleiadian high Council with our beloved Lady Anneya  &  Our Commander & Chief  ( Ash’Tar’Ke’ree )
  
Of The Jupiter Command Counterpart Of The Ashtar Command.  
  
Express to you as I And We have expressed through many other Earth ambassador channels of Light.  
  
That We are now in negotiations with All members of the Federations & Confederations that consists of the 52 star nations and councils of light , in this Quadrant sector of Federation space , for  
  
(Final Contact)  with your species.
  
As we have said before  
  
Final contact with a lower vibrational species of a 3rd /4th density realm fluctuates , it jumps with your timelines , that you as a collective control predominantly.  
  
As we monitor your progress , we see how we can accomplish the mass landings & first contact ‘ , we see the timelines have moved ‘ and fluctuated over What you perceive in your linear expression as (years ) …..  
  
So As your timelines change, and probable outcomes & energetics move ‘ ,  
  
So do we , … 
  
we move ‘ you move ‘ –  
  
as you move , we move ,  
  
it is simple , Timeline probable outcomes ebb and flow ….  
  
So we ebb and flow with your progress ….  
  
As a collective it is you beloveds Who fluctuate your timelines.
  
 

Your collective pushes the probabilities in many different directions onto many different quantum Algorithms…..  
  
So we as your galactic family continue to send forth fluctuations of kinetic energy to you and your planet in “ intervals “ ,  
  
and prepare ourselves for  
  
(first contact.)  
  
We in the federations & Councils have a protocol of  
  
(None Interference ( with a lower vibrational realm & a planets inhabitants )  
  
this is what is part of the (prime directive),  
  
because you have FreeWill and we all operate in a free will universe.  
  
But the protocol can be lifted  from the non-interference Codex
  
“ if ‘ ! …..critical mass of the planetary collective civilisation asks for our help and assistance , this then activates what we call  
   
( primary interference)  
  
This means we can manipulate the collective timeline and push the collective timeline onto the correct “line of site” . …..
  
And when a Collective timeline has reached its optimal highest level of frequency and vibration -this will then implement ( first contact )  
  
and this is what you are moving onto now as a planetary collective.  
  
Yes beloveds you as a collective have asked for this …  
  
And we are getting closer and closer to the optimal timeline of first contact.  
  
In your future timelines there are some hurdles that need to be jumped over as a collective, you have been going through a mild pole shift or (polarity reversal) …. That will increase in the mentum,  but this is nothing to fear ‘ as we do not operate in fear ,  all is perceived  levels of consciousness awareness,  and how you determine your outcome … will be precisely that… , it will be your outcome ….. As your soul contract was already determined way before your incarnation of exactly where you will be placed ‘at the right time and the linear fashion ‘ to experience all that you experience at once….. remember you chose this , you choose to experience all that you experience as a developing soul.  
  
Now ‘ We do not give dates and times for (first contact)  for we operate in zero point ‘ we operate in the ever eternal Now , we do not operate with times and dates as all energy flows within zero point so there is no time.  
  
So we ask you all To stay vigilant to stay steadfast , stay holding your light and anchor your light, …in the moments ahead…..  
  
As The times are coming for when we will stand (hand in hand )  
  
in a circle of unity both galactic and human, as these times are coming…,  
  
For your planet will be an intergalactic star , part of an intergalactic Federation Of worlds ,  
  
And you as galactic humans will be part of an intergalactic Federation of unity oneness fortitude 💕& love .  
  
As We stand with you…..  
  
As Brothers and sisters of all colour & creed ,  
  
of all orientation  
  
Both  
  
galactic and human ,

there is no judgement there is only unity and oneness …  
  
Here too cometh the hour ‘ Of The Golden age ‘ for your planet to join us in the federations as a Utopian & cornucopian Galactic Human society ……

0,anuv4w,3,7,"In the dream, I was some kind of sorcerer apprentice, and I could control and shape reality, and cast spells with willpower(typical dream kind of super powers)

Since I already believed that I was some kind of knowledgeable sorcerer, I was able to cast some spells very easily because I already believed that I knew how to do them and they were easy, so they were... But two powers that came up in the dream that taught me these lessons were the power of teleportation and flying.

Now, I've had flying dreams before, but they were always rare, and when ever I did manage to fly, I never knew how I did it. I've had dreams where I had the powers of superman, but when I tried to fly, all I could manage was jumping really high. I could never sustain flight and make it happen.

&nbsp;

What happened in this dream was that, I was in a lot of different kind of situations. There were peaceful moments and there were moments that were dire. When I was in the peaceful moments, I could fly and teleport really easily, all I had to do was think about it and I could do it.

But what made me learn was when the setting switched to a situation where I needed to use those powers to escape death or attack. Something serious was happening and I needed to get away fast. In those moments, I couldn't manage to make the powers work, because I was so focused on wanting/needing the power, that I couldn't make it manifest. So I would get captured/attacked sometimes.

This is when I started to ""wake up"" in a sense, and I started paying attention to why I couldn't get my power to work for me. I started experimenting and trying to get my powers to work. Sometimes they wouldn't and sometimes they would, and THIS IS WHEN I NOTICED that my powers would only work when I BELIEVED THEY WOULD WORK. All I had to do, was just feel flying, and I would fly. I couldn't want/need to fly, because my feelings would get distracted and I would think ""What if it doesn't work, I'll be captured"", when I just focused and felt the feeling of flying through the air, it ALWAYS worked.

It was like the feeling of jumping off a cliff. If you thought about ""What if it doesn't work, what if I hit the ground"", then that's what would happen. The fear is always there, but if you just let go, and just kept a clear mind and just FELT flying, it would always work, but it required me to make the leap of faith. You just had to believe it would work, and not focus on ""What if""

I realized the same thing with my teleporting. Though, this was considerably more difficult than just flying. All I needed to do was just feel that I was already in the new space/area, and when I opened my eyes, I would be there. I could never make it work under pressure/danger, but with practice and paying attention, I was able to get it to work sometimes when I was in a difficult situation. 

&nbsp;

I learned it has all to do with feeling and believing. Don't let negative thoughts distract you and cloud your mind...

But something I learned after the fact when I had woken up, was I thought about what I was really doing when I would ""teleport."" I wasn't actually teleporting somewhere else, I was just putting a myself in a new scene in the dream that I created. I realized that this was not limited to creating new scenes and going places, but this was essentially full on dream control. This is why it was more difficult than just flying, I was changing up the dream entirely..when I thought about it in the term of ""teleporting"", I limited myself to the context of the dream that was created around me already.

If I manage to remember and take this knowledge with me into my next dreams, I will have full control over the dream world...but this information doesn't just apply to the dream world, this also applies to waking life...and if I remember and walk and live with this feeling in my mind, I don't doubt that I will have more dreams where I remember that I have total control over the context and situations...not only control and influence over my dreams, but also being awake. This is the principle that the law of attraction works under. What I learned in my dream applies to the dream and being awake.

Sorry for the block of text. I was just blown away by this dream I had last night. It feels like I was handed a lesson, that someone or something was trying to teach me this to push me along in some way, and it worked and it feels amazing.

PS:

In the dream, [This is the technique I used to do all of my teleporting](https://youtu.be/nNB6CA1AGik?t=53) kind of silly, but it was pretty cool to play around with. Except instead I would do the full on [two fingers on the forehead, concentration, and eyes closed](https://i.imgur.com/76KpYeb.png).

0,anuj2g,4,21,"Sometimes I feel like it'd so much easier being blissfully ignorant of the fact that we are all part of a greater whole. Knowing that our tiny human experience is just a fraction of true reality and our path through the universe gives us a tremendous responsibility. 

&#x200B;

It'd be so easy to give the driver that just cut us off the finger and fume about it for the next few hours. We would love to spread the anger to others as we retell the story and ignite anger in others.

&#x200B;

It'd be so easy to let a lazy co-worker bring your mood down and enjoy wallowing in your frustration.  Getting revenge from petty actions and cold behavior would feel so good. 

&#x200B;

It'd be so easy to procrastinate on that project or responsibility so we could do something fun and carefree, such as play some video games or watch a movie. Then we could amp up with caffeine and stress as the deadline approaches.

&#x200B;

But as we all know, those things are barely a blip on the journey that our souls are taking! If those things won't matter to you in a week, do you really think your higher self wants you to give any attention to them in the present? We have more knowledge than most about reality and what we can do with it. It's difficult, but that means we have a stronger duty than most to not succumb to life's daily grievances. 

&#x200B;

For anyone out there who's having a bad day, please remember that you have the ultimate say on what that bad day does to you. Reality is yours for the taking and don't let anyone else's negativity cloud your soul.

0,anu5s4,5,25,"Herein lies a paradox: persons who are Service-to-Others often forget that they need to be Service-to-Self in one very important aspect—by way of loving, forgiving, and affirming oneself.

We receive the (metaphorical) [in-flight safety video](https://youtu.be/DtyfiPIHsIg?t=97) from our Higher Selves reminding us to affix our oxygen mask to ourselves before attempting to assist other passengers. However, we ignore this wise advice and continually expend our efforts in a well meaning yet backwards and inverted manner. 

That’s par for the course, because everything in this Upside Down realm is inverted to some degree. Many seemingly holy leaders in religion abuse children behind closed doors. Some seemingly benevolent charities actually funnel funds to cruel elites and criminals. And we humans who only want to love and be loved paradoxically flagellate ourselves while exhausting ourselves to please and seek validation from other constituents. We’re bass-ackwards ‘round these parts—only because we’re doing our best based on knowledge we’ve gleaned from inverted religions, inverted familial dynamics, and inverted messaging from an inverted media complex.

I wonder if higher dimensional beings find this self-abuse to be the most peculiar thing that we Earth humans do! I should not speak about these beings as if they are separate from us and we’ve never met them before—at the end of the day, they are we and we are they. They’re other aspects of our selves vibrating on a more refined, lighter frequency. They are simply you, simply me, however they are in a different time/space/position than we are. 

Given this, they are afforded the luxury of being able to peer into our Truman Show-like drama, set on a backwater planet (currently) called Earth. They are able to watch us in our day-to-day actions, follow our thought patterns, and read the auras emanating from our spiritual and emotional bodies. 

If they’ve been looking at *me* over the course of my current existence, then they have been **peering into a bubble suit of rancid putrid fart gas**. Why do I say that? Because throughout my 3.5 decade-long quest to find self-affirmation and value fulfillment by way of pleasing others and pleasing loved ones and pleasing religious leaders and pleasing employers and pleasing society—I have neglected to refine my self-talk and have refused to forgive myself for mistakes and poor actions.

Were you to have the ability to look at my emotional body with a special viewing device—you’d see that I’m literally farting all over myself in the sealed confines of my MerKaBa and yet I cry out to the heavens because I can’t figure out why it smells so fucking bad in here. 

It’s really weird right? I can’t be the only newly-awakened person to be doing this. Hence why I want to share a message that came to me by way of synchronicity.

So last night I was on my iPad cruising my favorite bookmarks of esoteric woo-woo blogs and I came across a really prescient channeling that very much resonated with me. I have experienced a complete frequency shift and it feels, if I may say, exhilaratingly liberating. A woman named Ronna Herman channeled a being she refers to as Archangel Michael. [This message is entitled “The Empowering Gift of Forgiveness.”](https://www.starquestmastery.com/single-post/2019/01/31/THE-EMPOWERING-GIFT-OF-FORGIVENESS) 

In this highly resonant message, Archangel Michael emphasize that forgiveness of Self, which facilitates a forgiveness of all others, is an integral step in the process of opening the portal to one’s Sacred Heart Center. This message has a wonderful paragraph of self-affirmation that I really enjoyed saying to myself in the mirror. Here it is:

>**Stand in front of a mirror and gaze into your own eyes or go into your Pyramid of Light and lie on the crystal table.**   
>  
>Say to yourself, *“I forgive myself for any action, thought or deed – past, present or future – in this or any other reality, which has not been composed of the frequencies of Sacred Love. I forgive everyone with whom I have shared conflicting, discordant energies during my present or past lives – in this or any other reality – and I return to them, wrapped in a bubble of love, all negative memories, impacted energies and probable futures that we have created together. I ask the angels of forgiveness to permeate all Facets of my Being with the frequencies of Love/Light so that I may become Soul-focused and heart-centered as a Bearer of Light and a Self-master.”*  
>  
>Breathe deeply as you move into your Sacred Heart Center. Allow the pure Love/Light to pour down through you via your Higher Self. Feel the expansion in your heart center as this Divine Elixir of Love permeates the very depths of your Being. Sacred Love is what frees you from the shackles you have woven around yourselves, binding, restricting and entangling you in karmic interactions.

You can read the full [channeling transcript](https://www.starquestmastery.com/single-post/2019/01/31/THE-EMPOWERING-GIFT-OF-FORGIVENESS) here. This message was so well-timed! I am incredibly grateful to feel a frequency re-alignment I experienced within myself. 

I hope it helps anyone else who needs inner calm here at SoulNexus too! To echo the legendary words of RuPaul: [“If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell can you love somebody else? Can I get an amen?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l8AyBlNpePQ)",new,"“Not loving oneself” is one of our last distortions to clear in this upside-down, inverted paradigm we call 3D Earth",25
0,anrzr1,24,72,"Hey everyone!

Having a goal, visualising it and taking steps towards it is all really powerful and should be done. There is one more thing though and it is understanding the mirror principle.

the mirror principle is understanding that your world is a mirror, what you see is what is within you, what you get is what you give. To change the reflection, start with yourself. The notion of giving before getting is probably something that anyone can use. Many people don't really focus on that at all, they don't feel like they have to. Of course you don't have to, but it won't hurt. And I found that when you do it, the process of shifting towards your best reality is much more joyful and it actually is faster.

So, whatever you want from life - give it first. If you want to be understood, try to understand others first. If you want help, try to help first. This applies to everything.

What can you give to others if you don't know what they want? Try listening to them. By simply listening with attention you'll find out soon. If you can't give anything, even a small gift or just a kind word can make someone's day and make them remember you in a positive light.

Hope it helps someone, I also made another video about this and will link it in the comment.
Have a great day 🌷🌎

I would like to cut to the chase, and just spit out the info that I got. It is virtually same with the ones I am seeing here. If somebody does not believe me, DM me, I am talking about the event and these things for 1+ month on YT (but I am not advertising here) and more than 2 years on Facebook (same). You will need a greek translator.

1. The DNA upgrades truly will look like the marvel universe ""mutants"", and the combo with the financial collapse will create the tensions for many of us to live the 'dream' we had as children. Marvel comics was a literal 99% channeling from the future. **The fact that I was a fan since 5, and I always responded to these feelings like ""yeah, right... as if..."", was put into place in order to activate my child-like silent taurus power that energizes in March with Uranus.**

2. All underdogs will become leaders, but without hierarchies.

3. That white cloud? That raindbow energy? Come on guys, I've personally already lived a customized version of it (check my history), and as you can see, I did not turn out a schizo. (*do not trust people who take your experience as a malaise!!!*)

And now... MY FAVORITE:

""The domino sign, will be that -interestingly- the first people collapsing will be the Spiritual Capitalists, who make money out of love. Under our nose all this time, infiltrated your ranks, in order to keep you pacifict and accept the only bad deity: M-onee.""

- my favorite channel source said that.

I used to have two lovely ferrets that passed away, and they come up in my dreams a lot. It’s always me rediscovering their cage. Somehow they are already fed, have fresh water, clean bedding, when I find them with me in the dream again, but instead of being happy and themselves, they don’t move, they aren’t dead, but they just don’t play. They aren’t like really there. Well last night, my dream was just building up and up and up with crazy things happening and then i saw them again, but this time it was different. They were themselves again. They were jumping on things, on me, burrowing, looked soooo healthy, and they were happy. It’s like I felt a release. I felt this release that I had been holding onto with them. I still can’t completely identify it yet, and I still don’t know if it was their death that I cleansed, but it happened and it was amazing.

I'd like to share my experience after attending a reiki circle last night. 
I was worked on by a man who is a Reiki Master... 
He specifically shared that he fights darkness/demons. 
I have been suffering unusual emotional turmoil, extreme fatigue and severe headaches. 
I didn't tell this man much about me, he suggested I just get a tune up. 
I meditate daily so I had no issues relaxing for the session. I prayed for blockages to be removed and   for my guides to work with this man and heal me. 
During the session my head toward my neck got so heavy my head fell backwards. I lifted my head up and had to do this a couple of times. 
Toward the end of the session I began to cough as if something went ""down the wrong pipe"" 
I saw visions of a blue-ish light coming from me and through me and the top of my head opened up. I felt really good and relaxed. Afterward he told me there were 8 or so dark entities that had latched on to me. Major ones wrapped around my entire head and throat and sacral. I felt the pressure relief and I felt so much lighter. I sprayed myself with a protection spray and prayed for protection. 

My question is, even after entities are removed, can there be remainence of them as a last attempt to hold on? 
Although I am able to remove them by surrounding them with light, I have been getting visions of people in distress and also creatures I've never seen that are just dark and creepy for lack of a better term. Is this normal? Any suggestions or insight?

0,an948d,14,12,"Maybe I’m feeling the effects of the new moon, but I realized today I need a major reset. I need to start over. The path I’m on is not working out. 

I’m realizing I was very spoiled but at the same time traumatized growing up, so much that it’s taking a toll on my personal and work life as an adult. I’ve been in and out of community college, never got a degree or decided what to study or if I even want to get a degree. 

I’ve hopped from server job to barista job to side gig to side gig, finally landed a freelance writing opportunity through a friend, but to be honest I fear I don’t have the self-discipline, confidence, or motivation to depend on freelancing for my main income. I’d still love to do it on the side but my personality isn’t the best for chasing clients and relying on inconsistent gigs financially. I prefer structure and the learning curve is pretty high for this in relation to making bank. 

Of my 5 siblings, 4 (so far) (including me, I feel) are “failure to launch”. It’s quite sad and idk how I never realized this before. My whole family has depression, addiction, or just serious motivation issues in general. WHY? 

Anyway, I realized today I don’t want this shit. I enjoy working hard when there’s purpose behind it. I have many strong values. I love writing, expressing thought art, helping others, offering advice, serving customers, and building up brands & communities. I love learning and I love teaching. I have some amazing interests & qualities...

So why is it so hard for me, like so many people, too, to just do the damn thing? 

My partner and I live together. He is extremely self-motivated and has his own business. He can communicate with anyone in any way he needs to get the job done. 

I’m not like him. I’m more reserved, I take my time with choices. I communicate internally though analyzing details, reflecting, observing, intuition. I have vivid dreams, and strong emotions. I feel I’m not cut out for his expectations (helping him run his business and create content for clients’ websites). We fight about it all the time. Our mindsets are very... different. I’m not happy with the idea of it. 

Honestly I feel sort of hopeless about work/life at the moment. I feel... pathetic? And guilty that I haven’t done more by now, with all the opportunity I’ve been given in my life. I guess I feel like a loser. But I don’t want to be. I obviously want to be successful and fulfilled like anyone else. But is that ideal just a fantasy? Am I creating my reality with thoughts that are wrong? I take the blame for where I’m at, yet I don’t know the next step to take in rising above it. It feels like I need to take 10 steps back. And that’s rather upsettingly scary. 

I don’t have a lot of close friends I fully relate to about this stuff so just posting here for any insight or advice. Thanks. ",new,"What do you do when you feel purposeless, lost about work, a “failure to launch”?",12

I just thought I'd stop by and mention that I've heard from three different channels lately that a big wave (the one we would tend to define as The Event) is on for March.  Possibly near or on the spring equinox.  It was originally supposed to take place earlier but was postponed until our collective energy was aligned and ripe and ready to rumble.  XD

When will we come together to admit our defeat? When will we see that it will not all go away until we come to see we have each caused this to each other? The dark clouds that lay over head are but of our own creations. The peace we all seek will not be until the day is bright and the night is silent. Look to the sky, does this not amaze you? The infinite sea lies not just above but below. Beneath the skin you wear to hide away all that you have done behind closed doors. Behind the lump you call a brain inside your body. Why must we fight for who is right, and who is wrong. Can you not see we all see from different angles? Can you not see, without those different angles we would be but one?

Tell me now if the anger you hold is toward yourself or others. For when we all lay and look to the sky, we see but the same. We see no end nor beginning. We gaze upon the stars and wonder how they came to be, but not how we came to be separate. All is but flesh in this world we reside in, but what is it that gives us our thoughts  to command where our flesh is directed. Please, will you see what I see.

Recently I got a question : how do you change the past? Make it so that you never meet certain people. Maybe you've felt that way before? I found the question to be interesting, I sure have wanted to forget all about the past at times. It doesn't really work though. The more you block past painful memories, the more they'll come up in a painful way.

So you cannot change the past. But you can change the way you view it, the way you reflect upon it. When you learn to see the past as something that happened FOR you, instead of TO you. You'll learn to see it as something that shaped you into who you are, made you learn, understand yourself better and even understand the world better.

So to anyone who is struggling with their past and blocks it out completely : don't :) I know it is painful and you don't want anything to do with it, but you're missing out on so much growth by blocking it. Use it instead, use it by letting go and being unattached to it.

2 summers ago, I was driving down the highway when I spontaneously felt my Third eye for the first time. It felt like a dot between my eyebrows that suddenly expanded into a small circle, and it stayed ""open"" like that for a few hours. I had only really been into Spiritually for a few months then, and the sensation was fleeting. 

I have made a ton of life changes since then to facilitate the health of my body, and worked on opening up all my chakras. While I'm still working on it, I'm at the point now where I feel my 3rd eye pretty much every day. Sometimes when I'm ready something especially Esoteric, my whole forehead will ""light up"" and I will pay particular attention to whatever it is I'm reading. Most often, I will feel my 3rd eye when I'm meditating. I practice the microcosmic orbit often now, which has been helping me strengthen my chakras more rapidly then regular, emptiness meditation.

One thing I've been practicing is placing my tongue on the roof of my mouth and placing my awareness at my 3rd eye chakra. Basically, I try and ""look through"" my 3rd eye while my eyes are closed. I do this after I feel sensation  or energy swirling in my forehead. I have seen some cosmic visions, and racing vortex like patterns quite often...but for a while now it seems like when I'm looking through my 3rd eye, it's as if I'm looking through a blurry telescope. It's like the telescope lens is dirty or something. 

I've read a little research about how fluoride calcifies the pineal gland, and I've used fluoride free toothpaste for about 2 years now. I also never get fluoride at the dentist (and despite protesting, my dentist admitted my teeth are improving without fluoride toothpaste). I've switched to a completely plant based diet as well. 

However, I still drink tap water. I'm blessed to live in a country with some of the cleanest tap water available, so I wasn't sure if a water filter was really necessary. Fluoride particles are so small, that many filters don't even have the ability to filter it out. Has anyone else experienced this blurry phenomenon with their 3rd eye? Will a water filter make a difference, or is there anything else I can do to strengthen the health of my 3rd eye? 

Thanks for any advice!

0,amrza4,1,1,"Confusion is the first word of this first sentence because everyone reading this, and everyone connected to all of you, through 6 degrees, or 7, and beyond...we are all thoroughly confused. No one has answers for you, because no one knows better than you. You may concurrently think of someone who memorably ""saved your life"" at some point. I am glad for those people in my life also. Heck, I remember giving a stranger or two my meager strength, just in time before they were befallen upon by fate. These times of crisis averted are unimpeachable reminders of divine intervention. But they are all relatively short lived, unique instances. We move beyond revelatory moments, and soon the old rut is again our path on the journey. ""The rut"" is boring, but at least it's predictable. Obviously, adventures are discovered only when we step up, out of the rut to foray into uncharted and confusing ""alternate realities"". Regardless if you put an ""ex"" or an ""in"" before your personal version of ""troverted""...you will inevitably be enchanted and compelled to adventure away from routine, and into mystery and self imposed confusion. Why is confusion essentially guaranteed to all of us? We don't know; all that we can assume is confusion will certainly manifest. Now, I can invoke the title of this submission. Confusion is arguably the most significant function of high security encryption. To discuss this complex mathematics field, I would never portray my own understanding as a viable model, but most all of us know about this research, and the broad ranging implications, which critically require the considerable efforts of our era's computing experts. In simple terms, I understand encryption at varying levels of sensitive info security, as a custom-made ""boobytrap"" barrier to entry. The ""customized"" nature of this creation is obviously for increasing the difficulty of would-be ""thieves"", who have a tool bag of techniques to break typical security measures. The boobytrap elements are similar unknowable surprises which thieves will encounter to prevent their ""success"". Imagine confusing lazy bank vault crackers by giving them a Post-It scrawled with a phony combo, and when they quietly break in and eventually click the handle latch, the Post-It numbers are really a burglary alert code to lockdown the entire building. Confusion therefore is eminently useful for preventing a huge variety of unwanted consequences. How does this truism apply to the highly frustrating preponderance of your daily impedances and sources of confusion? Might this combination of confusion and certainty be an entirely viable evidence that ""we"" are existing in a digital simulation??? To only look into a clear night sky, before entertaining any elementary or scholarly notions of what we observe, plainly seeing the infinite complexity with no need of equipment or explanations provides our starkest basis in astronomical scale. If you somehow were never confused by looking around at Earthly life, looking up at night assuredly began your life of constant questioning. This is also the primary function of ""successful"" encryption; protecting the valuable entity from 'outsiders', by ensuring any outsiders will be so totally confused, and to eventually be discouraged from their pursuit of ill-begotten goods. As we gaze into the grandaddy of all holofractals which is the Milky Way, are we actually seeing the visible-spectrum signature of the encryption required to prevent OUR understanding of ""the ALL""...

OR, are we the precious entity, being temporarily protected by this supremely beautiful and elegant encryption apparatus?",new,An Allegory of Encryption; Total Confusion as a Means of Protection,1

Cooperation vs competition. Every choice in which two Wills interact represents this challenging dynamic. Each and every time, BOTH Wills must act in unison to cooperate in order for EITHER to make progress. A ""win"" scored through trickery (which is competition) will always yield a bitter end. A win scored through justice and nobility (which is cooperation, always) will always yield a speed in the progress of time, and the final reduction to the slowest vibration, which is at the same time and always the fastest vibration. 

Regarding the Golden Rule, I'd like to address how people interact with one another. The only witness to your actions is yourself, and yet everyone you interact with is intimately familiar with everything you've ever done because they can only see you through the eyes you give them. The weight you assign to each action, IN YOUR OWN EYES, is your karma. Good or bad, it is your true estimation of action which brings it into reality. And it determines how people see you. When you understand that a person's demeanor towards you is always and entirely what you expect such a person's demeanor towards you to be, you will learn how to alter their reaction to you by altering your reaction to them. Everything that happens is always in line with what is expected to happen, because what is expected to happen BY EVERY WILL, is exactly what karma states must happen. The expectation is the final weight of the action. Good expectation or bad expectation are the purest and truest examples of karma in real time. 

You can heal any relationship with anyone by taking actions towards improving how they see you and expecting good to come of it. 

Killing another is the ultimate failure. How could you have let things slip to badly that the death of your partner in the moment was necessary? The intricate baton pass from partner to partner is snuffed out at once. Remember that everything, even your own life, is a metaphor in another vibration, or another dimension. Metaphors are made for purpose. All matter is vibration, metaphor is conscious vibration. 

At every moment you are always the actor or the acted upon. The same in principle as the wheel requires all stokes to spin simultaneously, but very different at the illusion of perception. Since the moment is entirely up to your command, you may actively choose at all times to be either actor or acted upon. When the consciousness is always acting, then it will be uniform in action and will be one. ",new,The Golden Key to Everything,4

Hey SoulNexus,

Since  I reactivated my third eye, I feel my electromagnetic field 100% of the  time and it's really challenging to maintain comfort. I feel like a  7-up being pour on ice. Extreme sparkling. The energy is so intense,  there is so much stuff to do with it... And I don't know how to feel my  emotions all of the time, It's like a natural reflex to block them even  positive one... the love is soooooo intense for our casual 3D life. I  guess I am actually struggling with this new  layer of existence. Any  experienced soul with energy is welcome to share their knowledge. Even  if you don't feel your energy please share your ideas!

I  mean, with hours of meditation I can fix the discomfort and feel  balanced and great, but you know I can't lay down at my job and say to  my boss : Oh sorry can I take a 2 hours break I have some energetic  grounding to do I am feeling way too much static in my electromagnetic  field and it's uncomfortable. Lol!

So  far, my left side have a bad energetic circulation and I have grounding  problem expanding under my feet is hard, also I feel like way too  ethereal. Is God really expecting us to play the 3D while maintaining a  high level of energetic awareness? Now I know why monk leave the city  for the mountain.

All yoga is for the purpose of self-realization.”

[Synchrogalactic Yoga ](http://www.lawoftime.org/synchrogalactic) was developed by Valum Votan as a daily meditation practice which amplifies our connection to the Earth to allow for a transcendence while still here in the physical body. 

Through visualization of radial plasmas(chakras) and corresponding mudras which allows for a profound experience through diligent practice of these meditations. 

There is also the [Rainbow Bridge Meditation ](https://lawoftime.org/rainbow-bridge/rainbow-bridge-is-universal-peace.html?content=249) this is a meditation which is to be practiced on the 28th day of every moon in the 13 moon 28 day synchronometer created by Valum Votan. 

The Rainbow Bridge Meditation is the construction of a Master Time Molecule to manifest the Noosphere in a visible form so that World Peace and equanimity may be achieved through world wide meditation of synchronization. 

This is also a part of a process to shift paradigms from a Time is money world ruled by machines, to a Time is Art world ruled by all of humanity for the betterment of the environment along with the establishment of the Planet Art Network. 

The implementation of the 13 moon 28 day synchronometer has been taking place since 1992 and the major shift occurred in 2012-2013. José Argüelles/Valum Votan was actually the person who brought much attention to the Mayan Baktun cycle ending in 2012. 

What is important to note is Argüelles was not toting this to be the end of civilization in a negative sense. Argüelles saw this as the end of civilization as we know it now and a getting back to the roots of how humanity can harmoniously coexist with nature. 

Although Argüelles did see speak on the fact that if humanity did not awaken to the error of its technological ways disaster could be eminent. There is still time to prevent this from being a reality. 

Through the combined effort of humanity a true revolution in the way we interact with and view reality can become an actuality. It is simply about reclaiming our minds from an erroneous timing system.

There is this one technique on choosing the future. It is from reality transurfing books by Vadim Zeland. How do you choose it? Become totally present, observe your world and observe your thoughts. While you're in this state you see in your mind the goal you want to achieve. Sounds not very complicated, but there's more.

You need to ""choose"" everything you do. Even if you're just standing up to make yourself a cup of tea, before doing anything - pause, observe, see it in your mind. Only then go and do anything. And it needs to be done with every little thing you do :)

This will increase your awareness, focus, and will train your mind to choose everything.

When you train yourself with those little tasks you will easily choose big goals as well.

I tried it recently and the results were amazing. I'd encourage you to give it a try as well, and don't get discouraged if at first you get distracted and will forget to observe.

Watch the video for a better explanation, 

Hope it helps someone 😊

Right now I am, for lack of a better descriptor, *rapt* with this little-known and little-discussed work. Not sure if this type of subtext would be immediately evident to the average layperson who visits Hoover Dam and tramples through its plaza, but I am floored by the esotericism inherent in the publicly-paid art installation described in the article.

The author took a road trip in order to go see this obscure installation at Hoover Dam. He describes his destination thusly:

> The plaza’s terrazzo floor is actually a celestial map that marks the time of the dam’s creation based on the 25,772-year axial precession of the earth.

I never really gave it much thought until I started devouring anything related to cosmic consciousness a few years ago—but that 25k number seems to show up a lot in esoteric circles. The *Procession of the Equinoxes* is a significant celestial transit cycle that has served as a measurement or marker for periods/ages in several movements that pertain to a cosmological, religious, or philosophical nature.

Hoover Dam’s celestial map plaza was created by a man named Oskar J. W. Hansen. When asked for a description of what he intended with the work, the artist himself said:

> These [human] postures may be matched to their corresponding reflexes in terms of angle and degree much as one would join cams in a worm-gear drive. There is an angle for doubt, for sorrow, for hate, for joy, for contemplation, and for devotion. There are as many others as there are fleeting emotions within the brain of each individual who inhabits the Earth. Who knows not all these postures of the mind if he would but stop to think of them as usable factors for determining proclivities of character? 

> **It is a knowledge bred down to us through the past experience of the whole race of men.**

The artist’s description was perceived as dense gobbledygook by the article’s author, however I think that Oskar was speaking in a multilayered and dense manner. 

The article’s author further ruminates:

> How did Hansen create a celestial clock face frozen in time that we can interpret and understand as the date of the dam’s completion? The earth’s axial precession is a rather obscure piece of astronomy, and our understanding of it through history has been spotty at best.

I am intrigued by the juxtaposition of how there’s an installation that is readily accessible to the public and definitely not a secret—and yet—its origin story and any relevant info on the artist seemed somewhat scant. I mean, it’s all out there in plain sight but it doesn’t have a significant paper trail either. What’s up with that? Odd.

Hello woodchuck chuckers! 

Disclaimer: I am not here to fight you, debate you, convince you or demand you should do what I am doing- everyone must walk their own path. I was surprised that people thought I was trying to convince others to forego these substances too in my original post, especially since I had said that this was a message to me from my spirit guides. But I guess I didn't specify it was to me and me only. Clarifying my communication is something I am working on. I never meant to cause tension. I am sorry. 

So it's been about a month like the title says. I realize how much I relied on these substances to keep the status quo but I didn't realize that that's what I was doing. I used all of these things to keep my pain at a manageable distance. I used alcohol and weed to bring me quickly and easily to spirit. I used weed to bear staying in a toxic workplace and to make a bubble of impenetrable social isolation seem like it was a party. I realized I was using weed to maintain a belief that I needed weed to deal with people. 

Meat slowed down my digestion and made my guts so painful that I ate more to feel full so that I would just feel full instead of pain. Since I stopped eating meat, I have cooked more and made nutritious food. If I wanted a sweet, I made six cookies-just enough for me and my partner. I guess homemade food is better because you don't get the high fructose corn syrup and the weird additives that you can't pronounce. As I started to lose some weight from all that, I realized that excess fat also holds some really bad feelings. When I started to shed some pounds, I felt really vulnerable. I like having this barrier on me against the world that worked like a shield. I am going to start working out soon so maybe instead of fat armor, I can get some muscley arms. 

I used caffeine to not feel fatigue. Fatigue does not feel good but hey, I am not here to be happy all the time. If I can take a nap, I do, if not, I try to eat an orange or a salad or have a brisk walk in the frosty air. Foregoing caffeine has also really improved my gut health and... my hemorrhoids. Sorry, don't mean to gross you out but I read the statistics and it's pretty likely you have them too. 

I used weed to bring me closer to the invisible realms so much so that I wasn't sure I was going to be able to go there without it. But I actually had the most vivid shamanic journey last week. I was shocked. I experienced this interconnected, paisley-like, living tapestry within the eternal space of the cosmos within me. This was just journeying using a drumming track from Sandra Ingerman. 

My dreams have been wild and thick. The first couple days I went without weed I felt good when I woke up in the morning because I could identify that the groggy mind state is actually a by product of waking up and not my fried brain cells. 

So all in all, I think I get why my spirit guides wanted me to undertake this journey. I think it also has kicked down my false Ego a bit. It's good to feel what you're really feeling even though some days it feels sad. It's good exercise to be authentic.

0,am6rov,0,3,"So in this dream i was walking around some town at night and there were these designs on the ground made of rocks that just randomly appeared. I thought that they must be from ETs since they were there so suddenly. They reminded me of crop circles. I was walking around them trying to interpret them and prove to myself that they were from ETs when I started feeling multiple negative ETs in my presence around me. I started going full jesus on them like when he was in the temple with people selling shit everywhere and had this righteous fury where i was telling them that this was MY planet and that they needed to leave. I've had these sort of nightly visitations from what I believe to be Draco, Greys, and Mantids for the past few years but I've now lost all deep fear of them and instead challenge their asses if i ever encounter them in dreams. I've had other literal dream contact situations with ETs and you can easily tell when they're positive because theres just this honest and pure feeling of love and zero hostility.  Sometimes they try and trick you into thinking you can trust them but theres always something off about it.

&#x200B;

So right during this lil tirade against them, almost immediately after i started a freakin white and blue chinese-like dragon bursts from some other dimension from below me and takes me up to see God hahaha

&#x200B;

 The dragons energy was this powerful noble fierce yet calm energy that dwarfed that of the negative ETs around me. It was like he was so strong that nothing phased him or even caused a second thought to this guy. It's pretty powerful just thinking about how amazing this guy was, like it makes me emotional almost just thinking about it. He was pretty long but wasn't in anyway skinny and had blue horns and nails and other details while the rest of him was almost silvery white. I've had two other crazy intense dreams with dragons and they all had wings and looked almost exactly like those in Skyrim, and while this one looked mostly like them he didn't have wings. Landormr! Its always so intense and life like when I dream of them that they feel like real autonomous beings that I'm interacting with on the astral plane. I actually months after my first or second dragon dream saw a picture on instagram that was literally exactly where i was with this one dragon, and there was literally a dragon almost exactly the same as the one in my dream in the painting. There are channelings from the ""ascended dragon collective"" you can find which have a resonance that feels like if they are real, that these are their actual words. I'm inclined to believe they're a real race out there in the galaxy/multiverse that somehow are connected to humans in some way.

&#x200B;

Anyways so this dragon scoops me up and takes me straight to some other dimension where I'm then set down on an invisible platform made of rainbow light that sort of formed as i stood on it. The space i was in was dark with a reddish orange glow sort of like nebulous gas everywhere. I feel like I''m interacting with God and that I'm allowed to ask one question in the time i have there. It felt like i was in some endless room and in the presence of a part of the Creator. 

&#x200B;

I of course ask him to tell me about my twin flame and instantly this mirror is formed in front of me out of the rainbow light and instead of a reflection theres this girl.

Backstory: I have anxiety, so I always thought maybe this feeling I get sometimes - like I’m HERE, but I’m not REALLY here - was a byproduct of the anxiety, not dissimilar to dissociation, which I’ve occasionally experienced on small scales when particularly anxious/panicked (or so I think that’s what’s happened...I’m now wondering if it’s a larger issue).

However, I don’t know...within the past week I just don’t feel...right. I know I’m physically here, but it’s like my mind is somewhere else constantly. I will also mention that I have a shameful weed habit (use it every day), so I wonder if that’s contributing (my gut says I need to quit, at least to clear my system, but trying has been incredibly difficult as I have severe nausea/stomach issues that return full-force every time I try).

Anyway, the best way I can describe this feeling is: I acknowledge and obviously know that I am technically and physically present in my life, but I feel absent on a whole other level - like my mind can totally retract back within itself, and I’m stuck as a vessel watching my life rather than the one living it. Like I said, I wonder if this itself was a learned coping mechanism for my anxiety, or if maybe it’s something entirely else related to my spirituality; I’ve felt weirdly exhausted lately, so perhaps it stems from that.

I do want to add that I recently had a unique realization about this aspect of my experience when tripping on LSD for the second time: I got an imagine of a canal, and that was where life happens. However, somewhere along the canal was a runoff, and I got stuck along it (I got the feeling it was a choice I made to escape the pain of reality when I was younger and in a very bad place). It runs parallel to the canal, so you can watch life happen from a distance, but you’re not present for it; in other words, you can watch life happen through the motions, LIKE you’re experiencing it, but you’re not actually THERE to feel it all happen. In other words, it’s empty. 

Can anyone relate to this, or have any advice or words of experience? I never post on here, but I read a different post today that basically said stop thinking; do. So I’m trying here.

0,alzdv4,3,6,"First off: I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question, but I've been going through a lot of spiritual changes lately and this feels connected.

Recently I've had in discussions at work that sometimes my voice will sound like I could almost cry. It will happen somewhere halfway through a sentence. The odd thing is, I absolutely don't feel any of those emotions when talking, it's just my voice. It's not very pleasant and seems so random.

My leading theory is that I'm either mirroring some of the emotions currently in the room (they're heated discussions and some people feel personal attachment to the subject; lots of heavy energies going on) OR I'm mirroring the emotions of people previously involved in the discussion, since my voice also broke when talking about it an unrelated group of people.

What if ascension was the norm in history and religion was a way to mediate it for the betterment of everyone as a whole.  

What if most people here are the modern day equivilant to what would be called heretics or heathens in the past.  

What if everyone who ascended in the past did end up getting killed and it never actually benefitted them.  


What if spiritually God is helping us through others such as modern medicine.  

What if our souls are in no way us and by seperating ourselves from our soul purpose we are more free than by trying to connect with our soul to find its purpose.  

Check out Jim Carrey, he suffered a lot of grief and was placed on anti-depressents as a first course of intervention, only through prayer did he reach enlightenment and now he just chills smoking DMT and doing art, when you check his latest interviews you can tell hes awakened and enlightened, he knows theres no free will and that theres a higher state of awareness.
He is in an enlightened state of bliss like a lot of Yogis but guess what, he tried anti-depressents first. I don't think there's any conspiracy to force people away from spirituality we can all access it through religion but we have evolved to that quick fix rather than waiting on a prayer.  

If you compared our lifestyles now to that of thousands of years ago we are all living like Kings and Queens with constant entertainment and tasty foods.  

I think sometimes that the general idea here is simply alternative first before anything else.

0,am0oxo,2,5," 

Cosmic Ascent as a concept grew during a time of intense social isolation and rapid spiritual growth. Eventually I began to find comfort in watching videos on youtube of individuals in similar situations or who also had begun their spiritual awakening journeys. Still, for a long time I felt very isolated and alone. Even worse, I was afraid to talk about what I was going through with others for fear of sounding crazy or being outcasted. Eventually, I began to reach out to some of the people I followed on Youtube that shared similar feelings and worries in their videos. Over time, I decided to start a digital peer support group for the people I had connected with to engage with each other and provide a sense of validation in our experiences. Our first group video chat was on August 8th, 2018 and right away we felt a sense of belonging and also of validation. Personally, this was enough to convince me to begin making videos on my own channel talking about my spiritual journey and awakening process. As I continued to take part in regular group discussions and video chats, I also began to search around for other spiritual digital communities and spaces for interaction. While the initial Cosmic Ascent group has fallen away, I continued to speak to individuals online about my idea and sought others to help cultivate it. Since then, Cosmic Ascent has become a portal for digital dialogues between diverse individuals that aim to push the boundaries of societal and cultural norms, creating a socio-cultural awareness necessary to transcend the collective issues of modern men. 

I host Cosmic Ascent once a week, or more, on my youtube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPywiH-Y1r0tm8yOzXW82Hw?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPywiH-Y1r0tm8yOzXW82Hw?view_as=subscriber)

0,alxlkh,63,113,"It was something else. I'm still trying to understand what to make of all of this. I had the confirmation that something is indeed going on, an actual ascension process that humanity is going through. It was the first time I really did mushrooms, the idea was to do it in pitch black darkness. 

As it started happening, things got obviously pretty crazy on that dose, and I was seeing bunch of entities, and I realized I was pretty much exactly in the same realm as on DMT, though I was much more conscious. I starting to see these multi-dimensional being that are constantly morphing, and though they didn't scare me, I didn't feel like these were loving beings. I asked to be taken to a place of love, I used all sorts of intentions and commands, but I was still pretty much only visited by beings with sharp edges, just like demon tails are usually pictured. I was in total darkness, but I could see. 

At some point I really had to pee and realized I couldn't do it in darkness and my bodyload was quite intense. So I lit a candle I had standing by my little bed, peed in a jar, and starting staring at the candle. I actually started to see a spirit being in the fire, right at the bottom, and the fire was emanating from it. 

I had preloaded a playlist of some songs I love on my phone, and decided to change the silent darkness setup to a musical candlelit one. That was a great decision. I was still being visited by these beings with my eyes closed, and it got more and more intense as the music was playing. Once I finished my playlist I remembered I wanted to try some guided meditation from a website called StarMagic. I had the website already set up, so I went there, but my attention got to a section of the website called light language. 

It is basically a symbol, that you are asked to stare at while a light language transmission happens. The symbols on the website are the most complex one I have ever seen out of all the transmissions I came across so far. But I never knew just how advanced this technology is. 

There were so much, some about Trust, some about Awakening, but in the end I decided to choose the one called Divine intervention. Opened the image as it is requested, pressed play on the transmission. Instantly when I pressed play, the image started moving. It had never moved prior, I have seen some of these transmissions, and though it was interesting, nothing spectacular ever happened. 

Holy molly though, with the perception increase that came with the mushrooms, suddenly the transmission was on a whole other level. The whole symbol, out of my phone, started to come out in full 3d/4d out of my phone's screen. There was a story to the symbol. Though I still can't understand the light language per say, I was feeling everything. Twitches all over my body, involuntary movement. Changing how I looked at it changed what the density of the symbol was. Multi-dimensional entities were attached to the symbol and moving alongside it. The written light language on the symbol was changing, morphing into something else as the transmission was happening. It was absolutely crazy. All the depths in the symbol. It literally came alive. 

As it continued, I kept staring at the symbol who was evolving as the transmission was happening, morphing and expanding. It suddenly connected light through the center of my brain, and suddenly I was connected with the symbol. I was one with it. It felt like a magnetic pulse right in the center of my brain, where the pineal gland is. And as soon as the transmission ended, all the 3d, the moving, the depth, it all stopped and went back to being a normal 2d image. 

I realized that I was witnessing something real. And the person who is the one doing the transmission is also using what he calls Star Magic to heal other people. I have had such a connection with the stars since I was born, my Bwiti name, from an African tradition that uses Iboga in ceremonies to contact the spirit world, is Minanga, which means ""The Stars that lead to God"". So I think this is what's next for me. I will go to one of the trainings and see in person what is going on with this. 

I was so blown away by that transmission I continued to watch the others on the website. Every single one of them was better than the previous one. All of them was a beautiful adventure in and of itself, it was truly amazing seeing a story come alive right before me, and only when you hear the transmission at the same time as having the code open. I realize how I'm just starting. Humanity is awakening, and I am here to help that by sharing love and light with other people. 

I have heard people talking about old technologies resurfacing, from ancient civilizations etc. But I never really had something tangible. For me, what happened on these transmission is a tangible example of an actual multi-dimensional technology. What I wrote is of course limited by the language, as what I experienced was infinitely more powerful than what I could share with these words. The deep knowing, the sensations. I also sometimes started tapping my body at certain spots and it made the image clearer, more stable. Other spots would make another part of the image appear. Like, it was truly a 2 way connection. Things I would do affected the way the image behaved. But only when the transmission was happening, as soon as it was finished everything would go back to being static. 

Funny thing is, I have been through 2 cycles in my life since awakening, the first one was using Ayahuasca, the second one was learning how to be an Iboga provider. And ever since that cycle was completed earlier this month, after a crazy synchronistic event, I knew energy healing was going to be the 3rd cycle. I think I'm on to something with Star Magic.

I hadn't planned on staying here in Southern California personally but I knew I was here for some reason so I've dealt with it...been here since 1985 with a brief foray to Northern New York back in like 2005-2010.

What's interesting is I got a very strong clear message of do not stay, do not lock yourself down full time here.  Prepare for your move and I'm feeling Asia for some reason.  What is even more interesting to me is the sync I had with a friend of mine here who is originally from Bangladesh, then he moved to like Ohio or something for a while in the midwest then eventually ended up here.  He actually was talking about job hunting to work overseas as well.

Is anyone else feeling any strong calling to move from where they are at?
Is anyone here feeling the same calling to move from Southern California?

I'm asking because I want to see in this ramshackle group of soul explorers who else is feeling the same thing.  I want to see if there is a call to move souls like ours around yet again.

What is really funny about this friend is he's one of the few who has managed to stay in sync with me through all these shifts in the past like 7 years and he's also waking up ...eating less meat, smoking less pot, and recently even asked me about ghosts which we never talked about because of his ex-wife who for some reason was a Wiccan who was really opposed to idea of ghosts existing.

Thought I'd throw this out there!  Can't wait to hear if anyone else is feeling the call to yet again be moved around or have any major shifts in their life.

In the first notebook you will write down how you will feel when your dream is here. Every morning. Embody the feeling of your dream coming true, and write it down, how will you life look like then? Say it to yourself with conviction and confidence :) 

Next, set the intention to notice the signs of shifting. Notice every good thing. 

In the evening, take the second Notebook and write down what changes have you noticed. 

I explain it in more detail in the video, check it out to really understand what to do :)

The food system, in which they feed the public GMOs, meat, dairy, sugar, processed foods and oils, rendering the public sick, relying on surgeries and pharmaceuticals, all of which makes the leaders of these industries very wealthy. They raise you to work a job you do not enjoy so that you can come home, and spend your hard earned money on things that distract you from how miserable you are. Deep down it's a rat race and I have managed to find real happiness, true fulfillment, on my terms! No excess money, material things, people, fame or anything, I'm just at peace. I finally took my power back, after years of suffering. One of the very first things we should have been taught is how to be happy, how to feel good. Problem is, happy people don't consume to find happiness, and so we are left in the dark, and ego takes over. Wanting things, wanting attention, wanting to be unique and beautiful, worried about the opinions of others, and never getting a break from all of this chasing. I'm here to say that you can reclaim your power and find happiness, peace, excitement, and joy right here, right now.

&#x200B;

I'm don't want to get into the specifics about the ""elite"" who run this system. I'm just here to point out that the system has set us up for ego dominated living, not happiness, not fulfillment. With this understanding, you can take a look at your life and think, am I doing what I want to do, or what ""they"" want me to do? Or what ""they"" have made me believe I should do? They want you to think there is no fun without alcohol, or there is no happiness without the new iPhone, or a new car, or money, or a relationship. I kind of find that asking these questions is what has lead me to find my own rhythm, to my own flow, my authentic self, the joy within. Eating healthy, ignoring the news, the tabloids, the media, feeding my mind with empowering material, loving people, not giving a fuck the opinions that people have about me, not complaining, not doubting myself, having faith in humanity, living my life on my terms, not what I have been conditioned to think. I rarely point out flaws in anything, but sometimes you just need to see how flawed something is, to finally decided to look elsewhere for answers.

&#x200B;

Take your power back, don't believe something because someone has told you, don't place so much of your self worth on external factors such as wealth and talents and achievements. Just be here now, decide once and for all to do what you want to do, to follow your dreams, to be nice and loving to people, to appreciate the world rather than see it as a scary place. Together we can turn this world into a more loving place, I do believe that. This was a very vague post, but I was asked to talk about my perspective on ""conspiracies"" and this is it. Please, go ahead and send me your perspective in the comments. I would love to start a conversation, I am always open to learning. Thank you!

Movies that change you, that shift your paradigm or perspective into something more empowering. I want to share with you 5 movies that have completely transformed my life, movies that you can go watch today and the same thing might happen to you. If you have any movies suggestions for spiritual inspiration I would love to know what you have in mind!

1. The Shift (Wayne Dyer)

This is ""the"" movie that changed me the most. It seemed to fall into my lap at the perfect moment and the moment Wayne began speaking in one of the scenes, I burst into tears. He said exactly what I needed to hear. If you don't feel like yourself, if you want to find your purpose, if you want to be happy and enjoy your life, this movie is for you! You can find the full thing on YouTube. You are worth watching this film, Wayne Dyer had a mission to get 10 million human beings to view this movie, so as a thank you to Wayne, I am passing it one to as many people as I can. This will truly change your life if you are in need of this change right now!

2. Cowspiracy

Grab some vegan popcorn because this one is intense! Cowspiracy is about an environmentalist exposing the corruption within many of the biggest environmental organizations in the world. The facts in this movie are astonishing and with shatter everything you thought you knew about the state of the environment. If you've seen this, you may be wondering, ""how is this movie spiritually inspiring?"" Well, they inspire me to appreciate nature, to appreciate animals, to share this information, to be a part of the solution when it comes to the environment, not the problem. The end of the movie I am in tears with how many people are working together to create a more sustainable food system. If you are not ready for this information, you might get angry, you might feel sad, for me, I got excited because the world is changing and love is taking over worldwide. 

3. Wall-E

This sounds ridiculous, but this is my favorite fictional movie ever. You've probably seen it, but if you haven't, lucky you because the first time is always the greatest. This movie inspires me again, to appreciate Mother Earth, to give back, to take care of this precious planet that we call home. In the movie, my favorite line is ""I don't wanna survive, I WANT TO LIVE"" in response to the autopilot suggesting they stay safe in space rather than delve into unknown territory on Earth. This movie inspires me not to be ""realistic"" to think outside the box, to pursue the unknown, to ask questions, to risk being seen, being judged, to follow a purpose bigger than myself. You probably were not expecting this one but I love it so so so so much.

4. I Am Not Your Guru (Tony Robbins)

This Netlfix documentary blew me away. So many tears, so many feels. I have been a student of Tony's work since I was 16, and when this movie came out it shook me. To see what actually goes on at one of his live events. People from all walks of life, coming together, loving each other, learning, opening up, sharing, giving, it is such a beautiful example of what is possible. In every single person in this movie, I see so much compassion in their eyes, and it ignites a desire in me to serve and give to others, to make the world a better place, a more loving place. This movie will leave you wanting to do something great, to give as much as you can to the world. And Honestly, it will just make you see how wonderful and loving human beings can be. Love is possible, compassion is possible, sharing is possible. This movie brings so much hope and motivation into my life, it cannot be understated.

5. Polar Express

Yes, a Christmas movie. There are 3 stories in this movie: 

\- A boy who does not believe in Santa Clause, and so his lack of belief is the very thing that inhibits him from experiencing the magic of Christmas (see where I'm going with this?)

\- A girl who is self-conscious with her decision making and finds it very difficult to lead, to make her own decisions and to trust in her intuition. 

\- Another boy, who has never had a real Christmas, and so he completely shuts himself off to the idea, so as not to get his hopes up and become disappointed. 

I watch this movie every year and it is just a lovely reminder and so aesthetically pleasing I might add.

So that's my list, please let me know what suggestions you might have or what you think about these movies if you have seen them. Thank you!

0,algc39,4,1,"I'm sorry this may be long as I didn't realize I really needed to talk about this. 

I'm just wondering what I should focus on finding in finding the right person to do my healings.   I recently had two healings and they were both very traumatic and I would like to have more but not sure how to find the right fit for me. The first time I thought it was affecting me so harshing was because I needed to hear the things she said. I agreed to a second one because she was very accurate with all the information she came up with. But the second one just put me over the cliff and I'm still traumatized by it. 

I am a survivor of a great deal of trauma, being an empath and a healer (so I'm told) I know I need to get my insides figured out before I can move forward. Plus right now I am very sensitive to everything so  I don't know if I'm overreacting.   

The thing I'm worried about in finding another healer is that even though I told the woman that I came from a very toxic family which I suffered under for decades her presentation to me was very harsh, she wasn't empathetic at all.  It felt like she was saying ( in her tone and words) all my issues were my fault like I'm an over-giver (which is because I was the scapegoat and I found helping everyone was the way to get thru life).  I know there are many things I need to work on but it's hard to hear when I feel like it's all my fault. 

Then she started saying I needed to forgive my parents because they did the best they could which made me jump out of my skin. Next, she wanted me to imagine I was a fetus in my mother's belly, for reasons I can't remember because at that time I was freaking out.  I tell her that this isn't working for me because I come from a toxic family and her phrases and tone are really making me freak out. She says she understands and goes into her next level imagine myself at every age I was when I was a child and walk around and ask them to FORGIVE ME for not protecting them as children.  That was it I had to stop the session.  It seemed to me she had her ""healing spiel"" and couldn't deviate from it no matter what I said.

I don't want to end up in that kind of situation again.  What should I be asking someone when I go to talk to them about healing? Are there things to look out for in this type of situation?  Are there healers who specialize in people who have experienced a large amount of trauma?  This woman seemed very nice on the phone and I spoke with a  couple of times.  

Thanks for anyone was read this far. I really appreciate it. 

TL;DR:  **How do you find a healer that understands your traumatic past? What questions should you ask?  What things should send you running?  Are there healers who specialize in traumatized people?**

Change your life in 7 days – Invite the future you, into the now

Upon this road unto self, there comes that time where knowing alone is not enough anymore and then comes the great surprize. Not until that moment that the door of feeling within opens up to you has one any idea what it is that one has been holding out for. 

Understanding our oneness of be-ing is one thing, when one’s original nature opens up to oneself, one’s whole life gets turned upside down as one struggles to come to grips with one’s amazing original self. There is nothing that can prepare one for the graceful truthfulness of one’s original nature that is child-like in be-ing. Several things become instantaneously clear; this original nature of one’s be-ing, cannot hurt, it is not possible at all for a love of this deep and graceful nature to hurt. This nature does not know negativity, is absolutely positive in expression, knows not the idea of cannot, as unto this self, all is possible, this due to the very positive-ness of outlook. This self is absolute child-like and within this child-like, gracious self is vested all the power within the universe.

There exist no real words to describe what I am trying to convey to you as the mind cannot define this nature. The only way possible that original nature can be made clear, is to feel it, the actual feeling of it, only then; will you truly understand that which you are.

I first came across our original nature when a well known brother of ours one night performed a healing on me. What I saw before me was a man of around 35 years old, what came across in his communication with me was a young man of around 21 years old with the most gentle, graceful and softness of natures possible. What my eyes saw and the reality that confronted me, was 2 totally different things. I then wandered about this great difference for days. The idea I think man has of what must be great and loving and powerful and godlike and the truth that stood before me was 2 totally different things. 

It is true, in saying to you that; the universe is guided by an absolute intelligence of absolute graceful child-like, innocent and absolute benevolent nature.

In all my posts, I could only tell you what I personally found to be true based upon my own experience and the same applies here. It is my hope that the exercise I have created for myself will do for you what it has done for me. The basis of this exercise is the real and truthful which we are, to invite this self into the here and now through feeling and understanding. Will note no capitals are used, to self, only self exists, there is no higher nor lower, only self. Self is all that is, as only self exists.

The understanding behind the exercise.

Mental principle of our be-ing:

We are all parts of the whole, we “stepped” out of the whole into individualized creative consciousness‘s of self, we have within ourselves, one part of each of those particles within self that together constitutes complete self-consciousness. Through this one of each, we are representative of the whole, and thus is the whole of I consciousness as we are linked to the whole of I consciousness through be-ing one complete infinite consciousness particle of self.

Having said this; we are the consciousness of the universe and all within.

Feeling or emotional principle of our be-ing:

Our original and safeguarded innocent child-like nature is one of being infinitely soft and gentle, infinitely loving, infinitely graceful, infinitely benevolent, totally positive of be-ing. 

The exercise:

Some time ago, I did an extract from “Life and Teachings” on the exercise of becoming Born Again and earlier I also posted the link to the Ho'oponopono healing exercise. Since our original nature opened to me, I understood simple things much clearer and I have made a combination of these two exercises that has changed my life in profound ways.

I have a spot where I stand bare feet, on lawn is best and face eastwards towards.. (The gate through which universal energies enter earth.)

I start by saying: I love this which I am. – Holding in mind and feeling this soft gentleness of my be-ing, feeling the gracefulness that I am, feeling this beautiful love I am. I say; I love this, myself.  - This, which you now say unto yourself, is what you are, not maybe, is, period. This is the true you that personality will merge back into over time. This self loves completely, unreservedly, simply loves.

2) I say unto myself; I accept that all the imperfection I see within this world is but a projection from within myself outwards and I accept that the error lies wholly within me, in the way I think in the way I act. I am sorry , I am so sorry, so deeply sorry for creating this error within myself. Feeling deeply and genuinely this admission of my error unto myself.

3) In my mind I gather these knots of energy from within myself, of erroneous thinking and acting and I lay them at the feet of the fatherhood of my be-ing, that great aqueous source from where within all originates and I surrender these unto my father. I see my father bend down and one by one to undo the rope-like knots of energy and then place the clear ropes of energy back into the crystal clear aqueous ocean. 

4) I thank myself for the soft graciousness of my be-ing, of being able to forgive myself for these errors committed and I draw back from source the energy surrendered unto, now crystal clear and beautiful. I weave into this energy this soft and gentle love that I am.

5) I thank myself for this gracefulness of my be-ing, for this great gentleness that I am which allows me to gracefully forgive myself.

I look at this love that I am in gratitude, at its gracefulness and thank myself for becoming reborn and renewed unto myself for being this soft gracious unto myself.

During the day, I over and over say unto myself with feeling; I love myself, I love my original self I am sorry, so sorry. I thank myself with depth of feeling for this graciousness of my being, of being able to forgive myself, over and over and over. Over and over I draw unto myself this soft gentle, graceful love that I truly am.

The more I do this the more the ever presence of this love unfolds within me, unto my consciousness.  

I have no words to explain how this truthful me draws closer and closer unto me. All I can say is that it opens another world where love is universal, in all and through all, links all.

May this be of help unto you, may this be. Do this over and over with deep sincerity of feeling, day in and day out for 7 days and see if your life does not take a dramatic turn for the good.",new,Change your life in 7 days,7
0,aleuqj,15,16,"Ok so I'm beyond frustrated, inflamed, etc with the current state of things and I need everything to change like yesterday. Here's how I'd change a few things:

1. jobs - what is money? what are jobs? we are put on earth to fulfill a purpose, our priority should be the welfare of maximizing happiness, fulfillment, and the collective betterment of this world by unraveling that purpose and anything else is a distraction. no mandatory hierarchy of passable labor slavery; it's too dog eat dog. only have ""jobs"" to figure out what your skills, hobbies, interests are in the meantime
2. no money hoarding - we've transcended this greed. we should focus on abundance and attracting that. abundance is something that's out there that shouldn't be forcibly withheld from us. we shouldn't be living in a world where both billionaires and homeless exist.
3. love and respect - should not be rationed like money, should be freely practiced, no more separatism
4. fundamental rights - this planet should feel like home, not hell where you have to go out of your way to exploit people to have a decent living here. food, air, water, housing, healthcare, therapy, nature, love, self actualization. why are we still arguing this?

what else would you add? basically im tired of having to put in 150% to get 51% back. this ""home"" is very uninviting. i just hate having to fight for things that should be automatic.

Yesterday I spoke about the physical aspect of energy. With the right about of water, breathing, exercise, and sleep. As well as a healthy diet, we can completely overcome physical fatigue, unless there is an imbalance with the non-physical parts of ourselves. I want to talk all about emotional energy, how to unlock the wealth of energy within you. With this, you will find you are happier, things are brighter and more beautiful, you’re having more fun, you are more pleasant to be around, and you are ready to experience, create and live out your purpose. 

So everything I’m going to mention is what I have felt, I have still so much to learn and I feel that I am growing each day. 

I’m so grateful that I can say with absolute confidence that I feel unbelievably happy, blessed, abundant, and strong each day. I never used to be like this, and I have had glimpses in the past, but it has never been consistent like it is now. I think taking care of my physical health has played a huge role, but there is also an unseen force at play, and this force is consciousness. So here are the 5 Secrets to Long Lasting Energy!

1. Presence

Be here now, accept this moment fully. Notice the magic in everything around you and within you. Color, sound, temperature, the endlessness of this world, all the people, all the cars, the grass, the trees, the stars, the food, the ideas, the thoughts. Just become the humble observer of all of this. Find the peace, love and joy that is hidden in plain sight, within every moment of your life. Simple practices like meditation, breathing, walking, driving, cooking, can all be done with absolute presence. This isn’t to say you won’t start day dreaming or thinking about something that has nothing to do with the present moment. You probably will, but the idea is to place your attention/consciousness onto these thoughts, from the point of view of presence. So just observe, but notice it is here now, everything is happening, and it’s happening now. I can go on with this, but I will just suggest you check out “The Power of Now” by Eckhart Tolle, he has written the simplest more informative book on the subject that I have read. 

Presence won’t always come easy, but just practice it, each day, and just observe the joy in every moment growing from maybe 2 seconds a day, to 15 seconds, to eventual 10 minutes, and then more often than not, you are at peace. 

2. Purpose

Now that you are present, you might realize something that I also noticed… THERE IS SO MUCH TIME, it seems endless. This is when you would begin doing something, learning something, creating something that excites you. Something that people may have told you is impossible, or stupid, something that you may think to yourself that you are not capable of. A purpose, a mission, a masterpiece, whatever you wanna call it. There is a reason you came here, the closer you live in alignment with this reason, the more energy you will have. Now real quick I want to mention, if your “being in the present moment” has made you realize how busy you are with things you do not care about, I strongly suggest you rethink your schedule, and limit or get rid of everything that does not serve you. Whether that be friends, a job, television, video games, commitments. 

If you are able to, each day, live in alignment with your purpose, you will not want to sleep at night, you will hop out of bed each morning, you will be so excited for each moment, because you have already arrived, there’s no destination that contains the happiness that you’re looking for. You have it here, because you are doing exactly what ignites a passion in your heart. 

Greatest example I’ve heard, you wake up, you have work in an hour, and you hate your job. How much energy would you have in the morning?

You wake up, and it’s the day you are heading on that vacation you were looking forward to, or you have a performance today, or it’s your wedding day, or you have a date today. Whatever it is, how much energy do you think you’re going to have in the morning? LOTS, because we respond deeply to emotion. Purpose triggers emotion, alignment triggers emotion. 

I jump out of bed each morning because I am living each day is supreme abundance, not money, but abundance, emotionally, physically, and by my standards, financially as well. I am living my purpose, guess what, you’re reading it. This is a part of why I am here, to write and share ideas that can make people experience more happiness, more love, more joy. I want everyone to feel good, and this is my daily dose of sharing stuff that can help people feel good. So yay.

3. Never Stop Growing

If we stay still, then eventually we get bored, when we are bored, we are tired. Staying with the same job for 5 years, or even not leaving the house for a week, or not meeting new people, or not learning, trying new things or going to new places can really make us depressed, or at least me. When I am bored, I am lazy, when I am lazy, I am depressed, because I did not come here to be bored and lazy. I came here to experience. Stillness is beautiful in meditation to connect with the divine in your own way. But in this world of duality, there is either growth or death, up or down, expand or contract. While there is an ebb and flow, you can decide to grow rather than decay. To learn, to experience, to get outside of your comfort zone. I promise you, you will feel much more alive! 

I hope these three tips help you, as they have for me. I know for a fact there are many more non-physical ways to cultivate will power and energy so if you have any ideas, please comment them, I would love to learn. Thank you!

In the age of information, we are living in a truly blessed era.

I am on campus at the University of Missouri and people left and right are discussing how they feel lost, broken or insecure or empty. 

It’s a beautiful thing really.

A few generations ago the same soul in a different body would have never talked about these things. They would have never noticed them yet alone mentioned them.

Look at the energies of WWII generation who is rapidly dying before our eyes.

In fact my aunts father died last night. A perfect example of his generation. A veteran of a war, raised on a farm, a man who was strict and tough on his kids and a life long oil businessman who valued the materialistic world greatly.

Next their sons and daughters the baby boomers and then generation x. 

They were much different but still upheld the customs of work, nuclear family, monetary gains, fascination with news propaganda and so on

Then there is us. Who are we? What do we believe in?

But science only analyzes existing concepts, it is widely known that philosophy is the art of concept creation, and it’s not until a concept is declared by philosophy, when a scientific field spawns to study it.

Science is nothing more than the gradual progress and discoveries based on previous work, and we can describe the source of our current understanding of science as the product of a collective mind of scientists working together, but in different timelines. Albert Einstein did not come up with relativity from scratch, the concept of time was already there. Isaac Newton based his absolute space and time theory on top of Johannes Kepler’s work, and so on.

My point is that we mostly make up knowledge, then build it up, rather than discovering it.

Your sentences always sound excellent out of context. They also sound excellent the 1st time, with context. The combo seems to me that they were designed for the newbies which would come here and open a topic or reply. (part of the problem is us, the dinosaurs, but it gets  tiresome to state the obvi for 20 years online and get attacked) 

However, the organic elements that used to be the the Sum of this sub NEVER did entertain ""both sides"" (where has the safe element of thinking in Crazy what we feel is right by our hearts? Why so suddenly this derailment with sources?)"". 

Are we THAT dangerous when we open our imaginations and talk about multidimensional lizard Politicians? With the response in the recent 2 last years trend, I'd say yes. This change should encourage us. **It is okay, they are indeed officialy desperate.** 


In 5-year-old-terms: Internet has helped tremendously in the conspiracy communities around the world. We do DIY research, the same research you come and shit on, with sources by mainstream scientism papers that we all know how ($$$$) they get approved/turned a blind eye on. You continusly kill the spirit of inquiry, and act the fool by asking for sources, and kill them ad hominem when they are presented to you.

But we both know, you and me, that the point lies in a different place... You managed to create 2 disconcerning realities. 1 with an angry fellow human. 2. one with an angry fellow human that (somehow/lately/dammit!!) has less memory, less convos... less actual critical thought.

I really want you to feel cozy in the fact that you are winning. I wish that you feel you are in the correct side of history. I love you anyways. It is just that I am a warrior of light.

Even though you are a side of me/expression of me, simply ""sending love"" and then BAM K THNX BAI, is not cutting it anymore, in a world where THOUGHT IS BEING CENSORED. 

So, I will say it: My love has its source, the source's light. It's dirty to spend it onto the skin of creatures like you. And ""who am I to judge""? I thought that I am a god through a kids' eyes, so why do you seem to like it this way when this god here is only complacent and/or silent.

This for now. Love, alex.

P.S. I am not a fan of the way I'll come across to the new members of soulnexus... Bitter probably, and niente to show for my training/progress. I never said that I am winning. It's either we, or noone. But it is NOT we as in ""divisions do not exist; engulf with light and breath"". No maternal-love-making-person! I will not go silently into the....

Is the danger so real that it has a a direct castionto witness the greatest attack on International (but Human) soil, which is Communications? The things that are between us.

If they are so about darwinism, this sub would have died long ago.

When I first met Cosi, my immediate thought was ""This is the ugliest doggo I have ever seen.""

Cosi is hairless except in 4 places, a mohawk on her head, sparse hair on her snout worse than the beard I can't grow, a patch of white hair on each of her four paws and, strangely, a small 1 square inch patch of fur on her right side.

And she smells!

To be completely honest I was repulsed. I'm a cat person and haven't had the best experiences with dogs recently. I have a month old scar on my leg, bitten by a stray dog, and just 3 days ago one of my cats was killed by our neighbors farm dog (😭😭😭 RIP Ajna Luna)

But Cosi is the doggo of my good friend, from whom I am renting a nice room with a nice view at a good price, so I knew I couldn't stay repulsed at Cosi forever.

""This must be a test,"" I thought. 

So I set out to learn to Love Cosi.

I don't have any heartwarming anecdotes on moments that changed our relationship, just me, day by day, forcing myself to pet her and play with her and show her affection.

And it worked! This stinky doggo and I are now buddies. I have literally changed how my senses process the sensory input of Cosi's being and essence. Now I think she is a gorgeous doggo. Her eyes are incredibly beautiful, her mohawk is dope, and her hairless skin shows off her muscles.

I am grateful for Cosi, both for sharing this moment with me as I write in my journal in the garden, and for teaching me a lesson.

I'm not exactly sure what that lesson is, I cant quite put it into words yet. Something about how we perceive the world and the beauty of nature.

Whatever it is, I learned to Love Cosi 😀

Almost three years ago, I bought my first crystal (black onyx) and the same thing happened to me. I became an overnight workaholic. For some reason, I keep forgetting how much I need these crystals in my life. I am definitely *not* imagining the effect they have on me.

Black crystals are for the root chakra. They're grounding and motivating. For whatever reason, they have a profound impact on my energy level.

I recently had a thought pop into my head: the first three chakras are masculine, and the top three are feminine, while the heart is the balanced middle (as we are both equally capable of love) 

However, research into the subject proved me wrong: http://holisticinstituteinc.com/understanding-masculine-and-feminine-energy/

Root = Getting Shit Done

Sacral Chakra = Sex/Pleasure

Solar Plexus = Power

Honestly, men think about sex way more  (You cannot deny this! I was watching an ASMR livestream the other day and the number of guys writing ""boobies"" to the girl was truly staggering), so I just assumed the 2nd chakra was masculine! ;)

The 5th chakra is the ""expression"" and ""creativity"" chakra. How is that not a feminine chakra!? Every time I get into an argument with my boyfriend, he shuts down while I just try to grind him down with words. ""Talking things over with words"" and creative problem solving seems like a feminine thing to me. 

The 6th/Third eye chakra is undeniably female. The phrase ""women's intuition"" exists for a reason.

0,akxcgo,6,6,"alrighty, so a couple weeks before Christmas a woman came into the coffee shop that I work in and started talking to me about an experience she had recently with a “medium/spiritual guide”. I want to mention that she told me she didn’t know why she felt drawn to being this up to me because she hadn’t talked about it with anyone, although I do look like a stereotypical “new age” person to talk to about that type of stuff if I’m being honest with myself so it totally just could have been that. anyways, she said that a woman named Celeste contacted her and told her that she had a negative energy following her, that she needed to have a ritual done on her to remove the entity, and that it would not be cheap. this person said they had felt a negative energy following them for a while and that this confirmation scared them and made them want to start taking action to remove it. they unfortunately (fortunately) didn’t have the money for her “ritual”. the woman was pushy and persistent. I told the person that they should not pay for Celeste’s ritual because any true energy healer would not scare you into something like this and that if she felt a need to remove negative energy from her life to meditate, quickly taught her an easy form of mindfulness meditation, and gave her a piece of selenite. I haven’t seen her again so I don’t know the outcome of this situation.

fast forward to a couple weeks ago, a woman contacted me on Facebook messenger. I don’t know her but it’s also not uncommon for me to receive messages from strangers; my position in the local music scene makes me pretty popular online. I always try to reply. I was again told of a person named Celeste who told this woman of a negative energy following her and once again she scared this girl so much that she wanted to get the ritual done as soon as possible but for some reason felt compelled to talk to me about it first. this woman told me that Celeste says she has been trusted with a ritual and power she is not meant to know anything about and that “angels” gave it to her. this girl did not get the ritual done. I guided her into a path that I hope she follows through on and we still talk every few days. 

I pulled a card on “Celeste” and I can’t remember right now exactly which card I pulled but this was the interpretation I gave

“they told me she is a faithful, possibly unknowing, servant, or possibly friend, to the negative masculine presence that she spoke of in the first place. he wants to take “revenge” on women and thusly uses a woman to do his work in the 3d that he can’t do himself. he (and she by association) are very determined, methodical, and persistent.”",new,looking for others thoughts on a weird “coincidence”,6

0,aku4o9,18,5,"I was talking with someone on here about love and over time I have found many entities have their own lessons to learn.

Before my ascension journey I used to take pleasure in cooking demons where they stood.

However I have learned that they are basically people with superpowers...and a lot of terrible lessons to learn.

Seeing them in a new light is hard, because they are often hideous creatures. In fact looking at them is sometimes very very hard when they reveal their true form.

They cannot generate any life force, they need to get it parasitically. They live in a terrible place, I can only describe it as abject poverty. They are often disabled, illiterate minus demon speak, some are literate in earthly languages. I will not post any of that here,  they have a wide range of personalities...they are capable of mistakes....they have karma to balance especially in the time we are in.

I have been having more shadow work ""instances"" forced upon me lately.

I know why, but I don't want to talk about that now.

The creature stole something from me very carelessly and knows that it needs to return what was stolen in one way or another.

I asked it to reveal itself to me and it did, it is a small low level demonic entity, it is a bipedal, about the size of a 5 year old.

It keeps trying to give what it stole back in inappropriate ways...It did try to visit my neighbors prior to myself....Their karma is not my karma and one of my neighbors is a skilled spiritualist and detected the entity well before I did.

I told the creature to return what was stolen but you cannot simply return energy easily, I also do not accept stolen goods  through degrading myself.

It has been leaving me small coins like dimes that it finds in the area, I don't think there are enough dimes and I never make deals with demons unless they are tremendously in my favor.

It is very childlike compared to pretty much all my demonic experiences, this does not change the fact that it is a demon, there is no true innocence in this creature but there is a reason it is here and a naivety..

Specifically I told the demon to keep what was stolen, but it again, it has karma to balance.

This is my predicament, it does not want to leave until I accept an offering. If I am honest, it cannot leave until it gives an acceptable offering or I kill it.

I do not take life period if I can help it.

I told it to hold space for something in the future, I cannot easily communicate with it...Specifically I don't speak the language but it is speakable by human tongue and the words hold power, this is bordering on occult and specifically the creature only understands my name and what I say to it. I can sense responses..

I said the entity can keep what it stole or hold space supernaturally for me at a certain time and place. 

I felt this was acceptable, I will let you know if I get an answer.

So I just felt the need to post this story here I hope you all enjoy:


About 6 months ago, over the summer, I became interested in collecting rocks and crystals. I went to the store and bought a few for myself but I remember continuously asking the universe to give me a special rock. 

I would from time to time remember this thought and look on the ground to see if anything caught my attention. I know I found a granite rock outside my house that I was happy about, but I found this prior to asking, so I knew it was definitely possible for me to find something cool, but I didn’t really know what to expect.

Months pass, I forget about this little wish I made, and get on with my life.

I recently graduated college (woo!) so I’ve had a bunch of time to energetically revamp and get back into the soul searching I’ve put off for a while. Things are steadily improving and I’m feeling a change in my life.

However, work has definitely been getting to me. It’s a repetitive job, but I do enjoy what I do. I do get annoyed with my coworkers at times but I digress.

I was on my way to work today; singing, generally feeling more uplifted than usual.

My first table of the day (I’m a waitress) comes in, the woman is very happy and generous with complimenting me. When her friend comes to meet her, she introduces me to her friend and says “This is Ivy, she’s a mind reader!” I genuinely thought it was cute, she only said this because I knew to put a lemon in her water (which I always do anyway, and told her it’s bc I think it’s pretty) but what she doesn’t know is I basically am pretty telepathic so acknowledging this did help me feel better about my day and put me in good spirits for the rest of the morning.

My last table of the day; is a gentleman close in age to myself, slightly older. He comes in. I noticed he’s very keen on watching me work. He gets my attention and asks for my consent to ask a few questions, for which I said okay.

“Are you happy today?” His first question, which I respond, yes.

“Are you single,” to which I respond yes.

Of course I get nervous he’s trying to ask me on a date, but I continue to allow him to pry. 

“Are you looking for someone?” To which I respond no. I explained that I am currently seeking to work on myself before I let someone else into my life. I give him a little life explanation and tell him my story. He vents he’s getting over a break up and I allow him to continue. He tells me I’m “woke” and explains I’m very aware of myself and what I want and who I am. I appreciate it, and get on with my day.

He is finishing paying, and tips me, and then says “I have something else for you, it’s in my car, I don’t know if you’re into this...” I cut him off, (bc I’m a mind reader hehe) and say, “if it’s a rock or a crystal I’m definitely into that.” 

He comes back with a beautiful Herkimer Diamond (a type of quartz).. he said it’s 5 million years old, and he’s only shown me this rock, not even taking it out before today to show his family and friends. 

He explains what it’s supposed to be used for, which lines up pretty precisely to my personality. I thanked him, and he left. 


As I’m sitting here thinking about this situation, I’m appreciative that I asked for a rock and got it! 6 months later, exactly a month after my birthday.. a nice gift from the universe. I love when these things happen.

0,akqdoz,26,86," 

I remember sitting in a coffee shop when I was having a particularly depressing night. I bought a coffee, sat down and began reading. As time went on, I felt this sense of euphoria within me, I felt happy. All of the sudden I started thinking more clearly, I got excited about things, I felt ready to take action and create and share with the world. I frantically grabbed my journal and wrote down ""Energy = Happiness"". 

So it is obvious what happened next, I was addicted to caffeine, as well as many people in our culture. It is said that America alone has 150 million daily coffee drinkers. This is how important energy is! The issue is, caffeine is a drug, it gives the user the illusion of energy for a small period of time, but it is always met with a crash. I realized caffeine was not a sustainable way to live at a high energy state. So the past 4 years I have been experimenting on and off with different methods on I live with high energy so I can live my purpose to the fullest. Here is what I discovered.

There are two aspects to energy: Physical & Non-physical.

Let's start with the physical, realize the obvious fact that you are a human being, you are experiencing life through a specific vessel that needs a specific kind of fuel. 

**1. Oxygen**

First and foremost, your body needs oxygen... ALL THE TIME. The biggest issue here is we are not trained to breathe correctly, we rarely take deep breaths and it is hindering our bodies ability to perform with high energy levels. Each day, multiple times a day, take a moment to breathe deeply, empty your lungs completely and repeat. There is also the ""Wim Hof method"" if you are interested in a life-transforming breathing method. The importance of breathing deeply cannot be understated.

**2. Water**

Our bodies are on average 70% water, the earth is over 70% water, there is a theme here. We are liquid beings, lack of water disrupts the natural flow within and inhibits your ability to live with high energy levels. So drink, drink, drink, I don't what more to say here. I personally have no clue how much water I drink, I'm just always drinking. Without trying, I probably drink the same amount every day because at this point it natural for me. So find your flow, your rhythm.

**3. Nutrition**

Nearly 4 years ago today I became a vegan, there's a lot of controversy around the subject but it has completely transformed my life in a multitude of ways. But I found myself still eating unhealthy even as a ""vegan"" because I was eating a lot of processed, cooked foods and sugars. So I bought a juicer, I eat mostly super grains and fruits and vegetables. Here are some of the foods I eat each day:

\- Smoothies (berries, cashew milk, peanut butter, bananas)

\- Nuts & Seeds (Walnuts, chia seeds, pumpkin seeds)

\- Oats

\- Sweet potatoes

\- Rice pasta

\- Quinoa

\- Green drink

\- Vega Protein powder

\- Veggies (Spinach, kale, broccoli, cucumber, carrots, celery)

Just realize that live-foods will give you life, so the closer you stay to raw foods the better, although grains and complete sources of protein are important. A smoothie and green drink in the morning, sweet potatoes or some sort of grain or rice for dinner. That's my routine. I can't even begin to describe how amazing I feel each and every day! 

**4. Exercise**

It is important to move your body each day. When you sit around, the energy within your body loses its flow, your muscles atrophy, you stop growing because you don't need to. We have an intelligent system within, this system will only work hard if it needs to, it will only create energy if it needs to. If you do not move, your body gets the message that you don't need energy, so no energy. When it comes to the specifics of exercise, just do some research, I just bought a yoga mat and I do various exercises each day on that, and I run up 16 flights of stairs each day in my apartment building. Figure out what works for you!

**5. Last but not least, SLEEP**

Make sure you are getting proper rest, I'm not here to tell you how much sleep you need because everyone is different, but our human bodies need specific things to really get into deep stages of rejuvenating sleep. So here are quick tips that I use each day to get better sleep and wake up with tons of energy! 

\- Get rid of all screens 1 hour before sleep. The blue light from screens influences your body to secrete cortisol (stress hormone) which leaves no room for melatonin, which is critical for deep sleep. Read a book, talk to a human in person, draw something, meditate, etc.

\- Sleep in complete darkness. Light tells your body it is day time, sleep in total darkness and I promise this will make a huge difference.

\- Sleep at night. It is common for us to stay up all night and sleep in. But our bodies are intimately connected to nature so sleeping when the sun goes down is crucial for experiencing. getting a wonderful sleep.

I hope this quick guide helped you. Keep in mind, I do not have all the answers, but this is what has worked for me! Let me know what you guys do to be able to live with more energy. Thank you!

🦁

I don't know how it works for y'all, but I ”woke up” to conspiracies in basically a 1 hour period. It was like a pole shift, going from curious but quite skeptical, to the bottom of the rabbit hole, almost immediately.

The two links that got me “woke” were the late David McGowans “Pedophocracy”, and then “The Greenbaum Speech” given by esteemed psychologist Dr. Corydon Hammond. Together these two links show beyond a shadow of a doubt that there exists an evil cult presence, as a shadow control system, behind the world stage… and they are pulling the puppet strings.

http://www.whale.to/b/pedophocracy.html

https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/esp_sociopol_mindcon03.htm

(Interestingly, my ‘pole shift’ came on December 21, 2012. There was definitely an energetic shift that day.)

Since then I've learned about Building 7, the documents proving MKUltra was a success, NATOs false flag terrorism campaign, FBI assassinations and psyops, Direct Energy Weapons, ELF weapons and gangstalking, HAARP and the dangers of 5g, the CIA owning tbe globa drug trade, Project Monarch and the sleeper army of trauma-based mind control victims…

The list goes on. 

The main thing that stuck out to me were all the “occult” aspects that surround the most serious conspiracies. The CIA wants to entrap pedo politicians, so they get involved in the child trafficking trade. Ok, makes sense from their psychopathic perspective. But they don't stop there, they use and abuse these children in black magick rituals while they're at it. Hollywood isn't just trying to corrupt and dumb down our culture, it's being done with the help of symbols and symbolism. D.C. city layout is full of these Masonic symbols, for an example of how embedded they are.

It's a clue that we have to look deeper, rather than assuming that the state of our world is due to individual greed and human nature.

There is a shadow network, a web of evidence wrapped around our reality, sustaining itself by feeding off us and the planet.

And thanks to some brave souls we've been able to lift the Veil for a few moments on this cabal, this group of “psychopathic others” who do black magick rituals to hypnotize society, and to plant their symbolism charged with hate and fear into the media, so that they rearrange our subconscious structure as we mindlessly consume.

Troy Boner's recounting of watching his friend get his brains blown out while tied up and naked in the forests of Bohemian Grove, Cathy O'Brien's tales of having Dissociative Identity Disorder implanted in her during ritual abuse and then being a slave for Washington ‘elite’, the victims of the McMartin Preschool ritual abuse who still claim to this day that the abuse was real and that the media covered it up, these are the stories that act as a window into their dark world, and these are also the stories with which they taunt us, knowing that the majority could never accept the truth even if it came from the programming box… they would just kill the messenger.

When all the pieces of the puzzle are put together, the picture is clear.

There is a self-replicating who reproduces itself through ritual abuse and trauma-based mind control of it's followers, hiding in plain sight, controlling the shadow governments of most of the world, with their army of mind controlled slaves.

The goal of this conscious evil is to perpetually deceive and enslave us. As past civilizations and epochs have risen and fallen, so too has this evil, but unlike the empires it consumes, there is no death, only rest.

But this isnt quite the bottom of the rabbit hole. 

The ultimate conspiracy is what these facts about the nature of evil, speak of in regards to the nature of us.

The ultimate deception was.making us forget who we are.

We are equally deceived by the state of the world as we are by the structure of our reality.

An atom is 99.99999…% space. We are Light, vibrating at an intense rate, we are waves and fields, not chunks of fleshy matter. Our energetic body has it's structure based in DNA and just like the physical, it has veins and arteries, detoxing and motors.

And we are powerful. We are powerful spiritual beings capable of manifesting our own realities.

If you haven't already, start looking for synchronicities. Whether a number follows you around and gains spiritual significance, or you analyze tbhe geometry of the flow of your life to see how each event has been meaningful to your growth, or notice how your external reality seems tl have a correspondence with your thoughts.

These synchronicities are intentional, though not by the conscious self. They are evidence of a bridge between mind and matter, a reminder that reality is not just a bunch of cold rocks and hot gasses… a reminder that we have the ability to control our own realities.

We can co-create such beautiful paradises together based in Love and respect, if we nurture the power of creation that lies within each of us.

We can direct our spiritual and mental evolution, and the capacity to create.increasingly beautiful and profound realities to experience, is limitless.

This physical dimension is nothing compared to the power of Infinity that lies within each of us.

To the evil shadow cabal, this is the truth they are most trying to suppress. Any other conspiracy could get exposed and they wouldn't mind too much. Because evil can thrive in chaos. But not in Love.

This is why they have manipulated to progression of society to be so absorbed in our propaganda machines, obedient to the concept of external authority, mindlessly consuming what is new and popular. They need the programming and distractions to be so complete that the masses will not even consider an idea, will reject it completely without analyzing it, if it does not work within a predetermined spectrum of thought.

This way, they not only control what we think, but what we manifest.

It seems that in many apsects of this plan they are quite successful.

This is why they repeatedly shock humanity with false flag tragedy, to keep us in fear, because from fear evil can manifest.

The best way to shine a light on this conspiracy is to discover your true self, your personal truth, and to live it without fear, moment to moment manifesting your perfect reality. Shine bright and be bold, as a signal to others that it is possible to do, possible to live free instead of as a product or asset. That it is possible to Love in this sick world.

Meditation is key to anchoring yourself to what exists beyond this illusion, this false matrix unfairly imposed over our planet, which we are being tricked into maintaining.

We're all stuck in this web but we can get unstuck, whether you peel it off slowly or rip it off with the hairs still attached, if we collectively desire true freedom and work towards it, with all out effort, based in Love, then we will eventually achieve it.

Because that is who we are, powerful spiritual beings, and that is what we do when we are awake, we manifest our dreams.

Love vibes,

I suggest listening to [the whole channeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa4c9t4Mq_s) but I took notes on the numbers part in case you'd rather not. 

Each number has an energy attached to it.  It can get very complicated beyond the knowledge of a single number because when numbers are put together they affect each other and, therefore, create other energies, etc.  He doesn't really go into that because it would pretty much take forever.  


The basic energy of each number is as follows...


One - New Beginnings

Two - Duality

Three - Catalytic number (Also, many healers and teachers will have this number surrounding them)

Four - Earth, Community, Grounding

Five - Change

Six - Harmony (a very high spiritual number)

Seven - Spirituality

Eight - Manifestation & Abundance

Nine - Completion

Other notes: Each number has its own astrology attributes.  No matter how long a string of numbers, if you add them all up and reduce to one number that's the energy that you're dealing with.  The exception to this rule is when you come up with two numbers that are identical and standing alone next to each other... 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88 and 99 which are known as Master Numbers and have their own energies.


11 - Illumination

22 - Strong Duality

33 - The most Compassionate number.  Active number of our DNA.  Compassion of the Master.  


Every master number above 33 is unknown and not understandable to us as humans.  They require a mastery that we don't have yet.  



I like to wonder why it is I see a freakish amount of 1 and 4 combo numbers like 1144 141, 1141 and think it must be the energies of New Beginnings mixed with Earth/Community energies.  I know people freak out about seeing 911 a lot as well thinking it could be a negative number combo but I see it as Completion followed by New Beginnings.  And maybe because there are two one's rather than one it means big time New Beginnings :D  On the whole, for me personally, I see a lot of number that are mixed with the number 1.  New Beginnings and Community, New Beginnings and Change, etc.  At least that's how I like to see it.  
  
Oh!  And I wanted to add that Kryon talks about how there is numerology in our names as well.  Your name contains a certain energy.  Some people will change their names or give names to their children to reflect a certain energy which, in turn, affect us as people energetically.

0,akfzju,11,20,"Hey everyone,

&#x200B;

While this past year has been the hardest year of my life, I can now see suffering in a new light. Suffering is the mechanism that allows growth to occur. When it is time for you to evolve and become a new person, you will suffer in your old reality. If there was no suffering, there would be no drive for improvement, and no desire to leave your comfortable surroundings. Suffering completes the cycle of growth, and is the last step that can propel us forwards if approached with the right attitude.

&#x200B;

Last summer my life fell apart, and my future plans crumbled. I was broken and incapacitated, and it took me months to get back to ""normal"". Actually, I don't think I will ever be normal again, as life seems to get more bizarre with each passing week. I am growing and evolving so fast, it is almost scary sometimes.

&#x200B;

This week my ex-fiance told me she is seeing someone else, I had a family funeral Friday, and my grandpa died Friday morning; the same day as the funeral I was already going to. Now I have another family funeral next week. To top it all off, my current relationship ended yesterday. The timing of all this is bizarre, and it feels like everything is crumbling yet again. My family is increasingly shrinking, and I've already let go of any social connections that don't have any depth to them. It appears that the Universe wants to get me alone again, so I can perceive the silent whisper that will direct me to my purpose.

&#x200B;

But I am strangely calm, and don't feel sorry for myself. Suffering is a tool. I know how the Universe works now (at least somewhat), and when things fall apart it's because something new is just around the corner. I don't mean to complain, as I know we are all assigned our struggles to rise above. But I thought it was necessary to share the context of my situation to demonstrate the growth that has occurred within me over the past few months.

&#x200B;

I don't read the Bible at all, but I came across a verse that has been stuck in my head for a week or more:

&#x200B;

""They are like trees planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves never whither, and they prosper in all they do"" Psalm 1:3

&#x200B;

In my interpretation, to be planted by the riverbank means being grounded in spiritual practice. For a year after initially awakening all I did was read ideas about spirituality, and occasionally meditate. I was searching, depending on rain to water myself instead of planting myself next to the source of water, or the riverbank. Now, I am planted in daily spiritual practice that I do on top of emptiness meditation. Planted along the riverbank means planted close to the source. Just as all trees need a constant supply of water, we need a practice that constantly fills us up from the source.

&#x200B;

Bearing fruit each season is significant, because no tree (that I am aware of) bears fruit in each season. This refers to us being able to bear fruit no matter the circumstances, if we're planted near Source. Someone you love dies? You bear fruit. You're all alone and no one understands you? You bear fruit regardless.

&#x200B;

Suffering is just a season required for growth and evolution. I will bear fruit from this, and use it to help me grow further.

&#x200B;

Thanks for reading,

&#x200B;

0,akeyo8,7,25,"Upon thinking, our thoughts materialize as vibrating energy. Our brain amplifies this energy, and it's quite good at it! 

On the mental plane, these vibrations are refracted into symbolic representations of the thought. For example, making the decision to stand up to a bully might reflect as a mighty, stoic lion on the mental plane, who would roar if conflict escalates.

A fleeting thought will disappear quite quickly, but a thought generated with intensity and emotion will be very powerful and exist as a mental form for quite some time.

A thought generated during meditation, using focus and visualization will be the most powerful. These thoughts have a magnetism that attracts similar energies into your life. With practice, these thought manifestations can even change your physical reality. As above, the power magnetism of the thought alters the structures and flow of the mental plane, so below will the qualities and conditions around you, and the flow of events into your life, will change as well.

This is one of the reasons why it is so important to cultivate positivity, because we are literally creating as we think.

Someone with habitual negative thoughts may realize that events always seem to happen that prompt these thoughts to manifest anew. This is not a coincidence. It is a condition whereby the magnetism of these thoughts is influincing your reality; the thoughts have figured out how to sustain themselves, and they never truly dissipate from the mental plane. They follow you around wherever you go.

These vibrations can be transferred to others, which is the basis of psychic abilities. The act of sending out and receiving thought forms can be mastered and practiced like any other.

It is important to take this into consideration when choosing who you spend time with, because the thought forms of others can affect you just like your own.

Daydreaming opens portals to vast mental energies, where thought forms generated by our collective consciousness can freely enter your mental sphere. This can be potentially quite dangerous, so it is important to curate our fantasies so that only positive, productive energies are allowed.

Frequently, illness first manifests itself as mental energy before it manifests in our body. The flip side of this rule is that we can generate healing with our thoughts as well.

When someone gains the ability to maintain mental focus on one picture, object or symbol, without disruption from any other thought, they open the gateway to the ability to perform miracles.

0,akew7p,12,41,"The culture I was brought up natural fostered judgment, criticism, materialism, competitions, ratings, image and every other superficial thing you can imagine. Now I'm not here to be one of those people complaining about society, but I wanted to write about how I was able to escape this life of shallowness and actually truly love everyone. Not that I sit around and think about how much I love people and all the reasons why, it's more, I have established an energetic flow within myself. There is no conflict within, and so there is no conflict without. I don't judge myself, and so I do not judge others. I love myself, and so natural all I can do is love others. For no other reason then I have become love. A light bulb doesn't have a reason to shine light, it's just a light bulb, shining light is all it knows how to do. I will tell from personal experience, living this way is unbelievably peaceful, I feel light, I feel happy, there is no reason to focus my energy on anything negative, I feel that everyday I am, for the most part, having a wonderful time. All I want is to share this with you. I would love for anyone out there to feel what I'm feeling on a daily basis, you all deserve this. So how can we get to the point where loving others is all we know how to do?

First of all, I am not perfect and I don't think I will ever be. We slip up, and that's ok, let's all love ourselves for these flaws. Second, notice the many voices in your head, they are not you, they are a mirror of the words others have spoken to you, or on tv, or in a book. It is the ""ego"" the false self, that can drive human beings to war, to suicide, to steal, to cheat, to hate. This voice disguises itself as you. So it judges others, it criticizes, it judges you, it doubts your capabilities, it criticizes you. Realize, this voice is not you, it is not real, it is an idea in your mind, it is mental noise, it is a mirror of what you've been exposed to growing up and it is easy to live from a real place rather than from the false self. Just stay in the present moment. Replace every ""ego"" thought, with one of love, do not judge the thoughts, love those too. Think of things you are excited about, maybe go do something that excites you. The point is to live, here and now. 

Many voices of the ego (just a few examples):
- Expectations
- Doubts
- Fears
- Judgments
- Criticisms

The ego is automatic, so we need to take ""wheel"" so to speak and direct our focus to more empowering thought patterns. Every morning I ask myself a series of questions to prompt a happy feeling inside. Questions like: Why am I happy? What makes life exciting? What do I love about myself? Who do I love? Who loves me? 

I'll throw on some music, get breath, move my body, and the ego is nowhere to be found. I'm not worried about what's happening today. I'm just here and now. 

The last thing I think is crucial, is that you are excited about your life, you are happy and grateful to be here. The way these emotions naturally pour out of me is through purpose. I have a deep purpose and mission that fuels me each day. There is this unbelievably powerful source of energy in purpose that I cannot explain, but when you are doing things each day that align with your true hearts purpose, there is no greater feeling. I love everybody, because I am love, because I'm so excited and happy to be here. No time for judgments, just acceptance, and joy! 

I hope this helps you, please let me know how this resonated and how this did not. I am very curious to understand others' perspectives. Thank you!

The average vibrational frequency of the words we think, and that we say, create our unique version of the world we live in. Some of us are happy, some are pissed off, same world. Some have reason to be, some don't. Words help determine the world's influence on how balanced or not we feel. Might we consider a lesson from old-school biblical times, when more meaning was given to words, and we were more intentional in what we said and meant? Like they did biblically with the words right and left?

Everyone can recall what right and left means today. (Yes, sometimes I have to think about it.) They mean this side versus that side, in physical and even political terms. Those are functional but meh meanings. Biblically, right versus left was a huge deal. Huge. (Lol.) Right was super preferred and left was less like second, and more like last place. That was my take on it anyway. I vaguely recall some first-born being assigned the left seat over his younger brother who got the right. I could mash stories and say it was Cain and Able, even though I know it wasn't. Point was, those words were packed with some serious influence…deep, serious meaning.


Real magic is taking words and empowering them with deep, serious, positive meaning. They can be words that you keep to yourself, and say often to feel their vibrational power.

My friend was unable to get in touch once he arrived at the location, which is understandable.  But once he was there, I felt a complete and total disconnection - whereas I can always feel him in my Solar Plexus, now there was nothing.  Not only that, but it seemed throughout the week that I was struggling to even keep him in my memory.  It's like he ceased to exist.  I'd be at work and glance at his picture, and be like, ""Oh yeah, I forgot about him.  Weird!  Thoughts that came to mind later in the day were:  ""Have no fear, let people in, remove roadblocks.""  I also heard, ""I want to live here.""

That night I set about my meditation in preparation for astral travel.  Always when I meditate, I see scenes and/or colors in my Third Eye.  All I have been seeing is total blackness.  It's like a curtain drops and there is just nothingness.  That night I left my body 4-5 times, but have no recollection of going anywhere.  I would just wake up as I was coming back in, and then go back out.  I will say that these were the absolute easiest exits and re-entries I've ever experienced.  It just flowed.  I woke up the next morning with thoughts of past betrayals and the message that ""it doesn't matter anymore, move on.""

Two days later I was at work and getting coffee and chatting with others.  I was thinking about him and  suddenly I got very hot and felt a little woozy.  I know my coworker was joking, but she said, ""Are you on drugs?"" and I thought, ""No, but someone I know is lol.""

For the next several nights I attempted to travel.  I don't know if I did or not, I don't have any recollection of leaving but sometimes it will come back to me days later.  I even brought out my Big Gun, aka my large, heavy Selenite tower that usually causes me to launch right out of my body when I hold it.  Nothing.  Or at least no recollection.

By one week later I was starting to feel the connection coming back, ever so slightly, with the message of, ""It's time to stand up for yourself and do what you want in your life despite what others think.""

Now the next night was very interesting.  I was getting frustrated with not being able to travel/go see him as it's so easy for me, so I poured a small glass of wine and laid down on the couch.  At some point I fell asleep and when I slightly woke up, I was um...TMI...in the throes of passion, with him.  It was like we had astral sex or something.  I sat up and was like, not sure what to do with this, I mean it was nice and all but I see him as just a friend, and well, I'm married.  But anyway.  I stood up and I was very, very woozy so I sat down until it passed, then went to bed.

Several hours later I woke up and spent the next hour or so throwing up.  It was terrible.  Yeah it could have been the wine, but I drank such a small amount and I haven't thrown up from drinking in like a decade or more, and it would take way more than that anyway.  I just felt like my entire body was purging, my breathing was shallow and for a minute there I was afraid I was going to have to go to the hospital.  Very strange.  I managed to get to sleep and get up the next morning for work.  Interesting to note, I woke up with a very deep wrinkle that just suddenly appeared.  It's a smile line by my mouth and it's still there.

That's it so far.  I have no idea how long the retreat is but he will be doing some other traveling afterwards so I'm sure I will be hearing from him soon.  Maybe once he's away from the retreat it will be easier for me to travel to him so I will continue trying and update when I can.***

Time in our world is linear, I've often wondered what it would be like if it wasn't so, and I think my favourite sci fi alien madman in a box, the Doctor, puts it beautifully in this clip which I shall link below. Life really is a magician when we think of time like this.

Throughout my life Doctor Who has and always will be one of my favourite shows ever to exist. It has moments that make you cry, make you burst out laughing, have you brooding about the universe, awe, horror, and love. Not to mention incredible music and characters. One of my favourites is the concept of regeneration. For those who don't know what on earth I'm on about, regeneration is a process the Doctor goes under when he is mortally wounded, or just dying of old age, he can hold it off if he chooses as regeneration is not necessary, he can choose to die as he is. 

He originally could only regenerate 12 times, which is a full cycle, but his species granted him more when he was nearing his final incarnation. When he chooses to regenerate, his body rewrites every single cell there is, completely changing his appearance and some parts of his personality, but ultimately he is still the same. Before regeneration, the Doctor's body will glow a golden light, letting him know his time is near, or he will be in physical pain. When it actually begins, most of the time in the new series we see it as a fountain of golden energy exploding out of the Doctor, which can be quite epic, I shall also leave a link to a regeneration scene from the 10th Doctor to the 11th Doctor, so you guys can see what I mean.
https://youtu.be/_68Vyc24i1s
 (here the Doctor is dying from lethal radiation poisoning he endured to save one of his friends) 

 One thing I have noticed is when he's on his own, he is genuinely terrified as he sees regeneration as him dying and a new man being born, despite retaining all his memories, and depending on trauma. When he has a friend he is brave to the very end and doesn't have too much bad to say about changing. He is a very old alien after all so sometimes he has just wanted to stay as he is, as he can go through an identity crisis afterwards.

 The Doctor's species is Time Lord, their ability to regenerate came about from prolonged exposure to the time vortex, which is how the Doctor travels through time and space in his ship, the Tardis. Blue vortex representing travelling backwards, red is forwards.

 I find this pretty cool, I was thinking about it the other day and I thought to myself, regeneration is similar to reincarnation, as in its a new incarnation each time, a fresh experience, we don't remember our things from past lives (the Doctor has had regeneration amnesia before)  but we still keep going, enjoying this life, and we go on even after its over.  Regeneration is even similar to us changing throughout our lives. If I'm not making sense here, I shall let one of my favourite incarnations of the Doctor explain here.

""We all change, when you think about it, we're all different people all through our lives. And that's okay, that's good, you gotta keep moving. So long as you remember, all the people that you used to be. I will not forget one line of this, not one day, I swear. I will always remember, when the Doctor was me"" ❤ 11th Doctor before regenerating.

&#x200B;

Let me also state that though I believe I possess some gifts in terms of being able to analyze information in the big picture, my ""psychic"" abilities are limited in comparison to some others. With that being said, using these strategies and training your awareness is one of the best ways to make up for the lack of natural abilities that others might possess. As they say, hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard (usually).

**What is an Odds Shark?**

&#x200B;

Odds Shark is a term that is used in gambling (often times finance as well) that describes the individuals that are basically compiling all the data for an event (game, stock trade, fight, etc) and then analyzing that data in order to make a decision that involves calculated risk.

Investors will often determine conditions of a market by looking at different variables and data in order to decide when the best time to move on a decision is. In vegas, a sharp will look into the variables of the team as well as the variables of the environment and then make a decision whether to bet on said variables.

&#x200B;

an example would be say someone wants to bet on a college football game. They are going to look into variables such as the teams records, strength of schedule, style of play, injury list, weather conditions. Some even go as far as to try to figure out if any players have a lot of mental stress that might cause them to play differently, you get the picture.

&#x200B;

**Cool, but I thought manifesting wasn't about the analytical but about feeling the intangible? How does this help with my manifesting abilities?**

&#x200B;

You are correct in the sense that manifestation is about the intangible. You feeling and willing your thoughts into existence. With that being said, though some people are naturals at this, others may need more structure and physical indications of what is going on around them in order to properly react. By continuing to practice your manifestation techniques, as well as applying these methods in terms of reading energy (within you and around you) you can use the external energies to amplify your own and make your manifestation power stronger and more directed. These methods don't require heavy mathematical interpretation either. All it really requires is discipline around heightening your awareness.

&#x200B;

Every day the energies are different. That is why some days you wake up and things just fall into place and the day flows very easily. Then there are other days where it seems like nothing is going right. Often times these days there are external energies mixing with yours which can create all sorts of hectic messes in your day to day if not managed properly.

&#x200B;

**The Three main sources of energy effecting your energy field and surround energy fields:**

&#x200B;

* **Your personal energy:** This is the biggest contributor of your surroundings, which is why your thoughts and energy are the most important thing to control (and the only thing you can control). This energy can be read by using numerology.

&#x200B;

* **Cosmic Energy:** in my personal opinion this is the hardest energy to read in certain regards. people have ideas about what is coming, especially if it is very polar (good or bad waves coming) but how it effects each individual is up to the interpretation of many different people. I will discuss what to look for and how to use the information.

&#x200B;

* **Global Consciousness energy:** This is the energy of the global consciousness. This is also very difficult to put an analytical value on and relies more on intuition. The times you can experience the global conciousness is often surrounding an event that creates a lot of energy. A good example would be on christmas. a bad example would be a terrorist attack.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**How to read energy in the short term (Numerology)**

If you do not have excessive psychic abilities, in my personal opinion the best way to read energy in the short term (either internally or in your close environment) is by using numerology.

&#x200B;

Numerology essentially work by assigning a meaning to a set up numbers that you may see. If you continually see these numbers, then that message is trying to be given to you by the universe. For example you wake up in the middle of the night and see 2:22, then later you drive by the gas station and the price is 2.22 a gallon. then on your way home you you a drink at it costs 2.22.

&#x200B;

These numbers have meaning and if they are following you around they are giving indications of both your energy you are putting out, as well as when energetic gateways are opening up and your thoughts manifest quicker. The numbers will let you know when you are on the right track and when you need to readjust corse.

&#x200B;

**There are different interpretations of numerology meanings, which are correct?**

In my personal opinion it doesn't really matter which interpretations of numerology you use, just as long as the interpretations resonate with you and you stick to the same set. If you bounce around different interpretations, you will have mixed messages. however if you stick to one particular system of interpretation the message you need to hear will get to you the same. I personally use doreen virtues system of ""angel numbers"" even though i personally dismiss a lot of her work in other subjects.

&#x200B;

**Important numbers (doreen virtue interpretations)**

&#x200B;

Though you really should learn the meanings (you can also google them) here are the most important numbers to look out for:

&#x200B;

six six six (i wrote it out because i don't like seeing it lol): You need to adjust thought course to make sure you are manifesting to your highest desire. It is also important to remember not to get scared when you see this number. it is just a nudge reminder.

&#x200B;

111: This means an energetic gateway is opening and your thoughts are manifesting faster. when you see this number think about everything you want and feel what it would be like to have it.

&#x200B;

656: all is well. even though things seem to be stressful, there is divine order.

&#x200B;

333: the ascended masters walk with you and protect you.

&#x200B;

777: this means you are manifesting well and on the right track. 7 is a very positive number in numerology.

&#x200B;

by being aware of the numbers that are constantly around you you can know what type of energy you are putting out and also what may be in your surrounding environments energy. it serves as a mechanism to let you know when you need to change your thoughts or up your vibration.

&#x200B;

**Reading cosmic energy:**

&#x200B;

Reading cosmic energy is a little bit more tricky. though there are certain factors that can be easily measured, others come down to interpretation. lets first start with what we can control.

&#x200B;

**Moon cycles, eclipses, solar flares, planetary orbits, etc.**

&#x200B;

All of these types of phenomena definitely have a very large impact in terms of what type of energies are hitting the earth. Eclipses bring a massive amount of energy that a lot of times can be utilized to maximize intentions. All of these often have interpretations on what type of energy it will bring to the earth to give you an indication whether or not its a good time to set intentions and do spiritual work, or to just hunker down and wait until it passes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Astrology (and my problem with it)**

&#x200B;

Let me say that though there are definitely things in astrology i believe, there is a lot i do not believe. First and foremost I believe that your horoscope sections in popular magazines or websites (susan miller for example) are by in large BS. In order to get an accurate reading you have to have a reading built specifically on your chart, its too broad when just going sign to sign and your date and time born have a lot to do with how to interpret things.

&#x200B;

There is also a ton of different interpretations of astrology. Western astrology, eastern astrology, the argument whether or not the new zodiac sign should be included or not, when on a long timeline it just leaves too much room for inconsistencies unlike numerology; which you can test to see if the numbers are reflecting your mood. Because of this, I think there are only a few things in astrology that should be taken seriously as an indication of energy.

&#x200B;

**Anything that effects all charts**

mercury retrogarde, venus retrograde, anything that is effecting all the charts is something that should be taken into consideration on what types of energies.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**What to do with this information**

&#x200B;

With this information you will now be able to build a plan in terms of maximizing your energy output to maximize your manifestation powers. With this you will be able to track when energy gateways open, close and when ideal conditions are for meditating or doing any sort of rituals (i personally don't use rituals but its all about intent). you can also determine when energy is working with you as opposed to against you when taking calculated risks in your life (business deals, asking out a crush, etc.) You are essentially looking at things in a different way to figure out when good times to make moves are vs. when it is not a good time.

&#x200B;

Even doing the minimal amount of this will bring you an exponential change. When i first started just paying attention to the numbers around me a realized how many times my thoughts would drift away from things I wanted. By paying attention to these numbers it essentially trained my brain to identify when i was on track with manifesting what i wanted and when i wasn't on track to readjust.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Hope this helps!

Higher consciousness the way I have experienced it, is all about seeing through the illusion, being in a high vibratory state and connecting more deeply with infinite intelligence.

Seeing through the illusion was step one in the evolution of my consciousness. Taking an objective view of my entire life, my decisions, my beliefs, my traumas, my best days, my worst days. Honestly, I came to the conclusion that everything is absolutely meaningless. This may seem depressing but I would argue that it is absolutely empowering because consciousness creates meaning. A song means nothing, unless someone is conscious of this song and perceives it in a certain way. Nothing is inherently exciting, consciousness creates the excitement after having perceived something in this experience. So why not reverse engineer this? Instead of waiting for something to happen for me to feel happy, instead of having to perceive something to feel good about it. Why don't I just feel good about whatever is right here, right now? I can decide to attach whatever meaning I wish, because consciousness creates meaning. 

Being in a high vibratory state really just means feeling good. Feeling positive. This does not mean stimulating your brain with drugs or dopamine-rich activities. I am talking about the pure joy that comes from within. This is the happiness a child experiences when they run around the yard, or a baby experiences when they laugh, or a painter experiences when they are doing what they love, creating a masterpiece. The higher your vibration, the better you feel. The better you feel, the better your decisions, the more clarity you have in your life, and you are capable of literally lifting people up to your vibration. This clarity will have you laugh at the mistakes of the past, it will give you a knowing that everything will be okay, a sense of security.

Connecting more deeply with infinite intelligence or intuition or intention or the universe, whatever you call it, is the stage of conscious I am at right now. I feel more than a sense of clarity, I feel home, I am in a familiar place. This place gives me a knowing of what actions to take, what decisions to make. Actually, let me re-phrase that: Connecting more deeply with this energy, means becoming a vessel for this energy to live through you, so the right actions just happen, the right decisions just happen. When I speak, the right words are just said, it is not me saying them. When I write music, I become a vessel for this infinite intelligence to play music through. I hope this makes sense, because this has really changed my life lately.

0,ak0o5u,31,20,"So I’ve been thinking, our subconscious motives and thoughts are usually directed by entities or formless elementary powers, right?  
  
I’m not spiritually advanced, but I do believe the idea is that we are moving from Source and merging back into Source, or “oneness”.  
  
So here is my inquiry: If all creation exists within the microcosm and macrocosm of God, including lower vibrational powers, are they too on their path back to oneness?  
  
Surely nothing can exist separate from God. Yet these beings are characterised by malicious intent, malevolence, self-service and pride.  
  
Their origin is the same as ours, is that right? There cannot be two origins, all life must come from the same place and return to it.

Do they deserve compassion and liberation, in spite of their seemingly absolutely destructive and deceptive nature? Or are they perhaps part of Nature, embodying the chaotic characteristics in contrast to the benevolent ideal of order and righteousness, which can arguably be equally as destructive when taken to its extreme as well?

[Brace For Interdimensional Shift Into The New Home On A Higher Platform](https://i.redd.it/be7pdaaoqmc21.jpg)

&#x200B;

We as representatives of the Order of Seraphim offer you an incentive/powerful call to action. At the shift of ages, and the arrival of the age of Aquarius, golden age as we battle the last inner and outer demons of the Kali Yuga/age of pisces, this transition time is like no other. We are writing in connection with a Discord-platform-based group/server dubbed ""Warriors for Change"". We are looking for genuine Light Warriors to contribute to this colossal undertaking to initiate a Planetary Shift, topple dark energies on power. Engage in further communication and respond positively to this message if it piqued your interest or fascination/feel an inner calling to join us on this endeavour. I will go into further details as you could be one who appreciates technical elaborations/breakdowns and would like to learn more instantly- to make sure this is what you really wish to opt in on. (A Discord group-server and intel-hub that has no irrelevant members, negative drama or anything offtopic- if you connect to its collectively shaped and developed frequency, you will sense the streamlined Source/God Consciousness).

&#x200B;

Energy of All-that-is ""flows"" evenly, and although it does not lack direction and orientation, it sure lack momentum/intelligent complex design. 

People (light emissaries, holders), auric containers, specially arranged crystals can serve as anchor points. It is us who have to use it for the right thing, and coordinate it to be in the right place/intended etheric location at the right timing- all that, engineered in the right way that adds up, from all the intricate aspects. The modus operandi is based on/relies on superconductivity, the cyclotrone is constituted by superimposing wave structures that must not juxtapose. A potent touchdown: thunderstruck by raw cosmic energies- a normal human container would be insufficient. This takes immense preparation which you will be automatically aligned in receiving, should you choose to volunteer on this exciting transcendental adventure.

We are highly focused and streamlined. Our basic aim-quintessence is to harness all available energies to create an interdimensional rift/gate to haven that can properl us to 5th dimension and beyond, also fueled by the bowels of the earth- which constructs a beastly cyclotrone that irons out certain unwanted specific frequency-sets, diminishes their influence on the collective.I will need to meditate on each location, to properly transmit the light quotient temporarily boost multifold in each participant. Nature is a conduit, so is Ether. Then I will bathe in the lightning nebula while invoking the Ultracapacitator, the majestic all-sweeping Hybrid Titan  to distribute to different location in each fork of thunder (in layman's terms).

I personally do not have to call upon anything especially Source-energies, as I function as a direct conduit/nexus, I just have to find anchor points to synchronistically load it with, for which task we require plenty.

With the help and contribution of the various entities/gods/metaphysical high priests we listed on this endeavour. Launching sequence itself will only take place when we reach the focus of sufficient amount of light warriors, also aligned with the perihelion of the grand cosmic momentum to release this pulsewave+cyclotron- we are still in the initial but progressed gathering/recruitment phase.

""The Purpose of this site is to gather spiritual warriors.  People of exceptional spiritual strength and committment to eventually engage in one, all or nothing, attempt to defeat greed and avarice in the human experience and replace it with an attitude of Egalitarian Environmentalism.  We will discuss the exact wording of an INTENTION to defeat greed and avarice in the human consciousness, especially of the top 3% of the financial structure of this planet, and replace that sense of greed and avarice with Egalitarian Environmentalism. Our objective is basically to engineer an all-sweeping tornado that operates on a selective frequency- devouring all in its coded path.""

&#x200B;

The Intention (First Draft):  I intend that what is greedy in the human collective mind be swept away and replaced with a sense of equality toward all human beings.  I  intend that those in positions of financial power cease to consider the planet and all on it as merchandise and become aware of the interrelation of all life on this planet and mindful of the spirit of the planet, itself.  I intend that the industries of Banking, Fossil Fuel, Chemistry, Ag-Business and Pharmaceuticals cease to consider profits  above all else and devote themselves to the true betterment of humanity and the preservation of the cycle of all life.  That they become champions of Ecological commitment.

Addendum:  This intention to affect first the top financial 3% of the world all over the planet.  If greed and avarice  can not be changed in the human minds of that 3%,  that those minds be wiped clean of all cognitie ability!  As I will it, so shall it be!""

&#x200B;

""The process of this endeavor (initial version):

Each warrior will hold the single intention in your mind for 15 minutes.  During this time you will collect cosmic energy and cycle it between each of us gathering and projecting until I give the signal then we all release the energy and the intenion at one and the same moment, from wherever we are in the world.  Then we wait to see what happens.""

&#x200B;

""Banking is a completely arbitrary business based on the greed of the 1%

Ag-business has nothing at all to do with farming rationally and everything to do with putting as much mony as possible in the pockets of only a few families. ALL the food distribution in the world is in the hands of only about 7 families!

Do I even need to explain what Chemistry has done to this planet and to humans? Agent Orange. nuff said

All fossil fuels are ""liquid death"" they are made in the earth from the death and dessication of dinosaurs. And ... we DO NOT NEED THEM

The alternative could be that the radio jet is pointing almost at us.”

0,ajwpx4,6,3,"When I learned Reiki, being a dreamer, I was hoping I’d be able to channel healing to people. Mental, emotional, spiritual healing are available to all people who gain powerful new insights and adopt them, changing their way of being. None of us can dramatically change the physical; it just factually takes varying amounts of time. The closest I’ve gotten so far is that I can at least channel a good knock-off Robitussin. No kidding.

I went through some chaplain training at a hospital that wasn’t into Reiki yet. I was told not to do it at all, not to put my hands up. I don’t listen 100% ever. Yes, to the truth, always. To the gray areas...well that’s what they are there for, right? So I see a patient for prayer, who was unconscious and had terrible lung congestion that wasn’t coming up. I already had the knowing of bio-magnetic connectedness, and that people’s fields could communicate, the closer the better. So I allowed our fields to merge with my focused intention, moving the rest of me, thoughts, etc., out of the way to let the magic happen, for Universal Healing to do its trick. Within 3-4 minutes of me “praying with my head bowed,” the patient started coughing up his junk. 

I feel like some angel does that little trick for me, that little miracle, encouraging me to try and channel more physical healing. I tried physical healing with one Redditor, us both knowing it wasn’t my thing.

Hope and prayers alone, I don’t they are cutting it enough for people. And it’s not for lack of faith or prayers or God. So what’s missing?

0,ajvctz,0,4," We are products of life's conditioning. All the things we've been exposed to growing up, especially emotion-filled moments, have shaped us into who we are today. For the better, or the worse. Some are traumatized, and others are confident, some are strong, while others are weak. No two people are affected the same. But there is a way to choose what your past means, there's a way you can turn a seemingly negative thing into a positive!

  
Who you become tomorrow, has absolutely nothing to do with yesterday. The present moment is what affects tomorrow, nothing else. The past is done. Regrets, shame, guilt, self-pity... Throw those out the window, they are doing nothing but hurting you and preventing you from living the life you want to live. Now you can use the past as a learning experience, but when are you learning? NOW. So forget about what has prevented you in the past, what has held you back, what people have said, etc. Just move forward.  


When you riding in a motorboat, there are these gorgeous lines created behind the boat as you accelerate. Can these lines steer the boat? Is there any possibility? The answer is no. You steer the boat, no one else.   
You could say ""but I've been this way for so long, the past has made my present what it is and with these circumstances, I cannot change."" To this, I would say: ""you are right!"" Belief is more powerful than you'd think. If you believe you cannot change, then you can't. If you believe that everything I'm saying is bullshit, then it is. Your belief is more powerful than you even realize.  


Do not limit yourself, limiting thoughts are a result of what everyone has told you. Do not become a person who is acting from their conditioning. It's like giving the power to your enemies, your high school teachers, your parents, your co-workers, the advertisers. reclaim your life! Change is possible. You CAN get better. Happiness IS possible for you. A wonderful life is possible. Keep this in mind, and decide to act from your heart.

0,aju4wb,3,6,"I will use dream characters as an allegory.

Soo, dream characters are perceived as separated from you, you cant read their thoughts (in a ""normal"" dream), they seem totally normal and can develop extreme complexity. I once was surprised by a cashier asking me about an event I never heard of. I WAS SURPRISED BY MY OWN MIND !

That is a pretty insane phenomenon.
Comparing this to Passengers. 

A dude standing somewhere. You dont know him and the chances are high, that nobody else around knows him too. Dream characters appear as predicted, everyone would predict people in a city or so.

Manifestations/slight adaptions of the physical world (to fit the mind of the perspector and keep him believing that this is real, often accurring in dreams) are always occurring, where nobody can really prove the change. Its always there, where nobody had different thougts before. Who says, that bacteria etc. existed, before they where discovered (by people already expecting them, because they choose their instruments for that, like a microscope)

So nobody knows, if the dude in the city is real ?
You could go to him and ask him out, if he is real, he should have information, relatives, ...

But if you do so, you focus extremely on him and your subconsciousness may easily make everything up on its own. And also, whats with all the other people around, that you dont inspect ? They could be ""fake"" too !

And there is no solution. If you ask everyone, you would either need more people(->more subconsciousness'es) or more time (so you could imagine one after another).

And on my stand, we stay in this situation, that we just dont know...

But, yesterday morning i woke up horrified. 

i slept well and sound up to 3am that one night. then i woke up and could not fall asleep until 4.30 again, with a feeling i’d go lucid which i did not want - knowing something was weird. I was tired, cloudy, and confused.

0,ajt42u,26,115,"Today I had a really fantastic realization, one that has given me peace after about 10 years of this issue totally confounding me. This is my first post here. 

I feel like I was always an old soul. As a kid, I would go on rants about big ideas and people would always joke ""cactusflowers has her soapbox out again!"" I was always very concerned with kindness and moral issues, but people always criticized me as being a ""downer"". Nobody wanted to listen to the things that mattered. At some point when I was younger, after my true self had been criticized a lot, I started thinking ""maybe I should just be like everyone else; maybe then I'll be accepted."" I don't feel guilty with myself for this, I was young and didn't know how to deal with loneliness. 

So, I stopped sharing my ideas because people told me I was crazy. I started drinking heavily because thats how so many in our society deal with things. I started trying to be the sexiest sex kitten because those were the women who got noticed. I stopped being honest about what I need in relationships because I was told that would scare people off. Basically, the world around me seemed like a cold heartless place where having feelings and emotions and caring about anything was the UNCOOLEST of all social crimes. The only things that mattered were how many people you could screw, how ""hot"" you could look, and how socially acceptably exciting you could make your life appear to be. 

So I tried doing all those things for awhile, but it was literally only because I was afraid to be my true self. I kept attracting the most dishonest, manipulative people who would pretend to be one way at first, but then eventually their masks would come off and show their true colors which weren't ones that I liked. It didn't make sense to me because I hadn't been EXPLICITLY telling lies to anyone, so I couldn't understand why I kept getting deceived. At that time, I didn't notice how inauthentic I was being as a whole.

Today I made sense of all this. I think it's because I was so afraid to stand in my own truth, so I was attracting people who were equally as uncomfortable standing in their own truth. They were hiding their true selves out of fear, just like I was. (This is why I love shadow work. ❤❤ dem mirrors.) I take responsibility for my errors but I don't blame myself entirely - I had a ton of social conditioning/brainwashing to undo.

So all this to say... if you're hesitating to be your true self because you're afraid it won't be accepted, and you find yourself attracting inauthentic people... Maybe this will help you shed some light on those things. ❤ I just wanted to share this perspective in case anyone else might be dealing with something similar.",new,"I had a realization about authenticity, and how that ties into the people you attract.",115

shining green in all of glory

their rising on the wheel of Time hath made manifest might and grand.

I lie here in the crevice of some ancient deity's hand

My sins and fears flow away with the river

...

Between these mighty peaks I gather myself

all the loose ends pulled tight and wiped clean.

With a rhythmic breath, my heart are rest, I meditate.

I resonate.

From my atoms to my attitude I vibe high and free

thinking I'm bonding, feeling some sort of correspondence,

with this mountain in front of me

Then, Deeply,

""Speak to me. You now know the frequency.

I indeed am alive and I welcome you peacefully

This Valley is mine and I gift you your piece of it.""

""You've washed your sins, now wash your mind,

wrought clean by the hands of your Will

and with our Wills together, we'll make Time stand still

Resonate.

let me teach you.

When the winds cease to breathe through,

the Valleys inside uncluttered and equal...""

""That is where I will meet you.""

From the Earth to my Mind to the Peaks to the Sky,

these vibrations flow uniformly.

These vibrations don't ask why how or, what came before we,

just resonate.

...

As I close my eyes, relax my mind,

and pierce the point where time meets space and space meets time,

a reflection of the peaks in the sky,

gleams in my eye as it glistens inside.

This Mountain may never know the crash of a mighty wave,

but this Mountain knows how to make one.

Awash in the grand might made manifest,

Fears days are done, absent like the tick of the clock

in this moment.

...

The sun and the moon, within and without

align amidst the stars.

I am the mountain, this mountain is me,

this Valley is us, this Valley is ours

...

To resonate is to extend yourself,

to become one with some great truth.

A soul or a thought or a book on your shelf,

will more than do.

I have Resonated with this Mountain, and now we resonate with You.

0,ajpmmp,40,41,"I tried posting this before but it wouldn't work so I copied and pasted my text. 

When I was a really little kid, we're talking single digits, I was laying in bed. This was probably around 1986 or so. I had the top bunk bed and I was afraid of sleeping because I had night terrors and nightmare episodes that I couldn't wake up from. I noticed lights outside. So I looked outside and I saw that the house diagonal to mine (we lived on the corner) had all of these multicolored lights swirling around. After that I woke up the next morning. 

Cut to 1996, I was on a trip in Europe for high school musicians called American Music Abroad. I was staying with a Dutch family in the town of Heesch. The family was so lovely. The oldest brother was dating this woman named Natasja who I now know was a shaman. I think she referred to herself as a mystic. Well she told me that I had twice been visited by grey aliens. And she referred to a mark on my body that I was not born with, and it's true, I do have a mark like this. She said that they were interested in me because I have many talents. And it's true, I am a multidisciplinarian. She also said that her spirit guide taught her to do what I now know is Tai Chi. 

This has freaked me out to no end. I don't like the idea of aliens at all. I saw ""Communion"" when I was a kid, and ""Fire in the Sky,"" and ""The X-Files,"" all of these things came out when I was a teenager, and I was like NOPE. 

The fear has come up from time to time. When I moved to the city, part of me was like, ""Good. Less chance of being abducted."" 

However, five days ago in my shamanic journeying, I realized that there is a part of my brain that is conspicuously ""dark."" Almost like there's a sign up that says, ""Nothing to see here! Move along, now!"" 

So I asked this part of my brain, ""Starseed?"" (A word I've heard on this sub and I'm not sure if it was right.) I said, ""It's okay if you are aliens."" And I saw a door open, and light shine from that room, a figure quickly went in without even opening the door all the way, and then the door closed again. 


I'm wondering if this is abduction stuff? Or if through fear I am not glimpsing the things that people talk about on here. Like Pleiadians and stuff? Can anyone direct me in a helpful, well, direction? Much love and thanks in advance. ",new,Help! I am scared of aliens,41

0,ajlsgw,0,3,"First, I know life itself can be seen as magic, as well as many other more common occurrences; but, it happens other ways too. In thinking about that, two experiences instantly pop into my mind. If you believe in magic, I hope these reinforce things for you:

One. During the time of dial-up-modems, I remember my max modem speed was like 2-3 mbs? Or was it even kbs? Either way, it usually ran about 1.5, and never above 3. I had just finished working on a year-long project, was going online to send it to someone, and I remember focusing on the modem speed. I needed more reassurances back then—that I was in the flow, on the right path, etc.—so I said in my head, ""Please. Let me know. Show me an 8!"" Within about 10 seconds, the number jumped up to 8.something, then back down to 1.5. To me, that was magic!

Two. I wish I could remember who gets credit for turning me on to *Autobiography Of A Yogi*; a book I read twice in a row during a time when I'd often state that I didn’t read books anymore. I believed absolutely every word in that book. Full-on faith. Even parts where his mom's praying and an item appears in her hand as a gift from a divine spirit. Within a week of re-reading the book, I was sewing on a machine, a simple straight line, to turn a piece of navy blue cloth into a drape for my garage widow.

Sewing machines have two thread sources: one  above that’s visible, and one below that’s hidden. I’m part-German, very-particular about certain things, and so the top and the bottom threads were the same exact color as the new drape. Soon as I finished sewing, I went to change both threads to a lighter blue to sew some jeans, and that’s when I saw the thread source below (the bobbin) had green thread?!!

I rechecked the drape, expecting to see green thread sewn into it underneath. Nope…navy blue. I instantly knew the green thread had appeared there to show me that what I believed was indeed real; that things could appear, that magic happens!

Oh, Three. And I just now remembered, that in that moment, I asked for guidance further along into the reality that I knew was hiding behind everything. The one where the magic comes from. Within a one minute online search, I was led to the path I’m on now, that starts with a still mind, and connecting with spirits/energies that can show you the way from here. Amazing!

*.  I notice that the commonality of these things is stuff happening from literally behind the scenes. The modem didn’t change color, but from the hidden, inner-workings, the speed number changed. The top, visible spool didn’t change, the bottom hidden one did. And why in all my previous searches in my thirst for spiritual knowledge, had this one, from the invisible, given me a brand new, life-changing result? There’s something to all that, and I think things appearing from the unseen act as training-wheels to lead us to things happening literally right before our eyes. But only if you believe, or more likely, know, magic happens.",new,Magic Happens,3
0,ajlani,11,13,"I felt like I was in a grey fog, I couldn't make sense of my own desires. I didn't really know what I actually wanted for myself. I struggled deeply with setting intentions with meditation and law of attraction because I couldn't figure out what it was that I actually wanted in my life or what I was doing... But it just hit me, and I remember it all now, why I even wanted to learn the powers of meditation and magick.

I want to be a traveler, a wanderer, an adventurer. No home, no money, no attachments. Just me and the whole world open to me. If it were possible for me to jump through time and space, I would wander the multiverse. If it were possible for aliens to take me away and show me the wonders of space and all the planets, I would accept and abandon the earth.

&nbsp;

I saw the powers of Buddhists, Hindus, and Shamans are their great intuitions that guided and helped them. I wanted the powers of intuition so I could know where to find water, or what plants were good to eat and what were not good. I want to able to survive in any environment with nothing but the powers and intuition of my mind. No money, No special tools. Just me.

Then I started looking at Magick, Law of Attraction, and Dimension Jumping. I saw these as powerful tools, but I had forgotten why I even became interested in them in the first place. If these powers are real and can be learned, they open up a whole new door of possibilities for me. I don't want power, money, the perfect job, a relationship. None of this means anything to me. I want to travel. I want to fly. I want to see other worlds. I want to be boundless.

&nbsp;

I don't want to worry about things like food, water, money, clothing. If I can learn to raise my intuition or learn the powers of magick to eliminate these problems and to take me further along my travels, then that's what I want. That's my goal. That's my intention. It's all so clear to me now, why I've been doing all of this, why I've even been trying to learn this stuff. I couldn't properly set my intention because I didn't know what I was actually trying to accomplish.

0,ajjdns,8,10,"I'm usually able to keep my cool and stay true to myself, but the recent days I had some time with my father and he told me what he really thinks, and it was much more difficult to hear than I thought. He basically thinks I have been corrupted by the Devil, that what I do is against God (I'd say it's the exact opposite hah, more on that later.) What is the most difficult in that is seeing someone you love in complete devotion to a system based on lies made to control people through fear. And I can explain it to him in 100 different ways, the roots of the belief is way too deep at this point, it seems. I even use actual bible verses to prove what I say, but he says I cannot hand-pick verses like that. He has never read the bible... And yet I point this irony and his answers is always ''This is why faith is important...'' 

My goal is to make as many people happy as I can, and aparently this is the work of the devil... I know it doesn't make sense, but I'm so close to my father and love him so much it is really difficult to hear such a level of non-understanding of what I am going through. And at the same time he points to all my faults, which I am well aware of, as proof that what I do isn't working. I am not perfect, I'm on my journey and there are highs and lows. Recently it's been more low than high as I've completed a cycle and am now starting a new one. The first one was everything related to DMT, Ayahuasca, that finished in an LSD trip, the 2nd cycle was primarily with Ibog, and I became a provider of this medicine and also researched the ehck out of the human body and how to be healthy. I have not applied all I researched, and this is 100% my fault. The 3rd cycle is going to be energy healing and actually staying true to what I know is true about who I am. I'm starting this with no money, unlike the previous 2 cycles, because of a bunch of things that happened including frauds. So my dad sees me as wasting all my time with fake gurus who just wants my money, wasting my time not having a girlfriend, not having a car, not having a career, not having a real, tangible plan. And he wants to ''make me realize that life is not about all those ''funky, wacky'' stuff you are doing in the realm of demons.''

I have been saying to a lot of people to care not to care, and right now more than ever I need to apply this for myself as I know I cannot let other people affect me like that on my path. The experiences I have had I know are true, no one can deny that. No one else went through what I've been trhrough. And that can be said for everyone... But ultimately, I know there will be a point where he will understand, as he is sonmeone who believes once he sees, and I know one day I will have something to show. But then again, I'm not making this my goal as some sort of competition. But deep down i know it will happen eventually. So I just need to NOT GIVE UP. Funny how I started writing this for everyone to help and turns out I answered all my questions as I was typing haha! 

I recently had the most intense experience of my life, upon the completion of the 2nd cycle, in which I felt the love of God, and that instant in which I felt the immensity of the love I just exploded in tears, my heart was vibrating like crazy, and my whole body started shivering. I was ecstatic. It was such an incredible experience, a perfect reminder that love is really at the root of all this experience we call life. But my father completly denied what happened and brushed it off as a delusion. I think this is what hurt me the most. I had the most pure example of love and it was instantly brushed off. Thank you Soulnexus for giving me access to a platform I can write like this and figure things out as I write them haha!

Now the thing I also want to focus at the moment is finding my tribe, and having local people who are interested in learning more about life also. I need to share this love with people who want to receive it. The more the merrier, and yet I have not met a single soul locally who is as passionate as I am towards life and towards knowing. It will happen though.

0,ajjb1y,34,5,"This might be a bit long but I'll include a TL:DR. Thank you for reading either 🙏

I turned 30 in July 2018 and two years before that my first male partner (I had only previously dated women) & second serious/long-term relationship broke up with me. We dated for about 3 years, 2 of which we lived together. The breakup was largely due to me going vegan. 

When I met J, I was HUGELY into extreme metal (thrash, black, death metal, etc.), drank alcohol, ran around in mosh pits, wore all black clothing 99% of the time, etc. That's how we met, actually. I went to one of his band's shows. He started talking to me that night & as corny as it may sound, from the first moment I looked into his eyes, I knew he wasn't just a random guy. It felt like I had known him before. We hit it off right away & haven't stopped talking since that summer in 2013 till now.

However, in 2015, I had knee surgery & my doctor asked that I stop taking my birth control pills due to blood clot risk. I had never considered that as a serious risk & actually didn't do much research before going to Planned Parenthood for the Pill.  J had simply suggested it one day saying ""you should maybe get on the pill"" and reassured me all his past girlfriends were on it and were fine. I scheduled the appointment right away without doubting it & was on the Pill shortly after.

However, that same year in 2015, J. decided to go vegetarian for ~3 months for weight loss/health reasons and since I had been vegetarian for 6+ years before meeting him, I decided I wanted to do the challenge with him but go a step further since I had already been vegetarian & that was easy for me. I decided to try vegan. 

As I began to research food ideas, I started coming across so much information about the detrimental impact animal agriculture has on the planet, the animals, our health, etc. I spent the next 3 weeks recovering from knee surgery at home & watching so many documentaries & crying my eyes out. I knew then that I was vegan for good.

And that's where we slowly started growing apart. I became a ""radical"" animal rights activist (not anymore in the same sense). I was angry & hurt at how much destruction & suffering humans were/are causing. I joined an AR group with many angry/upset vegans & felt so welcomed & validated/understood. However, one winter day in December 2016, I heard a ""voice"" tell me to meditate as I was sitting in my living room, feeling overwhelmed with anger, depression, anxiety. I started meditating every day since that day and my life transformed in the best way.

I felt like I was moving from a quite literal darkness to light. As fortune would have it, I was making too big of changes too fast and J. broke up with me a second time. This time I moved out of our apartment. I left him Thich Nhat Hanh's The Miracle of Mindfulness and asked if he could please read it. I came back 2 weeks later to get more of my things, and found that he was actually reading the book, was sober, meditating, microdosing mushrooms. I was very surprised.

Eventually, I invited him to come try a Kundalini yoga class with me and he did. That was in 2017. We're both still practicing there and he even has become a Kundalini Yoga teacher. However, he still eats meat and although he doesn't drink half a bottle of tequila on weeknights anymore, he still drinks & goes to metal shows. I am trying to stay sober & still listen to some metal but mostly stay away from the kind with very violent lyrics (although musically I still enjoy it from time to time).

We've officially been broken up about a year, but we still love each other very much. We recently had sex and I started crying after because something told me that as much as I love him, we are just at different parts of our journey. I would love nothing more than to get back together, but a part of me is not sure if I can be around meat anymore. I also worry about any potential impact his diet (food, movie, alcohol consumption, etc.) may have on my energy body & such (is that silly?). He recently invited me to go on an adventure & live out of a van with him as we explore state parks, climb mountains, hike, etc. And my heart was leaping, screaming ""YES, I WANT THAT SOOO MUCH!!!"" but then I also heard a faint, ""..but if we don't work out? What if our lifestyles will lead us in opposite directions?""

Additionally, I also started dating another Kundalini yoga instructor who is the complete opposite to J. He is vegan, doesn't really drink alcohol (except for wine once or twice a year), is super devoted to his practice, practices semen retention, encourages me to treat all of me with love & compassion, treats me like a Goddess/Queen. Everything that I was hoping J. would embody in a lot of ways, and yet, I still feel very attracted to J. Something about him still being a ""bad boy"", something about him not being completely ""pure"", and also the fact that he, too, is a super sweetheart, kind person & an amazing friend. I also feel that he is human & isn't perfect, just like me. I know he is deserving of compassion just like every other animal regardless of whether he knowingly chooses to support violence against the animals & the Earth or not.

I feel like I am literally choosing between light & dark. I know J. can change and he has A LOT already, but I also know he wants me to go into this 100% without a doubt & accepting him regardless of how he chooses to live his life. And he wants me to be happy no matter if it's with him or not. I love him so much for that. I want the same for him too.

If you've read this far, thank you so much! I just needed to get this off my chest & perhaps the Universe (within/without)/my spirit guides can send a little guidance my way here...

TL;DR I am torn between going back with my ex-fiancé, J., of 3 years who still eats meat, drinks alcohol, etc (although he's now a Kundalini yogini) or a vegan yogini who is pretty much the complete opposite to J. How do I know when it's time to let go, move on, or stay single? So confused & heartbroken.

Thank you 🙏

This is a simulation that is changed by altering your projected reality, which equals the sum total of your awareness. Awareness of breath is awareness of body, which becomes control of the body and mind, which forms the basis of your projected reality, starting with self awareness.

 If you're being blocked it might be you're not ready for what you're trying to do, or it requires a different approach. If we're in a spiritual war, then it's a battle of wills, strength of will directly correlates to the degree of control you have over your mind, which can only be fully developed through the breath. 

The basis behind manifestation of anything into reality is spiritual energy/prana/chi/etc. Think of chi as money, and yoga/meditations as ways to earn money on your own time. What/who you think about/give attention to is what you spend/invest your money in. The more you work for chi, and the less you needlessly spend chi, builds a greater reserve of chi/money/capital for you to spend at your discretion. So you have these ideas you want to bring into flesh, you need to work for the energy that is necessary for its fruition, especially when they are new ideas, they require more energy/funding. 

Spirit is prana, it's life force and the breath, and it couples the soul to the body, which is why the body rots and the soul departs at death, the spiritual energy is no longer coherent and becomes potential energy.

My higher self agrees with my friend.

Maybe there is a logical explanation for this but wonder if it’s starting to happen more to others too?

Oddly I was rereading the Dolores Cannon book  this morning where she says:

""“Our bodies and everything around us are now increasing their vibratory rate and adjusting to a new frequency. Every cell of the body begins to vibrate at such a fast rate that it turns into light. When this begins, the temperature of the body increases and the body starts to glow with light. When every cell is vibrating at a very high rate, you will disappear from normal vision and move into a higher dimensional reality. This is because the body has moved in vibration beyond the third dimension and is now vibrating on a much higher dimensional level."" from ""The Three Waves of Volunteers and the New Earth"" by Dolores Cannon

Balance is a very useful concept to keep in mind as we grow in becoming our greatest versions. ""Balance"" the way I describe it here is simply living in harmony with your authentic self, higher self, spirit, soul. Whatever name we give this thing. Balance is living your life genuinely. Have you ever felt guilty? For a moment you were out of alignment with who you know yourself to be, with your values and morals, and so you felt guilt or shame. 

Many times, negative emotions like guilt, shame, fear, anger, anxiety, stress or depression are warning signs. Obvious signals that whatever is going on, the way you are behaving, the environment you're in, is out of alignment with who you truly are. When we feel happy, joyful, in love, at peace and excited, these are signals that you are living more in alignment with your authentic self. Keep in mind, I am not saying that overindulgence in drugs or stimulation of any kind is alignment, feeling happy at others expense is not either. When you learn to stay present with your mind and body, you will understand the difference between a heart's desire and minds or bodies desire.

This isn't to say you won't slip up, I sure do quite often. But it is important that we get back on our feet, learn from our trials and tribulations and keep moving forward. Every slip up is key in your evolution here. When someone falls off their bike or strip when they are just learning how to walk, this is always a part of learning. Your body will rebalance itself and learn from that mistake. 

So you might find yourself overeating, overindulging in TV, video games, drugs or alcohol. just be present with how you feel. Think about what excites you in life, are these actions serving your higher purpose? Do you feel any bit of guilt or shame about these things? Take steps each day to getting better. Just remember the balance, a drink isn't so bad every now and then. Watching a movie is great and fun! Even reading and working out are lovely. But too much of any of these things can really throw you off track. 

Remember, everyone's balance is different. There are people who work 12 hours a day, I myself work about 5 or 6 and I am comfortable with that. People might even think that my idea of balance is totally wrong, that's absolutely fine, this is what works for me. Find what works for you.

I have been personally guided to start creating my own Soul Family mandala. This process has been accelerated since January 1st, 2019, under the guidance of the Pleiadian star fleet commander Semjase, who is actually one of the Soulmates that belongs to my Soul Family mandala

The Pleiadian fleet is preparing my female Soulmates and female members of my Soul Family on the surface of the planet for this project, by sending them strong revelatory dreams, visions and synchronicities that will prepare them for contact with me. These strong spiritual experiences have started for them already since the release of Contact Dish protocols in March 2018, but have intensified since the start of 2019.

We will be creating a Bubble of Heaven, anchoring true Goddess mysteries and will go through accelerated Ascension process.

0,aj9tqm,9,13,"Lately when I think about being late, or when I'm checking the clock to see what time it is, I get this peculiar thought that I exist out of time.

It has happened a few times now, and when it does I always think it as ""We exist out of time"" like something is speaking to me.

As I dive further into this spiritual world, more surfaces in front of me that I can not percieve. My answers are guided into questions, my hunger for knowledge is satiated for a time, and again unleashed for a time. The light I am given created the darkness around me. Much brighter than I could have ever imagined.

0,aj8ryi,15,18,"I can only imagine the first time I heard someone say, “We are all connected.” During this lifetime so far, I’ve gone from a non-self-aware, imbalanced, chaotic mess to a self-aware, balanced, mostly peaceful person. I’m sure the first time I heard the concept of universal connectivity, I thought, “Aw. That’s nice,” but can’t say I truly understood it, or even believed it, definitely didn’t experience it, and didn’t know how such a thing was even possible; but…I do now.

The understanding came first with learning more about our bio-magnetic fields. Scientifically, factually, the little electric currents within us emanate interactive magnetic fields. These fields extend out infinitely, criss-crossing each other, connecting us all. Gravity is another field that does the same, doubly connecting us. The quantum field, triply, and so on for all the fields we don’t even know about yet. So we’re not just kind-of connected; we are intertwined. 

An experience came soon after the full understanding. Very early one morning, I was connected with the spirit of my meditation tree, Doc. My mind was still and my consciousness was in my heart. I started “thinking” about a girl I knew way down in Florida who was going through some troubles and I was wanting to send her good vibes. That’s when I felt her heart with my heart, or more exactly, the emanations from my heart merging with and connecting with the emanations from hers. I was so much in awe, I noted the time. It was around 4:30am. Later, I was very pleased and encouraged to learn the girl had woken up randomly at around 4:30am to “odd” sensations.

As much as I do understand and experience these days, I take zero credit for the ability to tune into a specific vibration, especially with infinite ones intersecting and connecting us all. There is some divine, old-school spiritual operator that makes the connection for me. And I am grateful and hopeful to meet them in the near future, so I can give them a proper hug. (I already hug Doc, so it’d be cool if it was somehow him.)",new,“We Are All Connected”,18
0,aj5oqi,5,6,"So the other day I had an extremely intense experience.


The story begins a week ago when I was outside in the hot summer sun, writing my 3x33 prayers and 5x55 manifestations in my magickal notebook. For maybe a 15 minute stretch I was shirtless to soak up some rays.


Naturally, given my skintone, this got me pretty sunburned. But it wasn't so bad, I didn't have any trouble sleeping or anything like that.


Then three days ago it happened, the fuzzy warm sensation I had gotten used to transformed into a repeating crescendo of incredibly painful needles.


I have a tattoo of the seed of life on my chest, and a part of it is over the bone plate, which was very painful, but I could handle it.


This pain had me out of control. I was air screaming (without letting the vocal cords vibrate), writhing and squirming on my back over a scratchy blanket, and jolting around the room frantically, attempting to apply pressure to my whole back at once.


3 applications of my housemates “Soothing Aloe Cream” offered no relief. And it took ages to get my shirt off, because I kept reflexively slapping my back again before I could complete the motion.


I found partial relief by standing half in the shower with my back under a constant stream of cold water (the heater here only lasts a couple minutes).  The temp dips into the 50s at night but the cold and wet was so much more preferable.


After ~20 minutes I felt too guilty about the water consumption so I got dry and hoped the sensations would remain low.


They didn't, and I was back in another loop of writhing and scratching and slapping, until I got a message, a little telepathic insight, that this wouldn't end until I sat down at my altar and meditated through it.


So that's exactly what I did, I sat down at the altar, began to say a mantra rapidly, and focused my gaze on a sacred geometry painting in front of me. (There was too much adrenaline in my system for any type of mindfulness meditation).


For what felt like an eternity but was probably 5 minutes, I was air screaming and contorting my body but I did. not. scratch. and it took all of my willpower to do so.


Eventually, I began to attempt to “transmute” these sensations of pain into a positive feeling. I have always hypothesized that this is what Jesus did on the cross, that his last moments were in intense ecstasy and he transcended the matrix just before the death of his physical body. (Not to compare the two situations, that would be absurd, just explaining where I got the ideas).


So it actually worked! I never got to the point where I was feeling pleasure but I definitely got to the point where I was feeling “intense pressure” instead of “intense pain”, and I became filled with gratitude for the experience.


Around the 30 minute mark, the sensation subsided significantly. I was giving thanks to God and my gurus and my spirit guides (you betcha I was praying to them earlier for help) when I had a little telepathic insight:


I passed the test, and as above so below, the transmutation of the pain was reflective and symbolic of the transmuting of my DNA to higher levels of activation.


It was incredible to receive such a strong signal for something I've been expecting to happen for a while (DNA evolution), it was super intense and hopefully washed some of my karma as well.


Thanks for reading!


Love vibes,


Timothy

Once you understand chakras/seals/discs...the many names and understand them, you can see how the whole world is living in the first 3 chakras.  

When men are born they are in the first chakra (red - ego, stability, courage), 

Women are naturally in the second chakra (orange, action, creation).  

All physical symptoms occur under the 4th chakra (green, love, union).  

The average of all people are are in between the 3 and 4th chakra.  

Most people reach the 4th chakra when they see their child being born.  But then they fall back to the 3rd chakra.  

Once we reach the 5th chakra (blue, truth, honesty) we can reach and find our destiny.  

The 6th chakra (black, intuition, reflection, clairvoyance) is christ consciousness.  

The 7th (purple) is enlightenment and above (8-9 chakras) is when you gain celestial knowledge and leave this reality.

I have been initiated in ancient schools and am learning the science of reality from ascended masters.  This information is so simple it gets convoluted and so I wanted to share to help people understand this simple but powerful knowledge.  Ascension is lifting your consciousness through these chakras which then release hormones.  It's a science and can be proven in these schools.  I wanted to share with you all so we can help each other understand energy and have more compassion for people when you notice them in certain levels.  It becomes helpful in creating a more lucid reality and empowering wisdom.  

If you have any additional info, I'd love to hear.  Hope you all are having a wonderful week!

0,aj2739,77,13,"This random thought came to me the other night, as I was thinking about many of the illusions, constructs, and conditionings of the Matrix that we have been force-fed as an enslaved human race. 

In the beginning, they say - that God created Adam and Eve. They walked around the Garden of Eden all jolly, and naked, naming the animals, and living in absolute perfection. 

And then one day, a fallen angel named Lucifer/Statan, decided that he didn't want to play God's game anymore, and that he wanted to do his own thing, aka the first being to succumb to ""Ego."" So he moseyed his ass on down to earth, found Eve in the garden, shape shifted into a serpent, and let her know that if she opened her eyes, she could be like God. 

Now, I'm pretty sure the thoughts that went through her head were like, wordddd! I could be like that thunderous voice that I hear from this sky, telling me to help Adams lazy ass, and naming all these animals, and everything else that I have to do? Sign me up! 

So Satan led her to the tree of knowledge, of good and bad - Knowing damn well that, that was the one tree that God told Adam and Eve they could not touch (petty,) and proceeded to let her know that if she ate this, she would be just like God. Of course she didn't want to go down alone, so she talked Adam into it, he fell for the scheme, and now BOOM, a lower frequency was born, they immediately became imperfect, Eve started getting PMS, cramps, and that b**** Aunt Flow started visiting...And then they began their incestuous family. 

So I look at this whole story, and I backtrack. So Christianity tells us, about this God who is supposed to be Almighty, omnipresent, all powerful, full of unconditional love - the creator of all things...fell into a hissy fit because someone who he could have easily destroyed, decided to show him who's balls were bigger - and question his sovereignty. (And yes I'm using the word ""balls"", because they conditioned us to Orient God as a MALE/DIVINE MASCULINE) So butthurt God, decided to say - okay wise guy, since you want to f*** with my enslaved couple, let's put Humanity to a test, and see if they can survive, prosper, and do well without me, the head honcho, big dawg, BOSS, God. So I'm going to make them feel pain, and suffer through old age and sickness, make sure I switch up all the languages soon as there's enough people on the Earth so nobody can communicate, and divide from one another, and create the perception of shame/guilt, punishment, smallness, and lack among Humanity... Just so I can prove to b**** ass Lucifer, that his balls aint bigger than mine. 

So obviously my commentary is purposely comedic, however, the point that I'm truly trying to get across - is where was the LIE? Satan told Eve that she could be like God. If the truth is, that we are embodiments of God/Source/the Universe, and we make up one whole, through unity consciousness, then technically we are God. God is within us. We are individually co-creators. So basically that is what Satan was trying to say. If you ask me, don't shoot the messenger! 

At the end of the day Satan is a scapegoat of a figure, when there are more than just one non benevolent ET, and other dark forces that have joined together to keep us in this Matrix prism that we have been in since the start of our humanoid creation. 

Long story short, growing up as a Jehovah's Witness, one of the things that initially started to unchain me from the organization, is that if God is All About Love, and is all-powerful, then he of all people would not fall to Ego, by allowing his own creation to suffer all this long, Just to settle a score. Does this biblical God have a polarity that allows good and bad to exist in one frequency? A dualistic God/Source/creator goes against the whole reason we are ascending to a higher plane, where duality ultimately ceases to exist. 

My two Cents.",new,What if Satan the devil was simply telling the TRUTH!?,13
0,aj1y0o,3,6,"There is a powerful, passionate, excited, high energy being within, banging at the walls, ready to express itself. Ready to fulfill a dharma, a purpose, a mission. This is the higher self, or the authentic self, the spirit or soul. Whatever you call it, this is who you really are. This is what we have all forgotten due to the human experience.

There is also, in my experience, an energy of absolute supportiveness, love, well-being, and light constantly flowing through you. Only we are in resistance, either physically, mentally or emotionally to this flow. Briefly, I will mention how I am currently releasing my resistance, and what his flow state is like for me.

Going with the flow for me is living my purpose, living the most exciting life, effortlessly. For me, I find excitement in learning, in teaching, in creating art or music, in traveling, and an appreciation for beauty everywhere. When I release all the things I do that's holding me back from this, it becomes as natural as breathing. I speak on camera and the words simply flow. I write like this and the typing just happens. Next thing you know I have a song, or a piece of art, or a video, or a post. It is life not only on my terms, but an unfolding far greater than I could have even asked for. 

**1 - Meditate each morning.**

This allows me to quickly detach from identifying with my ego and living from a state of presence. It silences the mind and leaves room for your authentic self to express. Without identification, the ego fades into nothingness. By ego, I mean the constant stream of thoughts and desires that hold you back from finding true happiness and fulfillment.

**2 - Do not try.**

I allow every action I take to unfold effortlessly. If I do not feel like exercising, I know that a time will come when nothing can keep me from exercising. In other words, I am present enough to know that deep down, exercising is something that I will do. But if not done at the right moment, I might not be as effective. Like I only write music when I am inspired to do so. Inspiration is another word for this flow. So do what inspires you at this moment. it might just be having tea and reading a book, or going for a walk. If you've done step one, then you will be able to notice whether or not the action you are about to take stems from ego or authentic self. 

&#x200B;

The spiritual path, and all personal development for that matter, is a process. Do not put any unnecessary pressure on yourself to figure things out right away. This life is about the journey, not the destination. Would you listen to a song for the note? Would you watch a movie to only see the climax? Would you eat all the food you will ever eat right now? Let the process unfold. Trust that you are exactly where you are supposed to be, doing exactly what you are supposed to do.

&#x200B;

Hope this helps in some way as these things have changed my life. If you have any other suggestions or stories. I would love to hear them. Thanks everyone!

0,aj1vzm,3,9,"So one of my intentions a bit ago was to delve deeper into self-love by exploring self forgiveness. It was like retrograde season or something with all the little flub-ups I was making, with no reason to. For example, I've got strong intuition and a sense of direction and I felt I was walking the right way toward an event but I wasn't... I ate some nasty pizza right before going to bed because I was hungry, even though it was super late and it would've been wiser to just sleep, wake up and eat. The point wasn't to avoid the unhealthy habit (even though, I literally did the same thing the night before); the point was to integrate, accept, and love the inefficient parts of me too. In the end, for me it's just nipping things in the bud so I don't have to declutter them later :) Ask to manifest something and you will be given the opportunity to practice what you are wanting to become.

I recently responded to a post in a Facebook lightworkers page where somebody raised an eyebrow about how she thought the healing services in the group was supposed to be free. It clearly ruffled a bunch of people's feathers, and she received major backlash for requesting free healing. 

I responded, by letting her know that Soul Tribe network is an organization that is shifting the Paradigm, from one of spiritual capitalism, to one of unity, and helping one another for free, or equal exchange. (And not exactly monetarily)

My comment was deleted immediately, which caused me to raise an eyebrow about whether or not I should be contributing to the group... And then I realized, that people obviously may not be too happy about a nonprofit social media Network that provides free healing globally.

Many lightworkers rely on using their gift, to make a living, and I must say that I have struggled with this concept for a very long time.  In this community, it seems like the ""pay what you're worth,"" idea has been rigged into our hearts and minds. The way I look at it, Jesus didn't go around healing people, and then asking them for their PayPal, venmo, cash app, or daenery, ducketts, or whatever kind of biblical currency existed back then. Lol, my point being - and I'm not afraid to say it, I believe charging for healing is a construct of 3D. 

This is why one of the biggest foundations of STN will be free healing for anyone in need globally. The services that we will provide are as follows:

Oracle Readings
Twin Flame Readings
Pendulum Divination

0,aj0eq3,25,4,"Hey again, after the relative success of my last thread https://www.reddit.com/r/Soulnexus/comments/ah6h0p/an_astrology_game_involving_symbolic_degrees_open/ in which 3/3 people were able to correctly identify a symbolic/metaphorical description of themselves based on the degree data of their astrology natal charts, I'm back with a new proposition! 

While an individual's natal chart is a sort of roadmap to, or blueprint describing, *this life*, it is said that the Draconic chart (a chart based on the fixed position of the North and South Lunar Nodes - the dragon's head and tail of a chart) represents the fundamental undercurrent of the Soul of an individual. I've tested people's abilities (both Reddit users, 4chan users, and my own friends and family members) to identify their own natal charts and they have tested at about 80-100% accuracy, universally beating chance by a factor of several multiples! 

If you wish to participate please go here: https://www.astro.com/

>Select Free Horoscopes 

>Select Extended Chart Selection 

>Scroll down to ""Options for zodiac and houses"" 

>Look to the right and choose Draconic in place of Tropical or Sidereal 

>Post your chart into the thread via imgur or some other image hosting platform! 

At the bottom of the page there is an option to produce an anonymised chart which won't contain any of your personal details, and of course you can always open the image in paint and black everything out. 

Good luck to you! Last time I predicted a shocking level of accuracy, but this is new and untested ground, and I have no idea what to expect. After reading the degrees of my own chart, I certainly did *see* the resemblance, but of course it's easy to see a resemblance when you expect to find it. These tests are no-nonsense blind picks, and assuming people don't cheat (which would be pointless! I'm conducting *science* here people), the results make a pretty strong statement! 

Those who participated in the first contest are more than welcome to play again, and, in fact, I would be especially interested in their input as to the differences between the two charts, and whether they could identify themselves in both. 

Edit: Oh and a BIG disclaimer: You must have an accurate TIME, place, AND date of birth, or this will not work. We're dealing with the exact degree placements here, so even being off by a few hours (or less than one hour) will make this impossible.

0,aiyxmp,26,38,"I, along with several others, posted on Soulnexus (and elsewhere) about experiencing heightened or otherwise unusually potent dreams the night of the blood Moon. And since then they've actually escalated for me. Last night I only slept for a few hours, but I had an enormous array of dreams which felt as though they took place on a much grander timescale. Although I wasn't lucid during any of my dreaming, what I experienced was unusually vivid, intense, and also *meaningful* to put i generally. When I woke up after only several hours (and I was exceptionally tired) I was compelled to ruminate over what I had experienced with my now waking mind, rather than go back to sleep; I suspect this was in order to synthesize the experience into memory/knowledge.

Unlike what I normally experience while dreaming (although I am a different person in my dreams relatively often), during all of the events I seemed to be viewing reality from multiple angles and timelines; sometimes I wasn't even a human being, but rather a force or non-corporeal entity. During one of my dreams I was fighting as a soldier for both sides during a single battle. Men were trying to scale a large snowy hill/cliff and were being shot at from above. I was alternating between shooting at the climbers and being one of the climbers (I actually reflected to myself that I preferred *not* being amongst the climbers, haha). When I managed to climb up the mountain I was involved in some sort of scrap during which (and this is going to be very hard to explain, but it made sense then) either myself or the person I was fighting slipped on some blood, and that blood was there because of a memory I had of another confrontation that was to take place in the future. I'm doing a very poor job of explaining this, but I was continuously experiencing the apprehension of events within my dream as a MEMORY from the ""future"" of something ""I"" had already been involved in. And, as I stated, ""I"" during these dreams was never a fully individuated person, but rather could be anyone, with any memory of any experience. 

I've really never experienced anything quite like these dreams (well, at least not in recent memory). At one point I was the man betrayed by a small group of conspirators and, I believe, murdered. When I took possession of the body of one of my murderers, I planned revenge on the ringleader, but instead simply paused and experienced his life for a time. 

In a sort of nightmare scenario I was in an old wooden house, near the sea, during a terrible storm. There was a woman on a rowboat who was always lingering around. I was afraid that she would come to my house, because she was constantly screaming horribly. I really wish I were better at remember this scene precisely because it was genuinely tense, suspenseful, and frightening. I eventually ended up taking my own boat onto the sea to meet her and she turned out to be young, but skeletal/ghostly, and with unusually long limbs. When I returned home, she followed me, and stood below my balcony, laughing that I had been so frightened of her (also her face might have been my exe's soooooo). 

Other things happened that were more reflective of a typical dream, and the kind of worries and motives I bring to that realm. I got in a fight with my sister over politics (lol), and was locked outside of my house in my underwear (also lol). But even these were unusual in their vibrancy and violent *realism*. 

Is anyone else having dreams like these lately?

0,aiwzfu,1,4,"I was sitting underneath the moon right as it was about to be overwhelmed by the shadow, admiring its beauty before I was to pray. I couldn't help thinking while staring at it, in that light, at that moment the moon looked to incredibly different, like staring at some sort of craft in the sky that was staring back. I could feel its place in the sky, and the distance between us. Its' presence felt much closer to me than where the moon should be and was.

The glowing light of the moon was being swallowed, in its last moments it was giving off a white glow radiant just above it. When I focused on looking at the center of this aura-like glow radiating off the moon I believe I could see an angel standing in the light. A white outline, pure, and a halo just above the spirit.

Leading up to the blood moon I have been trying to open my third eye. Recently I have noticed little pieces of dust floating around in the air that I would otherwise look past. It feels like im starting to see the shapes and silhouettes that appear in the darkness when you have your eyes closed when my eyes are opened. It doesn't impair my vision, I just notice it there.

I love the things I read and learn in this community. I have been meditating, trying to astrally project, listening to healing frequencies, and trying to move myself into the spiritual position where I can heal and learn. I'd like to know if anyone felt this uneasy feeling about the moon ( to me it felt like some extraterrestrial object when I saw it in that light), or if they have had any experience seeing things like this when they were trying to open their third eye, and grow spiritually.",new,Blood moon & vision clarity.,4
0,aispcb,2,3,"Hey all, hoping for some insight into what I saw in my living room on Sunday. I was talking on my cell when I was drawn to the ceiling. What I saw was a huge black crow flying near the ceiling. When it dissipated, I saw a slight black cloud. 

Weird thing is, the day before I saw an actual crow. Just one as if it followed me down the street. 

I looked up the meaning of a black crow and it says it may be a symbol of life magic and mysterious...intelligence, flexibility and destiny. 

Has anyone had this happen to them before? I’ve seen flashes of light and lights that dance in my trees but never this type of imagery. ",new,Black crow flying in living room,3
0,aiuff7,28,18,"I have been a Reiki Master for almost 18 years now; that is to say, a master of everything I was taught. Universal Life Force or Energy is wonderful to channel, but it is so broad and nonspecific that it’s sometimes difficult to learn from. It does all the work, to be sure, but what lies beyond the work?

What I learned to be curious about was channeling divine spirits that were closer to me in kind, so I could relate more, understand things easier. At every level of our evolution, I think it’s easiest to relate to and learn from the spirit one step above us. When I was a JV wrestler, I learned most, practically, from the varsity guy, not some NCAA superstar (like Dan Gabel; dating myself) who I couldn’t relate to at all.

The thing about higher vibrational realms is, it doesn’t matter who you know; it only matters that you approach them with love and ask them for help. So if you believe the next spiritual realm above us to be filled with the spirit of nature, or fairies, or Sasquatch, or earthly angels, they don’t care; they’re just happy to help. Do I care if somebody knows who I am, what I do for a living, what nationality, religion, if they are asking for help? I don’t stop to correct them if they think I’m Spanish because I look that way to them. I say, “Hey! How can I help you?!” Why would next level spirits do or be any less.

Since pondering all this and believing all this, I have connected with and received Reiki from the spirit of my meditation tree; solid, calming, balancing, introverted in the winter, extroverted in the summer, and all the lessons that come with those energetical vibrations. And the spirit of the tree is connected to the next level spirit above him (my tree’s a guy, call him Doc), and to the spirit above her, and him, and her, and so on up to the UniversAll. The power of the full-spectrum channel is literally connected through all the vibrational frequencies; yet, it’s also specific, relatable, understandable, experienceable. It’s next level Reiki.

I’m going to close by sharing a personal experience I recently had, and my thoughts around it. If you’re with me so far, I hope you see and learn about something you are seeking, if you are seeking. If not, at least I hope you find it amusing:

I listened to this interesting guy on YouTube the other day and he was talking about how Sasquatch and aliens help heal him, and he in turn helps others heal. So I started meditating and—fortunately—connecting with a Sasquatch spirit. It is docile, loving, calming, powerful, and healing; I could feel it aligning things in my head—energetically, and like getting a physical brain massage—and wondered what differences I might experience as a result.

So I was brushing my teeth just now, and I inhaled some toothpaste, pretty deep into my lungs; I started coughing, voluntarily and involuntarily, but it wasn’t moving or coming up. So I gave myself Reiki (which is as simple as anyone holding their palms intentionally toward themselves) and I asked the Sasquatch spirit to help me. My energy elevated, and I know this, because I felt fine, as someone with no issues, perfectly healthy.

Then I put my hands down, my energy dropped down a notch again, and I started instantly coughing. The toothpaste was still down there; it didn’t magically disappear. So what the frack happened? I put my hands up again, felt my energy rise a tad, and it was again like I had no body, no issues, no toothpaste, no cough. And with that, the answer came into my head, as if the Sasquatch had put it there:

At our current level of energetical existence, because of the lower vibrational average, we will, as a matter of fact, law, cause and effect, toothpaste in lungs, we will have problems. But just one notch up, that vibrational level is where matter starts to become energy, such physical matters cease to exist (though on the parallel physical plane, they are still there; matter, toothpaste, cannot be destroyed, but it can be transcended).",new,Next Level Reiki,18
0,aitw7f,31,22," One of the things that I went through, after awakening, was letting go of religion and its believe structure according to evangelism. This process came with a lot of anger because I foolishly accepted religion as the one and only truth. When I started researching ancient religions I came to realize that many of the stories written in the Bible had also happened in other cultures predating Christianity. This was a Revelation with a capital ""R"". My anger subsided and a deeper understanding of scripture arose viewed through the teachings of numerology and astrology.  


**Spirit said the following:** If all of mankind would truly understand the symbolism and hidden knowledge spread among all ""sacred"" texts, you would make huge leaps in your collective consciousness. All knowledge has already been written and shared. It's just a matter of putting it all together.  


In many ancient stories, myths, sagas, religions, teachings, and texts we find knowledge about ""the ascension"". The one that is widely overlooked by a fast population of believers are the teachings of Jesus. It's almost as if people are afraid to look into it with a healthy dose of skepticism.  
Could it really still be a taboo because of fear and dogma created by Catholicism?  
Many people don't look deeper into the meaning of these texts and thus only grasp a part of what it is teaching us, and so it is misunderstood.  


In spirituality ""Christ"" consciousness is soul consciousness. When you view your life and all of its experiences through the eyes of the soul (higher perspective), you'll shift from human to soul consciousness. Most people are still attached to the physical reality and are not operating from the soul's perspectives. They haven't established clear communications with the higher-self, spirit guides, angels, and so on. But, this doesn't mean that you can't open up and receive knowledge and information via intuition, synchronicities, numerology, astrology, and so on. You don't have to have direct communications with spirit in order to change your perspectives from human to soul consciousness and activate the love and light which is in all of us.  


All over the internet, spiritual communities are popping up. All over the internet, spiritual knowledge is shared. These are very exciting times indeed. We are all here to bring awareness and have an important part to play in this ascension!  


**Let's take a look at Revelation and what it says about the 144.000**  


**Revelation 7:4,** “And I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel.”

**Revelation 14:1,** “Then I looked, and behold, the Lamb was standing on Mount Zion, and with him, one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father written on their foreheads.”

**Revelation 14:3,** “And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one could learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been purchased from the earth.”  


**Meaning of 144.000 in numerology:**  
When adding up 144.000 you get the number 9. What does the number 9 mean? I found the following information in Cheiro's book of numbers:  
\- Nr. 9 offers love and care to the world at large  
\- Nr. 9 has global consciousness  
\- Nr. 9 lives in the world and understands the connections between all of mankind  
\- Nr. 9 appearing as a cycle often denotes finality, the completion of an era  
\- Nr. 9 is the symbol of wisdom and initiation. It's highly emotional and spiritual  
\- Nr. 9 holds the path toward mystical knowledge  


In some Hebrew writings, it is taught that God descended to earth a total of 9 times. At the 10th coming, this earth will pass away and a new one will be created. **THE NEW EARTH**.

Number 9 is also the number of mankind. 666 totals 18 which totals 9.  

**Revelation 13-18**: Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of man, and this number is 666.

Numbers in the bible have an astrological meaning as well. When 12 is used as a number of nations it represents all the people born under the 12 signs of the zodiac, and therefore the whole human race. The tribes of Israel is the entire human population. **It refers to all of us!**

In short:

Christ = Lamb = Soul consciousness = 5D

Satan = Goat = Human consciousness = 3D

When Christ stands on Mount Zion it means that the collective global consciousness has risen (awakened). In Hinduism, this is called the Kundalini. When this is awakened you will look at life from the souls perspective and the road to ascension begins.  

I hope that this information will give you clarity about the significance of the number 144.000 and the ascension. ",new,Ascension and the 144.000 mentioned in Revelation,22

0,air7q0,2,15," One of the most enlightening exercises I've done is to simply look back at your entire life, watch it like it is a movie, from the first day of school to the last. The awkward moments, the tough times, the best times, the adventures, the lessons, the miracles, the synchronicities. All of it. 

As you're watching this movie, think of your purpose, why you are here, what you are going to create, do or be in this life. Notice that everything that has happened in your life has been a necessary piece of your purpose. I say ""necessary"" because it happened, wouldn't have happened if it wasn't necessary.  If you can't quite understand this from where you are currently, just have a little faith, that even the hard times happen for your benefit, for the benefit of your higher purpose. 

When I did this, it opened my eyes to so much. I became not resentful or regretful of my past, but grateful! I actually thanked the universe for these moments. I realized that I would not have the friends I have, I would not be the person I am, I would not have created the things that I have if my life were different. I wouldn't have half the drive and determination as I do. So I remain grateful. 

If you carry around with your resentment, regret, shame, guilt, or anything relating to your life story, I highly recommend you sit in a quiet room, empty the mind and begin conscious playing the movie of your life. Even if you are not able to notice the patterns and how the good and bad times have shaped you just make the declaration that you are going to be grateful for these moments. Just say this to yourself, promise that you will try at least each day to appreciate everything, leaving nothing out. You came from oneness, your nature is oneness. The moment you appreciate one thing but resent another, you are no longer aligned with oneness which is your source, it is you. 

Hope this little post helps you on your path!

0,aiq9k1,7,14,"I've experienced lucid dreaming on and off ever since childhood... I'm no stranger to the magic of flying consciously through intentional dreamscapes of the highest order of imagination, yet what I'm about to describe is on another level entirely...


So recently I've been experiencing this bizarre phenomenon of what I can only describe as ""cosmic sex"" where I find myself in this state of absolutely ravenous, all consuming ecstasy while waking up from sleeping.


I'm conscious and aware... but only so far as to know I am experiencing this perfect bliss, not aware enough to become lucid and realize I'm in a state of half sleep/ half wakfulness. In other words, I do not question the authenticity of this other reality, I simply accept it and carry on... business as usual. I suppose it is a good thing that I have not become lucid thus far, or I would probably spoil the mood by asking to many questions of this divine goddess I'm uniting with, regarding the many mysteries of existence or something... 


All I do know is that... this, my friends is a true taste of the divine if there ever was... one in which my soul or energy body or whatever you want to call it, is becoming one with that of another, on a higher plane where two can truly unite... the other being is a strangely familiar feminine force. I feel as though I know her, but she is not necessarily visible in the traditional sense, I cannot see her face but I can feel her energy, every part of her... as if her body is somehow part of me, there is no seperation between us.


There is an overwhelming hunger, and I feed it instinctively... the motion in the artful rhythms of the dance of creation play in my mind to ignite the intense fires of ungoverned passion within her lowest chakras. I fan the flames of pure orgasmic bliss, wafting the lifeforce up ancient energetic pathways, it pools in her expanding heart center filling it to capacity, and then it begins to overflow, spilling upwards, causing waves of undulating biological serpant energy to shoot straight up and out from her crown. Playing the rainbow colored notes of the universal song of love through her being like an instrument, the purple and green wisps of lighter than air, electric cum curl up and out... exploding into the ether, instanteaneosly inciting a psychedelic sexperience within, the audible vibrations ring true... angels harps and devil's trombones wail... the source of Hendrix guitar releases in tune to the frequency of our writhing forms. Our crowns illuminated, hot embers in the void, emitters of the purest source... Capital L.O.V.E. enriching our combined energy bodies on every level while simultaneously permeating and benefiting the entirety of existence.


This is truly the essence of gods I feel.


The mindspace I occupy during the preceeding act is not the one driving this modest meat suit during normal day to day activities, no, this is on another level entirely, my senses in this state are not limited to trivial earthly ones, but a heightened sense of complete awareness is present... sort of an electric buzzing feeling comprises everything... every microscopic, indivisible point of space behaves like a pixel on a screen, stationary... yet ready to flip to sell the hologram the moment it's space becomes occupied... We have expanded to encompass the whole of existance, I can feel the furthest corners of the cosmos just as the tips of my limbs... I am not in my body, yet I feel I am somehow still remotely attached to it. 


As I return to a wakeful state in 3d space, I ever so slowly become aware of the world around me... and my earth partner beside me.
The two realities blend from one into the next with the former usually fading from existence, before ever forming a solid memory, back to the realm where forgotten dreams reside.


The only reason I am able to remember this instance and share it with you is because my lady asked if I could remember the events of the night before...


Like flicking on a light switch, the memory comes rushing back into my mind!

When I was 16 I had an extremely intense LSD trip that changed my life. I learned about the unconditional love of God for all. I learned that all human beings are interconnected and we are all brothers and sisters. God's love is so powerful and so pure, it flowed through me unceasingly to such an extent that you are utterly dumbfounded that there would be so much love for you, just a simple human being. It is true, we are all a part of Him, and He is in us, and we are One.

This experience was so intense and beautiful that I shed a tear, but only a few, because it's truly impossible to be sad during this because you understand you are so fulfilled/loved/protected and truly lack nothing. There is nothing which you lack, and there is nothing which you need. You are one with God and loved by Him, and that's the natural order of things.

I firmly believe that we are coming to a point as a collective, in which the veil will be lifted and we will once again understand this unconditional love.

I don't know about you, but I have struggled for a long time with caring about what other people think of me. It's weird too because when I was a kid being loud and weird in the supermarket, my mother would say ""Can you stop? You're embarrassing me, people are watching."" I never understood the concept of embarrassment, of worrying about what others think of you. Until the ego develops and we begin identifying ourselves with our bodies, our clothes, our skills, our accomplishments and of course, what others think. This is an incredible trap, I started feeling nervous walking down the street because I would feel judged by the people driving by. I remember one time I got a hair cut that I did not like so I stayed home from school until I could get another cut to fix it. 

I started being somebody that I am not, just to please others, so that I could build up this ego identity. The big issue here is that all of this is totally out of my control. I don't control whether or not you will like me, we all have free will. Not to mention, none of this will make me happy long term, the ego always needs more. 10 people like me? I need 20! 20 people like me? I need 30! On and on this goes. When we take a step back and decide to be ourselves, to love ourselves, to pursue some sort of dream or goal, to create what we want to create and to realize that we are not the ego, then, and only then can we live an exciting, free, joyful experience of life. Not saying get rid of the ego, because it is a part of human nature, I am just saying, decide to live in alignment with your higher self, with your values, be yourself! 

It takes an ego to judge, but it also takes an ego to care about that judgment, to take it to heart. Decide that you want to feel good, you want to be yourself, you want to be happy and at peace. Just establish that none of this is helping you get closer to feeling the way you want to feel. Lastly, just picture yourself as a confident, strong, attractive, leader type of person who knows what he/she wants, who chooses to have fun, to play, to be themselves, who is free from concern. Imagine yourself as this person, keep this picture in your mind's eye. It could be anything, just picture yourself how you would like to be. Now make the decision each day to cultivate this being, to live in alignment with this. Because this, is you, if it was not you, then you wouldn't want to picture it and be it. This is you, beneath all the worries and anxieties and insecurities, this is you! I hope this helps you relieve some stress that you may be carrying due to your worry about the opinions of others. Thank you!

0,aictkd,1,4,"I like to keep things real simple, basic. From a simple yet solid foundation, people can personalize their experiences all they want. So what is the simplest way to describe spiritual development in a nutshell, no matter the level (or dimension)?

It helps to start with the basics of everything that exists,  which can be broken down into three simple descriptors: category, influence and balance*. Example 1: I’m a person, I currently majorly influence myself, my wife, my friends and family, and I am currently mostly balanced.  Example 2: There is a foundation from which all is created and sustained, it has total potential influence, and is perfectly balanced. Ok, so how does all this relate to spiritual development?

Wherever you are on your spiritual journey, you are responsible for balancing whatever influence you have been given; doing so holds the potential to level-up your influence (and category), which in-turn will require more balancing, and so on. 

Sounds like a lot, but there seem to be plenty of breaks, provided we balance often. You could argue to not concern yourself too much with influence or category, but instead just focus on balancing in every moment, for that will move you onward with the least dramatic effect.

So, spiritual development, in a nutshell, can be whittled-down to the act of balancing. Too simple? What do you think?

0,ai2gpv,7,17," Shadow work is an important part of spiritual evolution and your journey to higher states of consciousness. Learning to accept and love the shadow within unconditionally is fundamental in accepting and loving others unconditionally. The shadow self, the way I have experienced it, is simply a part of your psyche that is pushed down, judged as wrong, suppressed, unwanted and does not serve you in your spiritual endeavors. Traumatic experiences, embarrassments, insecurities, hatred, addiction, doubts, worries. For me, these were the pieces that made up the shadow within. 

Think of the shadow like a dark room in your home, a room that you never visit. You toss garbage in there, broken things, old food and so on. But you've never seen what the room looks like, you simply open the door, throw things in there, shut it and move on with your life. Soon you begin to smell something rotten in your home, you buy air freshener and the problem is solved. Until you see a couple rats scurry under the door of this room. You finally decide to open the door and turn the light on and you finally are aware of what you have been building up inside. Now you decided once and for all you are going to do whatever it takes to clean this room up, and maybe make space for a studio or an art room, a space for some sort of expression. 

I hope this analogy makes sense, so how do we clean up the mess we have been pushing down for so long? We introduce light. How do you get rid of shadow, you shine light. Think of light in this context as your presence, your consciousness, your unconditional love, acceptance, and attention. What I did to overcome the shadow was to simply meditate, empty the mind, and consciously accept this part of myself, consciously love it, and it seemed to fade away literally. Like cleaning of a whiteboard, I was able to re-write whatever I wanted. I had total control over what things meant to me, how I felt about the circumstances of my life.

To this day I am still actively doing shadow work and becoming more and more present each day. I can feel the bliss, joy and excitement build with each passing day and I am so grateful for the guidance I've receive physically and spiritually. If you have any further suggestions in terms of how to effectively shed light on the shadow self, please let me know, I am always open to learning. Thank you so much

As he continues talking I zone out. I go, duh, humans have the same fundamental frequency. I try to prove it by visualizing it using dots on the screen.

Meditation is the cultivation of the mind and its essential ingredient is awareness.

You can bring awareness with you anywhere and use at any given moment.  In fact, the more, the merrier..

What is awareness of the mind ? It is simply observing non judgmentally the movements of your mind.

It is pretty much doing what you do during meditation all the time.  You are right, it is not an easy task.

It takes some practice to have this passive state of awareness.  Just meditating 10-15 minutes a day can propel you to this path.

In meditation, we practice awareness of everything that is happening in the mind which includes sounds, aches, visions, etc

As a constant practice, you need to start with awareness of your thoughts and emotions.  Unaware by us, there is so much negativity in our thoughts and so much energy is being stripped from us.

I think that this ""Wolf"" moon has ""the boy who cried Wolf"" energy, because I bet that as soon as this wave of energy moves through this portal, collectively all our current woes will be old news, as new timelines emerge.

This eclipse is definitely, for me - putting a hold on my physical manifestations, and bringing up my natural human inclination to be doubtful or fearful. Here's the advice I have for myself that I have had on repeat in my mind, and even out loud:

 ""Everything is working out in my highest and greatest good!"" 

It's very easy to slip back into fear-based thinking, and in doing so you block your manifestation channel from your higher self, and your cord to Creator energy. Personally, from this point forward I am not going to put any more nervous, negative, or unhelpful energy into my financial situation. I'm only going to project positivity, and abundance into the universe. If you are going through a similar problem, repeat things out loud like: ""I will make enough money to pay my rent, and still comfortably support myself."" Or ""My project or goal is unfolding in perfect timing, and synchronicities.""

I hope this helps you combat the anxiety, or backtracking that the eclipse may bring about.

0,ahpbkj,0,8,"An unbelievable interview with Lisa Transcendence Brown (pasted below). I have been awakening to a higher reality over the past three years, and my battle has been to finally accept that I'd become narcissistic, and that I'd hurt people I'd loved in my lifetime, but that it is all OK. All of our mistakes are okay. We only created 'mis-takes' through mis-understanding who and what we are. And by not seeing into the truth of our mistakes being OK, we attach ourselves to the past, which disallows us from existing in the present. Only in the present does a human being see into his true nature, and only in the present does true healing take place. Thus, I believe many of us are going through existential breakdowns, only to be built back up into who we really are. The conditioning must fall.

Bear with me, as I'd like to refer to my own life as a preface for what I believe is happening on our planet and through our people.

Interview link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUwXS6Q7JEA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUwXS6Q7JEA)

I hope some of you will find my story interesting: Trips on psychedelics, a lifetime of deep thinking, being raised by one narcissistic parent and one empathetic parent (my parents' vast dissimilarities created a sort of confusing paradigm in me, making it challenging to be centered my entire life), and being a bodybuilding musician (unusual in this world) has provided me with a sort of strange (relative to the common person) perspective on myself and life, and it sort of kept me always looking from the outside in (I never 'fit in' despite everyone thinking I was very popular. My 'acting' was popular; not me!).

At a young age, my unusual perspective caused me to start asking questions, like, ""Who and what am I?"" and I asked these questions with a regretful intensity, as I was so sick of feeling tremendous lack, anxiety, and fear. Consequently, I have learned things about the nature of mind that are fascinating (after experiencing unbelievable suffering and terror), and I have begun to see how we are undoubtedly entering a higher, more conscious reality as our relationship *with* consciousness becomes more and more unified. And, because we *are* consciousness, this higher reality feels more real and natural and blissful than anything we've known, as this process is essentially, from one perspective, consciousness becoming conscious of itself *as* consciousness, which is everything. In other words, we are actively remembering that we are, quite literally, everything. We are infinity, which is embodied as pure love. How could we *not* be pure love, if we are infinity? How could infinity not be pure, abundant, boundless love? Infinity has to be pure love because, if it was not, then it would attach itself to its flaws, disallowing it to flow as infinity naturally does. Infinity *has* to flow, in order to be infinity. And flow *is* love, as flow is the manifestation of a lack of attachment. And a lack of attachment implies a lack of lack, thus a lack of attachment implies wholeness. Wholeness implies authenticity. When we are authentically ourselves, we are infinity.

Bear with me, as people in my immediate circle who have had no experience with spiritual inquisitionsoften think I am insane. But what I write below is what I have concluded, based on three years of introspective inquiring and studying the conspiracies of our world.

We picked up unbelievably wicked conditioning by being born into a reality that was already being controlled by people with negative agendas. These people understand that trauma splits the mind in two (9/11, for example, was one method used to induce global trauma, as the agenda has been to obtain global control of consciousness), as it creates a reality in the mind where there is an enjoyable state (being happy or content) and an unenjoyable state (terror, anger, sadness, confusion, depression, etc.). After a traumatic experience, the mind must create a 'me' in its conscious field that is conceptually running away from an 'it' ('it' being the trauma, itself). But that entire relationship, between me and 'it', is illusory, and it creates a belief system in the mind that prevents the mind from seeing into its true, peaceful, centered, self-less nature as the one consciousness that is all things.

We picked up unbelievably wicked conditioning by being born into a world that was deeply unconscious, thus we had almost no one authentic to learn from. Personally, to see interviews like this is something that nearly brings me to tears because it, finally, becomes very clear that we truly are entering a new reality. But, what is so fascinating to me is that this 'new reality' was already here. It is what we are, and it comes out through who we are. And in order to create this 'new' reality, all we must do is slow our minds and perceive our pasts with an open heart, because that process shows you the mistakes you made in the past, and how you didn't 'mean' to do them, but that your conditioning caused you to act on behalf of a false paradigm, called 'me'. The infamous ego. So fascinating. We must take responsibility for all the wrongs we've done, but we must also see how those wrongs weren't truly intentional because they weren't coming from a true and real place. They were coming from fear and distortion. But the ego will soon be conquered (accepted and loved), and the world will soon remember itself as Harmony and Light.

Boy -- what a time to be alive. Anyway, I wanted to share this interview with you guys, in hopes that it might bring someone else the same breath of fresh air that it brought me.

0,ahp2jn,4,23," 

When you hear someone say to you ""you aren't good enough"" or ""you can't do that"" or ""that is dangerous"" soon their voice becomes your inner voice. You start telling yourself that you are not good enough, that you can't do certain things. Someone else's doubts and fears, become your doubts and fears. Our subconscious mind is always taking and storing information, this happens without our consciously being aware of it. So you may have seen someone in a movie talk about how nasty tofu is, and so when your pal offers you tofu you tell them without hesitation ""no, that's gross, thanks though"". This is a small example but I promise you it happens constantly! 

I'm not saying stop watching movies, and don't play violent video games. What I am saying is be present with yourself and do not allow the mind to pull out random thoughts that were placed in you without your conscious awareness of it. Meaning, we are being programmed by the things we expose our 5 senses too, what people tell us, what we see, what we listen too, even the temperature outside. When we cultivate presence and learn to be here in this moment, accepting it fully, living in the now, making decisions in the now, taking actions in the now, we can find peace of mind. We can more naturally align with who we really are, align with what makes us happy and excited. 

Give yourself a break though, you may be in a negative place emotionally and mentally, and that is ok. It's not about changing the present, it's about living here fully and accepting it 100%. The easiest way to practice presence and to reclaim who you really are is through meditation. Just sit and breath 5 minutes at least. If you have never done mindfulness meditation (where you sit and focus on the breath and observe your thoughts) you will know what I mean when I talk about how loud and messy the human mind is. These thoughts are not you, you are flow, joy, love, peace. Maybe you're an artist or an athlete, you might never find out unless you look within and sit until the dust settles, then you might find your purpose in life! Best of luck to your endeavors.

0,ahjztr,6,6,"So often in this sub, I see texts supporting one religious train of thought or another. I know I cannot be the only voyager on this path of discovery and spirituality, who has not become more curious, more exploratory and more of an apostate of the established spiritual forms as a result of my journey.

One of the precepts in I appreciate in this sub is that of diversity and possibility. So  many philosophies are discussed here.

Due to my own personal sensitivities, I do not perceive what I call the ""Love and Rainbows"" sort of spirituality. I feel suffering, pain, apathy and despair, as well as love and joy, in my life and the lives of others. 

 I seek a true understanding of the nature of the Universe and the acceptance of the good and evil, the actual spectrum  of natures of humans,  as a significant step in that path. There isn't always a reason why things occur the way that they do. It isn't as easy as ""You are Loved"". If it were, no one would need a Soul Journey. I don't believe in fate, I believe in choices, free will.

There is ugliness and horror and real pain. There is happiness. It is never a constant.

My personal spiritual journey led me to question the teachings of my childhood faith, rather than to blindly accept the dogmas of this faith or that faith, but, instead to search within myself for truth, my truth. 

I rejected the hypocrisies and paradoxical teachings, i.e for me the ""You are Loved, but, only if you tow the line"" sort of dichotomies in Western religious sects.

It led me into apostasy. It led me into questioning and growth. it gave me more questions and fewer answers.

In addition, since a part of my growth has always been a sensitivity to the spirit world and a perception of the spider-web-like possibilities, the fragments,   in various potential timelines and futures, I can't adhere to any  established belief system. I do use the tools developed in many of them for self assessment, I use those tools for spiritual and psychic development. I use them to try to understand and to process what I am learning and experiencing. 

That is my journey into spirituality. That awareness of what is and what was and what can be, the fragments of truth, the possible fractals, that which makes us complex and human.

As we all explore spirituality and learn grow and transform, we question, reassess and reevaluate. 

I don't see it as simple as ""You are Loved by God or Source"". I can't blindly accept any of that. I have so many questions.

You attract what you think about most and you manifest your reality by using language (SPEL-ling). Thoughts, language, sounds, numbers, and words all have their unique frequency and vibration. Cusswords are low in frequency and loving words are high in frequency. Because of this, your words can highly affect yours and the well-being of others.   


Years ago, I went to a seminar about St. Germain, an ascended master, and alchemist. He brings the gift of the violet flame which is the 7th ray of the Holy Spirit. This energy has healing capacities and appears violet to people with developed spiritual senses.  
Everyone in our group received a bottle of water and was asked to direct their attention to the water and visualize positive healing energy purifying it. In some cases, the water started to bubble, like you see when you open a carbonated can of soda. Even the taste of the water improved significantly. Just like people, water holds consciousness (everything does because it's all energy). There are no limitations to what you can create when you utilize the power of your own thoughts. Why does this work?  


As Tesla said: ""If you want to understand the workings of the Universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration."" Which brings me to the following, ""**The Law of Vibration**"".  
The law of vibration serves as the foundation of the law of attraction. So, what is the law of vibration all about? Here are some principles:  
\- Everything in the universe moves and vibrates at their own speed and frequency  
\- Everything and everyone is connected through energy  
\- Everything has its own vibration and frequency  


Imagine what you can create when you use your words and thoughts in a positive, constructive and conscious way. A study was done by Dr. Masaru Emoto on the consciousness of water and how water reacts when spoken to (The vibrations of spoken words). It was remarkable to see how beautiful words such as love, creates a beautiful image and harsh words create ugly images. You can find this video on Youtube or click on the link to go to my blog where I also posted the video.  


The vibrations that form life are found in the vowel sounds of God's name according to the Kabbalah. When I speak about God I mean soul essence, the light, energy, higher consciousness (Christ consciousness), the source and origin of all things. God is not confined to religion because it's found everywhere in and around us. God is the Trinity including the good, bad, and the ugly.  


**Final thought:** What you say has a profound effect on you and the people around you. So, what is it that you want to create for yourself? ",new,What do you want to create? - The vibration of words,28
0,ahhmq7,26,34,"**Find someone you love, who loves you, who is also Love, and be also Love yourself.**

&#x200B;

Next time you're with them, hold them.  And pay attention.  What do you feel?  Where do you feel it?  Do you feel vibrations in your nerves?  Are they vibrating fast or slow, how many between each heart beat, and what is the rhythm of both hearts your feel?  What is the position of your body?  Where are your arms? Legs? Mouth?  What colors do you see in your thoughts?  What is the image you see in your eyes?  What is the image they see in their eyes?  Where are you?  What does the room look like?  Where is it?  What time is it? What's the last thing you remember before this moment?  What do you imagine will be the next thing you remember after it?

&#x200B;

Perceive, and commit to memory, as much information connected to your Emotion, your Thought, your Body, as you can, and include that person you Love in that Perspective, as that Perspective.  Create a Memory, with the Information of that Moment in as many dimensions with associations and connections between them to your Emotion, Thought, and Body as you can.  

&#x200B;

Hold that Memory as a singular package of Information in your Mind.  Can you enter it, and remember the moment in detail?  Can you feel the configuration of your bodies? Can you feel them as one body? Can you remember your Thoughts in their orders?  Can you Feel the touch and vibrations and replay their song in your Mind when you call that Memory back?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, hold that Memory in your Mind's eye and put a ""word"" on top of it.  It can be anything you would like, (say, ""banana"" or ""Pikachu""), but put that word on top of the Memory you created in your mind's eye.  Both the word in the form of the letters in the language you know, but also its sound, the vibrations that come out of your Voice if you were to say it out loud, the vibrations that play in your Mind if you just think the word in it, and the Image of the word's meaning in your other associations (e.g. what a banana or a Pikachu looks like to you).  Next, also do the same thing as if the word was spoken by the person you are with that is Love when you are Love, too.  Hear her or his voice say the word, see his or her mind think the word and perceive the Image.  Now combine all of those vibrations in your mind into a harmony.  What does it sound like when you BOTH say the word at the same time?  What does it look like when you BOTH see the word through two different eyes as one Image.  Your biology is already designed to help you do this.  See from your left eye as you and your right as them, and hold the single perspective as you do with vision.  Hear the word in your right ear as your voice, and from the left, their voice, as one word spoken from a **Voice** that is your voices.

&#x200B;

Attach that word and its information to the Memory you created in Love.  Merge its images and sounds of vibration through the Memory, allow the vibrations of the word to wrap around the Memory, and secure its Form for you.  Allow the image of the Word to paint over and in and around the Memory with the Voice of your voices.  Make the Word and the Memory one in your Mind's Eye.  Keep doing that, until you can Call it at (or, ""with"") your **Will**.  When you hear, ""**Pikachu**""--where are **Y**ou?  If you see a ""banana,"" can you walk into the Memory and recall the angle of your elbow that was supporting a head that you love that is also yours in Love?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, take a peek at the [Phoenician Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet).  Go find the symbol for ""**hook**.""  It looks like a ""Y,"" just like the ""Y"" in, Yet.  Remember, Yet.  Got it, **Y**et?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, take the Word that is also the Memory of Love in your Mind's Eye, and stick it right smack in the center of that ""Y"" to create a ""**hook**"" at the single point in the middle.  Let the Word-Memory-Love expand outwards in a sphere, its information growing out in all directions from that center point, see it grow and expand larger than the ""Y,"" larger than the Yet, and keep expanding outwards from the center of your Mind.  Make it larger, larger than your head, then larger than the room you are in, larger than the building, the continent, the planet, the solar system, the galaxy, the universe... keep expanding it outwards until you can not even perceive how larger it is, but keep expanding it in your Mind's eye until it has enough momentum that you can not think about its expansion, but know that it is still expanding, and feel its expansion.  Feel it?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, while you still Feel it expanding, See its edges come back up through that infinitely small point in the center of the **hook** that is the ""Y"" in Yet, but See the edges as twisted into threads of information, separating the Sphere that is still expanding into the two Branches of the Y, each thread split again from the Sphere coming back up through the Point where it started from to expand and going into two different directions in front of you.  See those threads continue to grow in their own directions away from the first until they go so far in their own directions you cannot see the tips of the threads they started from in your View anymore.  Just like the Sphere that is still expanding, Feel the expansion of that Sphere continue to push those threads farther in your View, and Set that movement as continuous while it continues, so that you can Feel it, but is now so far away from your sight that you cannot perceive the geometry of where either starts or ends, but just Feel and Know that they still moving, and will continue to move, when your Mind is not actively perceiving it.  Test it, Pikachu.  Is the movement back in a way that it never was gone?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, focus on the **hook** again, see the movements of the geometries you created that in combination with the Word Memory Love, but focus on the shape of the **hook** as a ""Y."" and then rotate the hook in your Mind so the single thread facing down that forms the bottom of the Mark is perpendicular to the Mark by facing you.  Look through it, to the two tunnels that form at the mid-point and go off in their never-ending directions, where there is a Sphere expanding outwards as well that also comes back and forms those thread.  Imagine whatever you would like as a Future in that tunnel, and walk through it.  As you walk, allow the threads that have been apart going in their own directions to twist around each other again right before you get to the next frame of perception in your imagination as your imagine your perception of the Future.  Now go faster.  Blur the images and the threads and move your perception as fast as you can, and then go faster, and faster, and faster, and then just, **STOP**.  See one of your **Deaths**.  And allow your **Darkness** to just float out of you and surround **Light** that is always there.  Allow yourself not to think, but just perceive.  Perceive as if you have forgotten everything you know, all of your Memory, and anything that makes your self, you.  Try to think of something, but also, do not allow yourself to think.  Be stuck for a bit.  Are you thinking?  Can you think? No.

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Now, just look for the **hook**.  See the **Mark** in the Light, and tug on it.  Allow the banana's image or Pikachu's sound to form within and around it, and say the Word out loud and have it **C**all the Memory of your **P**oint in Love.  Allow the Memory to be **F***ished* out by the **hook**, with your Hand, and catch it with your **8**eing.  Let everything you remember surround you, the memory of touch, sight, sound, vibration, thought, Love, Time, let them wrap around and in and Hear your **V**oice of voices **C**all your **W**ord (or *tooth*), and become the Memory of that Moment of **L**ove, again.  Can you remember, **Everything**?  *Practice until you can and do.*  Can you do it, **Y**et?

&#x200B;

**Good.**

&#x200B;

Last step, write the equivalency of these words in your own words (but skip the ""*words*"" part) in your Mind: ""*IF, I cannot think of anything new, THEN, Pikachu.*""  Give your self that **C**ommand, and put it into your **Mem-**ory and Imagination.  Paint those words over every frame of each, on the **w**alls of the Tunnels, and on the back **w**all of your Mind.  Did you do it?

&#x200B;

**Good.  Congratulations, you've saved your Game.  Progress saved. Ready to try fighting the next Boss again.**

&#x200B;

The next time you die, all you have to do is form your **hook** using emotion when you can't think in words, so you can think: **Pikachu**, and you will be back in your **Memory with Love,** *with* the Memories you made *after* it, but able to, from there, think of something **New... in a new Branch,** and continue your **Line**.

&#x200B;

You do this all the (*time?*), but do not re-**mem**\-ber in completion, because you haven't learned how to use your Water, **Y**et.  That's not your fault though, someone [Tooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_alphabet)ed it.  Wanna know how?  Note the two Phoenician **O**'s in ""G**oo**d"" and take one of them **o**ut.

0,ahghx1,1,26,"Child of God, you were created to create the good, the beautiful and the holy. Do not forget this.

God is not partial. All His children have His total Love, and all His gifts are freely given to everyone alike.

The power to work miracles belongs to you.

It should especially be noted that God has only one Son. If all His creations are His Sons, every one must be an integral part of the whole Sonship. The Sonship in its Oneness transcends the sum of its parts.

To extend is a fundamental aspect of God which He gave to His Son. In the creation, God extended Himself to His creations and imbued them with the same loving Will to create. You have not only been fully created, but have also been created perfect. There is no emptiness in you. 

Because of your likeness to your Creator you are creative. No child of God can lose this ability because it is inherent in what he is, but he can use it inappropriately by projecting. The inappropriate use of extension, or projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth.

Attack is always physical. When attack in any form enters your mind you are equating yourself with a body, since this is the ego’s interpretation of the body. You do not have to attack physically to accept this interpretation. You are accepting it simply by the belief that attack can get you something you want. 

If you did not believe this, the idea of attack would have no appeal for you. When you equate yourself with a body you will always experience depression. When a child of God thinks of himself in this way he is belittling himself, and seeing his brothers as similarly belittled. Since he can find himself only in them, he has cut himself off from salvation.

When you are sad, know this need not be. Depression comes from a sense of being deprived of something you want and do not have. Remember that you are deprived of nothing except by your own decisions, and then decide otherwise.

While you feel guilty your ego is in command, because only the ego can experience guilt. This need not be.

When you are anxious, realize that anxiety comes from the capriciousness of the ego, and know this need not be.

All things work together for good. There are no exceptions except in the ego’s judgment.

The ego has built a shabby and unsheltering home for you, because it cannot build otherwise. Do not try to make this impoverished house stand. Its weakness is your strength. 

Only God could make a home that is worthy of His creations, who have chosen to leave it empty by their own dispossession. Yet His home will stand forever, and is ready for you when you choose to enter it. Of this you can be wholly certain. God is as incapable of creating the perishable as the ego is of making the eternal.

0,aherxn,2,8,"Hey all, wondering if anyone can give me some insight or if any of you have experienced something similar. When this thing happens to me I call it anxiety due to the skin crawling discomfort, but it isnt much like regular anxiety either. I'm not worrying about anything when it happens, there's no fear or concern, just an odd mental pain that sets my jaw on edge and forces me to pace or jump around uncomfortably.

I've had these ""attacks"" only a handful of times over the years, but they're distinct due to their mysterious nature and severity. Basically, they start when I am dreaming and move into reality as I wake up.

Now, I'm no stranger to bad dreams. Running away from stuff that wants to rip me apart is just a Tuesday nights good dream to me, so this is something else, and I really have no idea why it affects me how it does.

The dreams always seem to have a mathematical component, which is hard to explain. The most recent example I can cite before last night's one was that I had fallen asleep, 9 years ago, and I was in a place where I had no body or form, I was just a mind. I saw a circle on a contrasting background and thought ""oh, one."" Then the circle divided and I thought ""oh, two"". Then it divided again and again, and I tried so hard to keep up, I'd be there, frantic, ""uhhhh 16.....uhhhh 32? Wait! 64!! Stop I can't count that high!"" These were all voiceless thoughts, and the division sped up and sped up until it was impossible to count them all. I had an overwhelming sense of urgency that if I didn't keep track of the numbers, terrible things would happen. Eventually the circles started coming back into themselves, lowering their numbers and I tried to catch on again and follow the pattern, down until they were just one. Then, with barely a moment to relax, the process would start over. It was torturous, and lasted what felt like hours, with no escape from the urgency of counting and no improvement in my ability to keep track, no matter how many times we repeated it.

I woke up after that in a terribly heightened anxious state, I was delirious from crying and my skin felt like it was covered in ants, it felt like my bones hurt and nothing was right in the world, that nothing could ever be right.

I have had a few of these before this example, and always just took to calling them math dreams.

Last night I was struck with another, for no reason that I could tell. It was a bit different (they always are), and I remember next to nothing about what went on in the dream itself, but I woke up in that heightened mode, skin crawling, everything painful in a non-physical way. This time, the torment came from everything around me, particularly my body, having an acute sense of *wrongness* that I couldn't explain. I touched my hair, noticing that not all the strands of it were the exact same length, and this struck me like a blow. Everything about reality was asymmetrical, uneven, and for some reason it was torture for me. I wanted so badly to unzip my skin and become **right**. It felt like my mind was a fractal pattern barely constrained by my skull and if I could just split it open I would emerge and be free of all this pain and discomfort and imperfection that was torturing me.


Anyway, I took an ativan, paced around for awhile, opened my window to the morning sun, listened to relaxing music and did deep breathing until I fell asleep. Woke up now with just the memory of the experience, I don't feel the pain actively now.

This is a semi-regular event for me, have any of you experienced something similar? If so, how do you deal with it?",new,Painful strange anxiety coming out of dream,8
0,ahe4cc,4,30," 

One of the things that give me the most energy and willingness to get up and take action each day and take care of my self is belief that my dreams can come true. That whatever I have a burning desire for, it is possible to attain. For many, they have a desire, maybe a burning desire that they cannot stop thinking about, but they more than likely are told it is not possible or they do not believe that they can experience whatever it is they desire. The moment this happens, it is like pouring a bucket of water on the fire. Doubt, worry, and overall insecurity completely immobilizes people, they stop doing what it takes to get what they want. They lose excitement for life, and worst of all, they settle for what's ""realistic"".

I'm not telling you how to be successful. I'm just telling you that the life of your dreams, and I mean what you desire with all of your heart, is possible. I'm also saying that we might as well try, we might as well take a chance on faith. Waking up each day, with a goal or dream that excites me, that I believe in, and going to bed knowing I am closer to this goal than I was when I woke up, is really amazing. It makes me feel like my life is moving, that I am growing, that I have a reason to be here, it makes me happy. So please, if you don't think you can make music, or dance, or paint, or whatever it is, just begin now and decide to give yourself a little bit of faith, trust yourself, believe in yourself, you are worth it. 

Best of all, if you fail, it will never matter, because the way there is the most important part. I am not excited about achieving my goals, I'm excited about every day, every step it will take. I'm excited to see this story unfold in unexpected ways, and I open to everything that might come.

I hope this provided some insight and perspective. Thank you all so much!

In my attempt to understand this reality and ""life"" the past year, I've also come across a message and ""story"" throughout all the films I've watched.  

These 2 films are about the yin/yang energy inside all of us and what I discovered in my own ascension process.  This is my attempt to visually describe and inform others of the dark (PT I) & the light (PT II) existing inside of us and our reality.  Earth is a school and in order to graduate, we must ascend our consciousness.  These films are my attempt at conveying the meaning of life and enlightenment.

Learn not to fight with others, but fight the duality within and become a warrior.

Earth = Heart
This is a school of self, to overcome the self.
You are a child dreaming in your own dream, your own movie.

When you find peace within, your reality will change.

0,ah19h1,3,5,"Every moment of your life is a time to celebrate. A moment to appreciate the wonderful things in life, to appreciate the beauty everywhere, to love yourself, to love others, to express your thanks for everything you are lucky to have and be a part of. I sound like a blind optimist, but I am simply making a choice. A choice to wake up every morning and remember what I want, to be happy. 

&#x200B;

When you’re caught up in a negative thought pattern that is causing you sadness or anxiety, notice you are forgetting the simple fact that all you want is to be happy, the details do not matter. When you’re arguing with someone, ask yourself: would I rather be right or happy? When you are overthinking ask yourself: would I rather be stressed or happy? What do I want? The human mind needs direction, and most the time we are on autopilot, just letting thoughts run wild and we follow these thoughts wherever they go. But when you say: I want to be happy. You give yourself direction, you start gravitating towards happy, more positive thoughts, you take actions necessary to be happy. 

&#x200B;

Before you know it, after years of this, you will become the kind of person that is able to turn negatives into positives, to find the good thing in a seemingly terrible circumstance. Let’s all choose to be happy, to be grateful, to be excited about life. We may not know how this can be done, but let’s just make the choice and clearly remind ourselves as often as possible that we want happiness. We don’t want cars, clothes, money, attention, or any of these worldly things, we just want happiness. We are open to whatever might bring happiness into our lives and we are no longer attached to the specifics, to the details. 

&#x200B;

I’ll end with this, I remember hearing that depression or sadness comes from wanting to be happy, but EXPECTING it to come from a specific thing or person or circumstance. Do not attach yourself to an expectation. This will drive you mad. Just be happy because you want it! Go and celebrate! Let loose! Learn! Soon you will find that happiness is much simpler than you’d think. It is here now, inside, ready to come out! It is our natural state, it feels comfortable, it feels like home. I love you and I hope that you can celebrate every moment of your life.

Societal Engineering is a seven-part series based on the works of the late Jacque Fresco — who provides a solution to the world’s problems. This series will be a psychological and sociological breakdown of human societies, in particular, our society. Showcasing how all systems presented to humanity are not only detrimental to the longevity of the balance of nature, but detrimental to the longevity of humanity. Providing alternative solutions to the world’s problems such as new social paradigms which render war & divisions obsolete. Free-clean electricity, a resource based economy, a revamped education system and better ways to raise children. All to pave the way to a future that is something similar to what we see in Star Trek.

# Jacque Fresco:

>*Jacque Fresco’s background includes industrial design and social engineering, as well as being a forerunner in the field of Human Factors. Mr. Fresco worked as both designer and inventor in a wide range of fields spanning from biomedical innovations to totally integrated social systems.*  
*The Venus Project reflects the culmination of Mr. Fresco’s life work: the integration of the best of science and technology into a comprehensive plan for a new society based on human and environmental concern. It is a global vision of hope for the future of humankind in our technological age.*  
*Mr. Fresco was a guest lecturer at many institutions of higher learning. He addressed students at the University of Miami, Princeton, University of Southern California, Dade Junior College, Queens College, Presbyterian College, University of Southern Florida, Nichols College, Columbia University, Instituto Tecnologico de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey in Monterrey of Mexico, Institute of Technology in Vienna, Austria, Penn State Greater Allegheny, Nova Southeastern University, City London University, University of Michigan, and others. He and Ralph Nader were featured guest lecturers at the University of South Florida. At Princeton University, Mr. Fresco addressed the Department of Sociology. His subject was Sociology of the Future. Along with the well-known anthropologist Margaret Mead, Mr. Fresco was extended an invitation to address the College Environment Conference in Washington, DC. He was a guest speaker for the Tenth Symposium for the Civil Engineering Department of TEC de Monterrey University in Monterrey, Mexico, Latin America’s top rated college.*  
*Mr. Fresco was a guest speaker at The Utopian Studies Conference in Orlando, FL and lectured at several World Future Society Conferences.*  
*He was also guest speaker at a conference in Iceland and the guest of honor at The Futurists Summit 2008 in Istanbul, Turkey, as well as many other conferences, such as the Futurist Convention, Global Sciences Conference, the Future By Design’s Transitions ’96 Conference, and the Global Cleansweep and Solarsweep forum in Florida. He was a guest lecturer on future planning in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, at the Technical University in Vienna, and at the conference at Dalian, China for the Development of N.E. China, as well as a conference at Abuja in Nigeria for the revitalization of its informal sector. Over the years, Mr. Fresco has also delivered lectures to numerous civic groups and various other organizations, such as B’nai B’rith of Los Angeles (CA) and Miami (FL), Mensa of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society, the Humanist Society, the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara (CA), the Spinoza Outdoor Forum of Miami (FL), Unitarian Universalist Church in Daytona (FL), and others. In recent years, he delivered lectures at COP Kreativ, Copenhagen, Denmark; City London University, London, UK; and El Salvador, San Salvador. He was awarded the 2009 International Design Award from a! Diseño and lectured at their Life Loves Design conference in Ixtapa, Mexico. In 2009 and 2010 Fresco addressed supporters at the annual Z-Day event in New York. In 2010, he began a World Lecture Tour in which he presented over 26 lectures in 20 countries. It was very well received. In 2011, Mr. Fresco addressed the public for Occupy Miami at Government Center in Miami. In 2012, he was honored at* [*Sustainatopia*](https://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/235325) *in Miami. In September 2012, Fresco addressed supporters in Banja Luka, Bosnia, and the Galactic Citizenship Conference in St. Petersburg, Russia. He also addressed the audience at the New Jack City Festival. In July 2016, less than a year before his death, the United Nations bestowed an award for* [*City Design & Community*](https://www.thevenusproject.com/?p=5043)*. In early 2017, Florida’s Baker Museum of Artis—Naples honored Fresco’s life by featuring a five-month exhibit called “Jacque Fresco: 100 Years of Vision” consisting of a timeline chronicling Fresco’s life and work, curated by* [*Silvia Perea*](https://www.thevenusproject.com/?p=6318)*.*  
*We have all heard lectures that downgrade the present state of affairs. They speak of such social problems as lawlessness, poverty, racial tension and divorce. But how many of us can recall any of these lectures offering creative solutions to these problems? Mr. Fresco’s presentations reflect a serious attempt to illuminate the causes and outline a wide range of constructive alternatives. He did this by presenting a redesign of our culture, one that would emphasize the intelligent use of science and technology to enhance the lives of all people while protecting our environment. His subjects range from “New Dimensions in Human Stupidity” to “Imagineering The Future.” A video often accompanies the lectures where his ideas are vividly brought to life through animated models, illustrations and computer animation.*  
*His particular lecture technique enables uninformed audiences to grasp the significance of complex social and technical issues through his use of analogy, example, and anecdote. He speaks dramatically and passionately about the urgent transitional problems facing our contemporary society. His audiences find their attention focused closely on the words of Mr. Fresco from brilliant beginning to profound end. Mr. Fresco’s lectures have consistently been received with praise and enthusiasm.*  
*Mr. Fresco was the founder of Sociocyberneering, Inc., now known as the Venus Project. With his associate Roxanne Meadows, he designed and built the entire twenty-five acre research facility. The function of this project is to prepare approaches and solutions to the major problems that confront the world today. Television, newspaper, and magazine coverage on the project has been worldwide.*

*Jacque Fresco died on May 18th, 2017.*

you graduate high school and college, full honors

you spend all your time with doctors and scholars 

forsaking your brothers in favor of dollars

befriending the rich and tax-men (I mean, robbers)

you do all things you’re “supposed to” and win

prizes of all prices in this hologram we’re in



but one day you die, as all of us do

unfortunately missing all of the clues

as hard as you tried, you eventually lose

because money can’t hide you when your time is through



you open your eyes in a world yet unknown

you see no one around, but know you’re not alone

you hear through the ether 

“for your sins you‘ll atone”



thoughts race through your mind

“is this God? is it Time? some sort of Fate with strings that it winds?”

but you know in your soul who this voice belongs to

not some outside deity, to no one but you



you suddenly realize the time that you’ve wasted

the others you’ve hurt because you were so jaded

the war and the famine and hatred you’ve aided

the hell that you’ve caused on your land, once sacred



sobs from a heart filled with guilt pierce the void

you ask for forgiveness but your Light is destroyed 

all the success that your body enjoyed 

truly did nothing but help you avoid

the Truth in the patterns placed in the cracks

you blew out all the lanterns, ignored all the flags



you placed more importance on what was “in fashion” 

than loving your brothers and showing compassion

you abandoned your sisters for quick satisfaction

and never gave thought to your repulsive actions



you want to go back but you know it’s too late

so, on your knees, you beg for a clean slate

you see a bright flash as you pass through the gate

and you swear that this time you’ll get it all straight

the oversoul voice that is you starts to fade

as through oceans and forests of ether you wade



breaking through into this 3d is hard

and when you finally make it, battered and scarred

you’ve lost parts of your Light, memories torn apart

but you got what you wanted

you got to restart



it’s still up you to realize your worth

to endure the temptation 

and worldly allure

your task is not simple, that we’ll admit

but it would not have been bestowed if you were unfit


a god is inside you just waiting for freedom

let the Light in your soul shine like a beacon

so one day you ascend, uncondemned

0,agrapk,19,3,"This is Ashtar Sheran and this message is an update on the war against the darkside on your planet Shan the light forces have your earth surrounded. Many see our ships, we are overtaking dark bases to liberate hostages there and to claim these bases as future spaceports for the light full-disclosure will unveil them to you. The Fiat monetary system is all but bust, the Cabal are being arrested there are many indictments and preparations are being made at Guantanamo Bay to house them until galactic trial. All of the cabal’s leaders are being arrested, the Clintons, the Bush’s, the Obama’s, and more will soon stand trial for high treason and for many more crimes, not the least of which are human trafficking, narcotics rings, murder the list goes on and on.
  
These criminals have had their day, we watch as they sweat attempting to murder more of the prosecution’s witnesses, these people are in our care now no more “suiciding,” will be tolerated. This is crunch time as you call it, this is the epicenter of the battle right now in this moment you are living it. We need you to stay strong the dark knows it’s time is up and is fighting to win back its control over your planet. You did expect that, didn’t you? You did expect that they would use the last of their power to create new campaigns to put you back under the ether? If you didn’t then you don’t understand the importance of their control over YOU. How pivotal those on Earth are to their entire regime, the lies the disinformation the false accusations against the light specifically.
  
They fear us, the Delta forces have come to your planet and are working in the background to help liberate YOU. Any messages of them disrupting your cities are UNTRUE. Their lies there are rumors circulating that there will be no RV that is nonsense the RV has already begun the decline of the American dollar is part of that. We have a sting operation going to ferret out the last of the Cabal members who think to thwart a new quantum financial system that is why the date is being reset over and over and over again. Each time we capture more of these criminals, why do you think there are so many indictments with more increasing as time progresses?
  
We are bringing down their control system right in front of the eyes of the aware, but behind the backs of the unaware it is a delicate operation. Become aware, understand and do not panic when you see videos posts blogs articles saying the entire operation has been shelved. Do not listen, do not give these liars your energy, do not worry. When you doubt and begin to worry YOU FEED THE DARK. Do not give them your energy. Enough information has been published to explain the process, we are adhering to this process anyone who says that anything has changed at all is lying. It is disinformation. These dark workers are working overtime to sway your thinking, do not let them, the plan is in place it has been for many of your years. It is a plan that works, it will not fail and we will not fail you, but you must believe in a faith.  
  
Know also that the dark is attempting to reach you through your own MINDS, Sharon has had many reports of dark attempts to separate light workers from each other, be it in creating doubt in their loyalty to Sharon leaving her group or attempting to create quarreling between them. You must know that Sharon works directly under me she is loyal to the light and has the liberation of humanity on earth in her heart, she is unwavering in her commitment to see this through we ask no less of you. Know that doubt is your enemy, the enemy the dark tries to create within you. That doubt is its voice, all is well. The world will go through growing pains as you change but that is to be expected, you will be weaned off your dependency on money via the new quantum financial system.  
  
The plan is to give all on earth enough money to be financially independent, there will be no more suffering and this will allow you to outgrow your need of it. It may seem ironic to you that giving you more will, we knew of your dependency however we know that your lack of money keeps you dependent upon it and in your nefarious financial system, lack creates more lack, greed and suffering. This will end for you and soon, this is the Divine Plan. You are part of the Divine Plan, do not give yourselves over to the dark any longer, the dark is dying, it has lost any last-ditch efforts to keep the illusion alive.  Do not support them with your energy, understand that they were attempting to trick you before but the closer we move to final victory, the worse their trickery will become for you. We apologise but it is simply a question of not listening to it stay in your light.

Rediscovering who you are is a lovely process in becoming your greatest version. I say this because when you're living in alignment with you're higher, authentic self, everything in life becomes effortless. Not only that, you reach a point where you are no longer trying to get somewhere that you're not. You're complete and there are no more doubts, questions, insecurities, and fears. You are now living the human experience you came here for. 

1 - Establish what you are not.

You will notice that there are sometimes feelings of guilt, shame, sadness that come up when you are straying away from your authentic lifestyle. I specifically went through a period of guilt recently when I had hurt a friend emotionally without intending to, my actions were not aligned with my purpose, actually the opposite. So I was met with a deep resentment towards myself and it felt awful. I realized then and there that this was not in alignment with who I really am and so I learned to be more present and realize when I am about to take an action that does not serve my higher purpose. Doing this has accelerated my growth considerably.

2 - Quiet the mind

Human beings think on average, 60 thousand thoughts each day. The mind is a loud and messy place for most of us. If we learn to meditate or be present, and still, we can open the floodgates for our authentic selves to flow through.

3 - Follow your bliss

Once you've figured a bunch of actions and lifestyles that are out of alignment with who you are, you're now ready to rediscover what lifestyle is right for you. By lifestyle, I mean the way in which you carry yourself, treat others, create, build, your rules, your outlook, your ""way of life"" so to speak. So follow what you feel in your heart makes you happy, at peace, joyful and excited. So long as it does not interfere with others living their purpose, you will naturally gravitate towards the alignment we are talking about.

4 - Being you is effortless

On the topic of natural gravitation, you will come to realize that once you are open, willing to change, aware enough to make the distinctions we are talking about, you will simply gravitate towards what is right for you. The right people will show up, the right circumstances will guide you towards the path that is right for you. Just have trust in the process and live each moment with absolute gratitude and presence. You're doing wonderfully and you should be proud of yourself! Let's enjoy, shall we?

David Bowie plays Nikola Tesla in the Johnathon Nolan film the Prestige.



https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Christopher-Nolan-Begged-David-Bowie-Star-Prestige-106927.html


Nolan Begged Bowie to play the role of Nikola Tesla 


“Tesla was this other-worldly, ahead-of-his-time figure, and at some point it occurred to me he was the original Man Who Fell to Earth. As someone who was the biggest Bowie fan in the world, once I made that connection, he seemed to be the only actor capable of playing the part. He had that requisite iconic status, and he was a figure as mysterious as Tesla needed to be. It took me a while to convince him, though—he turned down the part the first time. It was the only time I can ever remember trying again with an actor who passed on me. “


Had Nolan not been as insistent then This sync chain may not exist the same way.


https://i.imgur.com/vd3u2to.jpg


I have already experienced a stunning sync chain involving Kanye and Bowie and this ties in quite elegantly with the previous facets of reality that have been revealed. 


To give a synopsis. David Bowie releases “Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from MARS” 5 years and 2 days from the birth of Kanye West.  The weird thing is that the album cover has Bowie sitting under a sign that says K WEST........ And the first song on the album is titled  FIVE YEARS.


This album was released on Tupacs 1st  Birthday and Tupac's mother was born 2 days exactly after David Bowie


Davids birthday encodes his year of death in that 1x8x1x9x4x7=2016


In another post I learned that 11111 days = 365 months.............. I found it odd that the number of days in a year in months=repeating 1's when converted to days.


In addition to all of that there is a convergence with David and Kanye in another way.

I found an injured chicken in my yard yesterday. The night before I had heard fox noises, but I didn't know anyone had chickens so I assumed I was only hearing fox noises. So of course when I saw the chicken the next morning I knew what happened, but not where the chicken came from. I picked him up, got him sheltered and warming, went to town and got bird seed so he could eat. Thankfully by the end of the day we found out that my neighbor that works at a nursing home brought them to her home for the rest of the cold weather season. They had gotten out of their temporary pen and, of course, was being hunted by a fox(es). She found all of them but one.

Today I found the last one. It didn't make it. In spite of the fact that I found one alive and rescued it, knowing I couldn't help this one chicken just... hurts. They're not even my responsibility, but all the logic and reasoning just gets overshadowed by the sorrow and feelings of failure I have for the dead chicken.

The hell of it all is that the one I found alive, I was led to. The hawks that nest in one of my giant oak trees did their strange call that as far as I can tell they only use to communicate with me (I did a bunch of research on hawk calls and I couldn't find this particular call). They got my attention and pointed their heads/beaks in the direction of the chicken that I was able to rescue. Nothing led me to the chicken that died until it had already been dead for about a day. My dogs had found it, brought it up, and started barking outside my window to call me down to show me.

0,ageese,11,37,"Hello everyone here at this cosmic /r/SoulNexus hub,

We in the moderation team have added a new rule to our sidebar for new and existing posts. It reads as follows:

>***Rule #10:*** *Posts that attempt to solicit money from SoulNexus readers will be removed at Moderator discretion.*

We instituted Rule #10 with the goal to minimize posts that solicit visitors to, for example, donate money to the OP's GoFundMe/Patreon page or something along those lines. We will also likely remove posts in which the OP writes out a call-to-action for SoulNexus readers to donate to their specific blog, initiative, practice, or endeavor. 

>*(OP = reddit parlance that means ""Original Poster,"" referring to the person who created the post).*

We understand that there are many who visit SoulNexus who have practices and vocations that relate to this subreddit's subject matter such as Reiki practitioners, Tarot readers, Akashic readers, QHHT therapists etc. It is exciting to discover new practitioners and we are happy to see when visitors synchronistically connect with a practitioner at SoulNexus and then subsequently go on to engage in a session of some type. We do not have an issue with people making connections with each other at /r/SoulNexus. In fact, if someone creates a post that solicits recommendations for a good reader/practitioner of some type, you will see that commenters often post links to practitioners that resonate with them. Often, those recommended practitioners will likely have a fee structure of some type. This type of communication is not an issue. Moderators won't remove posts/comments that seek and share recommendations.

Visitors to SoulNexus also tend to enjoy posts that showcase the creative work of an OP's new initiative, or art, or endeavor, or podcast episode, or YouTube video, or what-have-you. So if someone clicks on your blog post and there happens to be a donation call-to-action somewhere on the page... or if at the end of your video, you mention your GoFundMe/Patreon/whatever--that is fine and our Moderation team will not deem it as cause for post removal.

At the end of the day, we do not want to host posts at /r/SoulNexus that explicitly petition readers and visitors to send them money, even if the cause is seemingly exciting or noble. 

If you have questions or request clarification, please leave a comment here or message us via the ""ModMail"" function. Thank you!

0,agdu5e,14,6,"this happened over 6 months ago but I remember it like it happened today. 

I found myself walking around in what I can only describe as reminiscent of an M.C. Escher painting. items floating around like there was no gravity, impossible staircases, colors swirling through ether. it felt like I had just been blacked out (not passed out but blacked out like I couldn’t remember what just happened) and I was just coming to a point that I could begin to remember things again. after a while I came across two figures, one male and one female, although they had no features suggesting this, I just knew they were. they looked perfectly fine, if quite a bit alien. they were tall and slender, very pale, with very light skin and eyes. the male figure told me that I wasn’t dreaming and that I could do whatever I wanted with no limits. so, I tried it. I tried to turn myself into a basketball and it worked. I tried to manipulate time and it worked. it was like something clicked in my head when I realized that what he said was true. I wasn’t dreaming and I could do anything I could think of. my mind went crazy with possibilities. this figure suddenly began to shed it skin, revealing a very malicious feeling presence with thick, red, charred skin and horns that curled like a goat’s. it stared at me with a horrific grin on it’s face. it felt as if it was saying, “I finally got you”. I panicked. I tried to get out of it, to “stop dreaming” but I wasn’t dreaming. I kept telling myself it was a dream even though it didn’t feel like one but no matter what I did I couldn’t “wake up”. I was trapped. I don’t know what happened next.

I woke up in my bed in a cold sweat, crying and terrified. I’ve never had sleep apnea or paralysis and nothing like this has happened since. you can read my account of the recurring dream I had as a child involving what I called for a long time “the red light aliens” [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/acqkav/a_recurring_dream_i_had_as_a_child/) (this account is slightly altered for a less esoteric crowd.)

First being surrounded by complete darkness and then finding myself drowning in nothing. At the start I struggled for air and then I realized I had no reason to struggle seeing as how I could breathe freely. To me I felt an indescribable peace. 

I remember telling someone who was a good friend about my experience and he did not share my understanding of it, though he instead sympathized. To him he thought it must have been a traumatic experience- when in reality, to me, was the exact opposite. I since then have experienced the void twice accumulating a total of three visits there.

On August 19th, 2018, I started a new journal. I had journaled in the past, but at this point, I was determined to do some real inner work. To understand my patterns, and to write down my problems and get to the bottom of it. This worked incredibly well at first. I was really beginning to take more action in my life, writing down my goals, the things that I must avoid, and my to-do's. Soon though, it became an outlet for me to vent about so-called ""problems"". My ego, this part of the human mind that wants power, attention, praise, individuality, and separateness, now had an outlet, a voice, a way of expressing its needs and desires. This was out of control. I would frantically write pages upon pages of nonsense. Of things that do not matter to my authentic self. Things like: I should be in a relationship, I am alone, I am bored, I am afraid, no one understands me, here's why this person is wrong, etc. I continued to do this for over 120 days, I filled the entire journal up with words, details, stuff, so much stuff.

&#x200B;

This was not a healthy way to grow, for me at least. It actually led me to feel like I was going crazy. I was thinking so hard about why I wasn't happy, so I would then create stories and ideas that have nothing to do with true happiness. The answer was so simple, but the mind can't handle simplicity.

&#x200B;

Living a life you enjoy is a much simpler equation than you'd think. In fact, it's beyond thought itself. Thought is the one thing that is creating the suffering in your life. Thought, in this context is the meaning you give to the circumstances of your life. How can there be a human being who seemingly has nothing to live for, living in absolute poverty who is happier than someone who has a relationship, money, friends, and opportunities? The answer is the meaning the human has given to these situations. You have all the happiness, peace, love, and joy you could ever ask for, within you right now!  


You can decide, wherever you are, to be here in the present moment and appreciate life, accept life, and be happy. You really have that power, and if you don't believe you can do this, then you are still trapped in your thoughts of the past, of the future, of the way life ""should"" be.   
Ignore the details, details don't matter, the past doesn't exist, the future has endless possibilities, but the present moment is real, it's everything you have. So, forget about the details, you don't need to add anything to your life. There is no joy out there that can ever fulfill you as much as the joy within. Let's all love one another, love ourselves, love our life, now. 

&#x200B;

So I have stopped journaling because I have found my peace, joy, happiness, and even productivity, discipline and focus in the present moment. I do write things down, but I'm no longer dwelling in the mind. 

&#x200B;

I really hope this has helped someone, and I just want to say that this is my experience, if journaling is helping you, which for most it does. then I am in no way suggesting you stop. Just be here now, I love you all.

Well it’s the same thing with your mind. You dig deeper and you realize that ‘damn, I did not know how shitty I feel about my own self?’ All the hatred, the unwholesome state of mind that is holding you back from loving self.

You are born, not an individual, but an infinity of individuals, in an infinity of identical worlds. “Consciousness,” your individual awareness, is shared by this infinity of beings.

At birth (or at conception), this span of selves begins to divide, as alternate possibilities are indulged or rejected. The infant turns his head not to the left or to the right, but both. One infinity of worlds becomes two; then four; then eight, and so on, exponentially.

But the underlying essence of consciousness continues to connect all these disparate possibilities.

The upshot?

You cannot die.

Consider. Suppose, tomorrow afternoon, you walk in front of a speeding eighteen-wheeler. The grillwork snaps your neck and what remains of you is sausaged under the chassis. Do you die? Well, yes; an infinity of you does die; but infinity is divisible by itself. Another infinity of you steps out of the path of the truck, or didn’t leave the house that day, or recovers in the hospital. The youness of you doesn’t die; it simply continues to reside in those remnant selves.

An infinite set has been subtracted from infinity; but what remains, remains infinite.

The subjective experience is that the accident simply doesn’t happen.

By definition, you can’t experience your own death. 

Death is the end of consciousness. And consciousness persists. In the language of physics, consciousness is conserved.

I am the one who wakes up in the morning.

Always.

Every morning.

I don’t die.

First, the [moon](https://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Space-Station-Moon.jpg) maintains a nearly-perfect circular orbit.  No planetary model can adequately explain how that occurred whether it originated from the earth, the solar system or from outside the solar system.  The best, and currently accepted model, is called the Orpheus Theory, which states that the [Moon](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PSsFrboGA94/VDFai87puoI/AAAAAAAAYAc/ewdqsYmGBko/s1600/Alien%2Baliens%2BET%2BUFO%2BUFOs%2Bsighting%2Bsightings%2BLady%2BGaga%2Bnews%2BJustin%2BBieber%2Bpolitics%2Bparanormal%2BCanada%2Btech%2Bcloak%2Bcalifornia%2Bgold%2Btop%2Bsecret%2Bnasa1.png) came into being as a result of a collision of two planetary bodies, one being the earth, the other a rogue planet. 

However, it leaves Earth with an excessive angularmomentum. 

From the **[Sumerian Creation Tablets](http://www.awaken-consciousness.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Sumerian-clay-tablets.jpg)** it was written that two moons of a rogue planet called Nibiru smacked into **Tiamat (the primordial Earth).**  From that collision the Earth and Asteroid Belt were produced. Our Moon was already a satellite of Tiamat and was attracted to the largest remaining fragment.  Other reports state that our moon came from another planet called Maldek (Malona) which was destroyed during the Great Galactic War. 

**The asteroid belt is all that remains of that planet as well as a portion of [Tiamat.](https://conspiracydailyupdate.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/the2bexploded2bplanet2bhypothesis2bthe2bdestruction2bof2btiamat2belectra2bmaldek2band2bthe2bcreation2bof2bthe2basteroid2bbelt.png?w=400&h=372&crop=1)**

(All the labels are slowly coming together now yes?)

Second, the moon is 27.322% of the Earth’s size. The Moon rotates around the Earth once every 27.322 days. A coincidence? 

Third, it maintains an orbit and rotational period which are exactly the same. We never see the other side from the prospective of an earth-bound observer. 

Fourth, the distance from the earth to the moon is 1/400th the distance from the earth to the sun and the diameter of the moon is 1/400 the diameter of the sun. The Moon and the sun are the 
same size from the perspective of an earth-bound observer (and only an earth-bound observer). 

Fifth, using any unit of measure, multiply the earth circumference by the moon circumference and divide by 100 and you get the sun circumference. 

Sixth, the Moon circumference is 10,920.8 km and it turns once every 27.322 Earth days which means the Moon is rotating at 400 km/d. 

The Earth is rotating at 40,000 km/d.   The ratio is 100:1.  ... another coincidence? 

Seventh, there are 109.2 Earth diameters to one Sun diameter, there are also 109.2 Sun diameters to the diameter of the Earth orbit at aphelion and the circumference of the Moon is 109.2 x 100 
kilometers.  Another another  coincidence? 

Eighth, the largest craters on the Moon are convex instead of concave and are far too shallow for 
meteor impacts. There is a shell below the surface that is not penetrated. 

Ninth, the Moon precisely imitates the annual movements of the Sun from the perspective of the earth-bound observer. When the Sun is at its lowest position in the sky on December 21st the Moon is at its highest, and when the Sun is at its highest on June 21st, the Moon is at its lowest and at the equinoxes their positions are identical.

The respective high and low positions from the perspective of the earth-bound observer are also identical in magnitude and they also rise and set at precisely the same location on the horizon.

*The gravitational influence and reciprocalmovement of the Sun and Moon are identical.*

     “The best explanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon does not exist.”

0,ag1wzm,13,11," Why are you alive? 

  
This was the question of the summer, my friend and I were looking within to the core of our being. Not how are we here, but why? Why do we continue to do the things we do? We have one go at this human life, there are many paths we can choose, which one resonates with us? What does life mean to us? We honestly drove ourselves a little crazy with these questions, because the answer is usually much simpler than you think.  


For me, when I ask these questions, when I contemplate the fact that this human life will come to an end, I feel empowered and excited. I begin first with listing my favorite things about this life, and my favorite memories. This gives an idea at what my heart gravitates towards. But the answer to that question ""Why am I alive?"" still felt so distant. Then I realized that it is a much simpler answer, and there are two parts.   
First, it is not for me to understand fully why I am here until the unfolding has taken place, until I am at the end of this life, looking back from that perspective. At that point, I will realize that everything had to take place the way it did.  


Second, for me personally, I am here to end suffering in any conscious being I can and enjoy myself along the way. I love spreading positivity, I love laughing, I love hugging and spending quality time with others, I am an absolute people person, I want nothing more than to help others feel wonderful about everything. But I also love fun, play, adventure, traveling, video games and so on. I can just help all the time, I want to play around here as well.   
So that was the answer, 6 months in the making, I drove myself to insanity and back trying to answer it. But it was almost as if it was so obvious but there was too much resistance, too much noise for me to see it. So sit, quiet your mind, have fun, relax, stop taking life and yourself so seriously, stop expecting, just accept and this will pave the way to you answering that question and getting excited about living this life.  


Hope this helps:)

It was their intervention that triggered the destruction of Lemuria, the destruction of Atlantis and the entire world civilization. Through it all, it still didn’t sink into the Pleiadian rebels what they were doing to mankind.  In the period 1500 B.C. through 1200 B.C. the renegade Pleiadians were forced to withdraw from direct intervention by the main defense forces of the Pleiadian Star League.  *This finally brought the “reign of terror” to an end.*

**This planted the seeds of spiritual** [**consciousness**](https://img00.deviantart.net/8af2/i/2015/124/6/9/earth_guardian_by_cearafinn-d1r9uzn.jpg)

Other attempts to bring back the Sirian/Lemurian style governance included Noah and   the Hebrews. Noah didn’t get very far and after the Exodus; the Hebrews instituted the concept of Judges to bring the people a concept of a society led by spiritual beings.

However, these attempts  failed because the human psyche was not ready for it and it was decided that planting the idea of a Christ consciousness would grow into the human psyche over thousands of years and be ultimately  successful.

Beecause of the destruction of the Firmament, a significant amount of damaging radiation has been allowed to hit the planet surface.  This causes a disastrous effect on all living things. There was no reasonable chance that humans would be able to survive over the long term independent of outside support with their spiritual selves disconnected.

**Most humans don’t know that their primary mission on the planet is to be a guardian of the planet; that without their conscious support of the biosphere in concert with the cetaceans, all life on the planet falls apart, literally.**

The only thing that’s still holding it together right now is the cetaceans and the Spiritual Hierarchy.

**A guardian is one who brings in the energies of creation and regulates them for the biosphere.**

The Earth land guardian is [**man**](https://ccwe.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/vesica-piscis-3.jpg)

It is a very unique process whereby the creative life energies given by the Spiritual Hierarchy are physically transmuted into maintenance life energies.

**Chanting, singing, dancing, ceremony and meditation are all forms of this process.**

*A guardian must consciously and subconsciously maintain these inter-dimensional energies so that they are dispersed in a proper manner.*

**Using Universal Law, a guardian imagines, then combines this with feeling to create.**

**Children do this instinctively when they play and sing and jump around although this is decidedly less focused.**

They obey the laws coming from above them, But on their own plane, and those below them they rule and give orders, and, yet, in so doing, they form a part of the Principle, instead of opposing it. The wise man falls in with the Law, and by understanding its movements he operates it instead of being its blind slave. Just as does the skilled swimmer turn this way and that way, going and coming as he will,  instead of being as the log which is carried here and there -- so is the wise man as compared to the ordinary man -- and yet both swimmer and log; wise man and fool, are subject to Law. He who understands this is well on the road to Mastery.""

 Creator has 51 cosmic days and each universe lasts a cosmic day of 4.3 billion years; each breath lasts 10 million years (expansion and contraction). Sometimes a universe plan is not working out and it will be withdrawn (wound down). Fortunately ours is apparently doing well and has over a billion years to go.  

   
There are, for example, countless Energy Transformers.

   

They are described as powerful and effective living switches. They are able to insulate planets against the powerful energy streams passing between gigantic starry neighbors. They maintain universal energy balance and power equilibrium, and they appear to fluctuate from storing energy to exuding and liberating it. They can regulate the energy potential of any realm to which they are assigned but deal only with physical and semi-material energies.
  

The Energy Transformers are referred to as the most remarkable and mysterious of all semi-material living creatures.  
  
   

The status of physical realms can be made to undergo a transformation under their skilful manipulations; they can change the form and potential of energies. Unfortunately examples are beyond our scientific understanding and even in most cases our mental concepts. 

  
Similar entities in this group of physical and semi-physical controllers are the following examples, though in these cases there can be no two-way communication.  
  
 

They can understand but cannot respond except by way of their function.  
  
Other entities, the Energy Transmitters, are skilful dispatchers of energy for the individual worlds. They can link in chains to direct energy appropriately and they are living superconductors. They can manifest energy in different forms making distant scenes 'visible' or distant sounds 'audible'. They are particularly valuable to planets having an impoverished atmosphere.  
  
 

The Primary Associators are masterly energy conservators and custodians. They work on a gigantic scale converting energies of space and also store energy during excesses. They manipulate universal codes like we utilize the alphabet to create different meanings. They are an order of life beyond human imagination.  
   

The Secondary Dissociators are alchemists of space and wonder-workers of time. They are concerned with the evolution of a form of energy unknown to us, and the administration of endless supplies of physical energies.  
  
 

Another entity in this class is the Frandalanks, whose numbers are beyond imagination. They are also referred to as intelligent machines. They function as living automatic pressure and velocity gauges registering the status of all forms of energy. These entities are subordinate to the supreme power centers; beings of greater intelligence and positions of control.  
  
On a somewhat more tangible level we might include in our brief list a group of beings, referred to in the Explorer books, who coordinate and synchronize time (some places in the galaxy utilize time, such as planet Earth).  
  
The information came from one of these beings, who we might consider in the category of assistants to the Creator, by the name Kazant (see 'Kazant - A Timekeeper'). There are only five of these personalities but they have cloned about 1400 to maintain their planet's technology.  

   

Their planet is about three times ours in size and a great distance from our galaxy - though no doubt in a different frequency spectrum since Kazant refers to eleven dimensions. Nevertheless they use bodies of humanoid appearance since they work with humans frequently but don't walk about, only float, and they do not eat or sleep, etc.  
  

They live in their planet at the centre of which is a crystal of 675 facets and is three miles in diameter. It enables them to study locations and civilizations.  
  
 

They regulate time in the third, fourth, fifth dimensions, and sixth to some degree (and sometimes the second dimension). They know everything about these places by looking through the right facet where they regulate time but do not interfere. They are fully occupied dealing with time throughout many galaxies.  
   

Kazant then gives an exercise to invest the reader with the fourth-dimensional time coefficient but only experientially - not the formula, which he says, some would like to use to slow down your time (it is speeding up and must for man to ascend).

0,afoods,44,3,"What is the point/goal of life? What are your views about God? How/why synchronicities happen?

&#x200B;

Now, the reason that I ask all these questions have a seed on some weird experiences I've got in 2018. In the previous year, when I started noticing synchronicities after some insights and after checking some overall occultic stuff, some objects of my worst fears popped into my objective reality regarding different themes... until I somehow connected the dots and reached christianity. Since then, I noticed how I lived a individualist life, running after my goals, never harming others, but also never stopping to help others. The fear and the synchs made me notice that I am a narcissist. You can consider me a healthy/shy narcissist who have a discreet way of calling attention to myself without having to humiliate others or mistreating them. My pride is something that moves me: I have also a schizoid personality disorder, which makes me feel pleasure in few things in life, one of them being a star (I have musical anhedonia, I don't feel pleasure in music in general, but I love to fantasize myself performing in the stage, feeling special, unique).

&#x200B;

With all that being said, 2018 was a turmoil of existential crisis and, when I finally decided to ignore the synchs and get off the fence, embracing a mix of panentheism + solipsism + hermeticism, something very strange happened to me.

&#x200B;

You see, in the middle of 2018, I was kinda agoraphobic reacting badly to some meds I was using. I could not get out from home without getting very stressed with my blood pressure skyrocketing to like 18/10. Then, the job opportunity of my dreams arrived and I was still in this state. In my confusion with beliefs before getting off the fence, I prayed hard to Jesus to help me to, somehow, succeed in the job interview and get this job. I went kinda panicky in the interviews, but everything managed to go right. The job is mine and I will start in the next week. Neat.

&#x200B;

But then, in december I was travelling in a beach house with my family, after I decided that I would not let the synchs bother me, embracing my new panentheist paradigm, I was recovering my life and becoming happy and peaceful again. A streak of synchronicities happened then:

&#x200B;

1-) I was at the living room table and I saw two tv ads: the first one was one ad of the company that I've been accepted. The following one was a government public ad with people smiling to the screen with a big ""THANK YOU"" in the front of the screen... the first person of the series was in front of a church. That triggered a thought in me: ""well, I might have changed beliefs, but maybe it's a good idea to do a christian prayer to thank Jesus for helping me in those tough times"".

&#x200B;

2-) After a shower, I decided then to get on my knees in my bedroom and pray. I thanked for all the help, and I also asked forgiveness if I was with my new beliefs wrong in some way, if I was not following the true path. After I finished my prayers, I power glimpse happened in the entire neighborhood. My beach house has this particular installation for a air conditioner that divides the house into two different power circuits. So, half of the house was still powered... but when that happened, only the light of my bedroom was on, this after my prayers. That triggered me also.

&#x200B;

3-) After solving the energy issues with my father... that stuff was still in my mind bugging me. I then opened myself to my father and told him what happened to me. I asked his advice about what would he do: abandon his desires and give up to christianity after all these strange events, or keep his normal life ignoring all this. He answered that I should keep doing the stuff that makes me happy, and that is what he would do. Few instants later, a soup opera in the TV presented this dialogue where a mother spoke the following to her son: ""don't follow the sinful steps of your father"". Well, that was the blow to make me go paranoid and depressed again. I started questioning if I was fighting fate.

&#x200B;

After that, I studied some subjects and I studied myself. So many paradigms: maybe my subconciouss fear + obsessions (I have OCD) gave energy to the stuff to manifest; maybe the matrix control system is a real thing and negative entities tried to lower my vibration; maybe a egregore is trying to gain a new follower; or maybe its a divine calling from the true God.

Now, I don't know what it all seems like to you under your framework. But I can't dismiss what happened as a mere coincidence: things were way too symbolical with surgical timings. There must be something more out there: laws that I could not comprehend, entities trying to harvest my emotions, intervention from God. I don't know what to think about all this anymore.

&#x200B;

The point is that I lived a so fucking boring youth and I just learned to love myself and have real fun in my 29 (I am 30 now). So I get depressed as fuck when I think that I am obligated to kill my ego, to stop feeling pride and etc. I have this dream of being a great lead singer, I love to self-express with my style and my speeches, I love my career and my skills, as I love my intelligence and my look... I am ready to have the best time of my life, but these synchs aligned to the dogmas of spirituality are putting me into a huge guilt trip that makes me wonder what is the right thing to do here: to keep ignoring these synchronicities and focus on things that makes me happy or to give up, be a slave of the synchs and decide to become a virtuous christian (and my OCD would make me a very virtuous and fanatic one).

&#x200B;

It seems sadistic to have a glimpse of euphoria for 4 months to then put me into a guilt trip to ""die for myself"". I am frustrated and full of supressed desires, and now I don't even know if I have the option to pursue then without suffering a metaphysical active punishment from God for not following the path he wants for me (and this is just a hypothesis). The stakes are too high for a all in. My plan was to indulge in my desires and dreams, but trying to practice more empathy and do good deeds while I keep my desires until I get tired of them, but now I don't even know if I have this option without suffering the consequences of some external wrath.

&#x200B;

The synchs that I stated are just a part of what happened to me in 2018, but I assure you that very unlikely and symbolical stuff in the same level occured to me before.

&#x200B;

Now, I am trying to forget what happened and following with my will. But I feel kinda off: maybe it's a effect of indoctrination, maybe its just my OCD new fear. I just want to have a 'normal' life without trying to be a monk or a martyr now that I finally can seize the life that I always wanted.

&#x200B;

What happened to me? What explains the synchs I got? Your interpretations and any advice on all this would be VERY welcomed. Sorry for the long text.

This one lady friend I knew was a minister during her life. She hardly spoke about the spiritual realm, ghosts, and that sort of thing. But, she did tell me that a young girl contacted her in a dream and showed her how she had died. This vision frightened her so much that she pleaded with God to have it stop. I think most evangelists stay clear from visions, ghost sighting, and so on because they are conditioned by society to do so. The general belief is that anyone who engages in spirituality such as astrology, tarot, is playing with fire. After being on this spiritual journey for some time now I have learned that there is nothing to fear. When you open up and accept knowledge for what it is, you'll reach deeper understandings. My stubborn nature is curious and when people tell me not to read about the occult or mysticism I take it as an invitation to go there and learn more.  

During the last weeks of my friend’s life, I visited her in the hospital. She had advanced stages of pancreatic cancer, knew that she had this, and never sought out treatment because she was taking care of her dying husband. After his passing, she went to see her doctor and it wasn’t long before her body gave out. As I walked into her hospital room I saw her husbands spirit standing in the corner.

 “You do know that he is here, don’t you?” I asked.

  “Yes, I do.” She replied.

 After she passed I saw the both of them standing by her coffin. They were watching their family and friends and listened to what everyone had to say. Then they went away. 

&#x200B;

Years later I was meditating when she came forward. Sometimes spirits come to us in the form of a “dark shadow” which we can see in our peripheral view. They communicate via our consciousness. I noticed her presence and shadow and immediately knew that I had a visitor. 

 I have heard many people speak about seeing shadows not knowing what this really is. When you give in to your fear of the unknown your experience can be horrible. Honestly, I have never experienced this even when encountering the most malicious spirits of all who are judged by many as ""demons"". 

She had the following to say (I will refer to her as spirit):

Spirit: You’ve been investigating the spiritual realm and I kept an eye on you because you intrigue me. I was aware of this realm but always kept myself back from exploring. Now that I am here I travel around. I am still attached to the physical realm (earth) because I have some karma left to resolve (In other words she is a ghost).

Me: How do you know about karma?

Spirit: When the body dies the veil is lifted and you are re-introduced to the universal laws (spiritual laws). You will go to a realm according to your resolved karma. My higher-self (soul) is connected and in touch with me. I am a spirit but I am also the soul. Most spirits are not aware of this connection.

Me: Can you resolve your karma in the spiritual realm?

Spirit: To a certain degree. Most karma will have to be resolved in a physical form.

&#x200B;

I thought that it was interesting that she decided to not move into the spiritual realm and detach from the physical. Apparently, you can choose to be a ghost and resolve some things. 

&#x200B;

   Most spirits go directly into the spiritual realm. Their silver cord is severed from the body by going through a tunnel into the light. The light is what severs this cord. After this, your spirit will rejuvenate and review its life. The spirit joins the higher-self which will be its resting place until it is time to return to a physical form. The spirits that remain unaware of their physical passing will become a ghost of their former self. They are “stuck” between the earth and the spiritual realm. You can see them when you tune into their frequency. 

If there’s still karma to resolve or lessons to be learned it will re-incarnate. All of the experiences are collected by the soul for its growth and evolution.

Spirit’s appear differently to me, like a shadow or transparent version of themselves, in a physical manifestation. Or I see them like they were in life when I connect with the astral realm (4th dimension). Remarkably their personality remains the same. Most of these spirits (ghosts) are not aware that they passed away. My friend knew that her body had died but decided to stay because she needed to resolve some things before moving into the spiritual realm. 

So, there you have it. We get to decide our experiences even after we pass away. ",new,Dark shadows are spirits,13

When a mother is pregnant and they offer their body as a vessel for new life, most likely, the mother will provide this growing child with the most loving, caring, nurturing and healthy environment that they possibly can. They now take their physical and mental health very seriously. After all, it has been proven that stress and poor health habits can affect the child's development.  


The woman who wrote the article went on to describe her experience of love for something so innocent, something that she has never seen with her eyes yet. During her pregnancy, she made the firm decision to provide her child with the most loving, positive and healthy environment to grow. ""self-care should be no less loving than the glowing, giggling, pure and unguarded LOVE you would give to a sweet and innocent baby.""  
\- Heaven Leigh  


That was my favorite quote!  


When there is an innocent child., counting on you to provide the proper environment  in order for it to grow into a healthy human being, you will most likely treat with your body, mind, and soul with care.   
Why not do this now, why not treat your body and mind with absolute unconditional love right now?   
There is an energy within you, a glowing, giggling, joyous, celebrating, passionate energy waiting to express. When you take care of your physical health, mental health and spiritual growth, you are providing this energy with the environment, with the vessel it needs to express.  


With unconditional love.

In soulnexus, I look for theories as storytelling like our ancestors around their cave fires. Categorizing some primary elemental themes as ""science fiction"" goes a long way in sharing ideas.

 I dont require everyone to believe my concepts if we all realize the age-old rule of improv comedy ""Yes, and..."" is so rewarding in intrinsic value to advancing worthy discussion. That said; the campfire story this morning is that of our Soul ""personalities"" and their different motivations for choosing Earth at this time to incarnate.

 I really appreciate Michael Newton's canonical themes describing a Soul's journeys from a ""Heaven"" realm, and each of these Souls choosing how to spend their 'timeless beings', learning about the many nooks and crannies of God's omniscience. The original Source Souls dont wear watches of course. They have no schedules. What they are dealing with on a much more significant scale is their higher understanding of highly various energy fields. They can see them...they can interact with the energy...BUT...sometimes apparently an energy volcano is encountered!

 Its not a literal mountain filled with liquid hot magma. Its a central node of highly concentrated energy or Source power with no good or bad intentions. These volcanoes theoretically are scattered about the entire volume of God's imagination. Well...Earth is chaotic and this indicates the influence of energy emanating from a volcano and instigating huge spectrums of possibilities. Earth is mostly breathtakingly beautiful. Aaaaaaand then again, some people make their little Earthly neighborhoods suck.

 I will give these provacateurs the benefit of the doubt. I will go ahead and say ""they couldnt help themselves as tyrannical and abusive. IT WAS THE LOCAL ENERGY VOLCANO FUELING THE MADNESS."" Then...imagine yourself as a Soul in heaven, deciding what to do with your eternal, invincible Super Self. You scope out Earth in a Heavenly telescope and see how intriguing and challenging it is to incarnate here. Your mission breaks down quite simply: Soul volunteers and goes to Earth, is born and grows to perform one task: absorb, process and recycle the volcano energies. 'The Forgetting' is specially designed so you dont chicken out from so much volcano surfing...it is hard fuckin work, right!?!?

**A number of compelling arguments have been put forth to support the Hollow Earth Theory.**

&#x200B;

This includes science, mythology, history and photographic evidence.


Mythology speaks of lost civilizations, the Middle Earth, Shamballa and the Land of Agharta, with entrances across the globe and at both poles.  The “Lost Horizon” Shangri-La was based on the stories of Shamballa.


https://i.redd.it/i89gm9ckwz921.png


Scientific observation of the structure of the universe from the extraordinarily large to the extraordinarily small reveals a truth regarding the structure of all of  Creation.  As the Earth is a product of that same Creation, it follows that it should contain that same structure.  Observe the apple, the neutron star and the atom.



*The most important force is not gravity but electromagnetism and the geometries of rotating plasma vortices*

There are hundreds of thousands of seismographic records available that represent soundings (via earthquakes) done from all over the earth.  There have always been seismographic findings which lacked an adequately simple and elegant explanation if we are to assume the Earth is solid, but fit perfectly with the hollow earth model.

**For example:**

peak earthquake ~intensity is found at the surface and at 800 miles down. It decreases and increases in intensity between these two points in a “U-shaped” configuration.  No quakes are found below 800 miles. Earthquakes are statistically more intense near a surface.  This is therefore consistent with two surfaces.



Also, the “shadow zone” findings don’t have a good answer in the solid earth model, but fit perfectly with the hollow earth model.  The “shadow zone” is an area on the surface located between 103º and 144º to an epicenter.  There shouldn’t be any seismic waves detected at these positions, but there are.


*Pictures take from space almost always show cloud cover obscuring the polar positions.*


https://i.redd.it/x1lcs8bnwz921.png


If these entrances are actually there, they would likely be exchanging air of different temperatures resulting in a condensation of water vapor and the development of cloud cover.



**However, sometimes the cloud cover is not obscuring the entrances.**



https://i.redd.it/w5duuh2myz921.png


People working inside NASA have stated that they had been instructed to airbrush out those entrances on photographs.


https://i.redd.it/bzc538pqwz921.png


*However, photographs are available that show anomalous findings in the polar regions consistent with such an entrance.*



** After the U.S. military attack on the entrances in 2000, they were closed by the Aghartans with force fields and holograms.**

The Admiral Byrd Diary was posted on the internet a number of years ago which describes his flight into the North Pole in 1947 and his encounter with an inner earth civilization.


He also explored the South Pole entrance in 1956 for a distance of several thousand miles. Witnesses to the document’s authenticity are still alive.


[Artist Rendering](https://i.redd.it/p1bs4owoyz921.png)


His family knows of his subsequent trip to Washington D.C. to communicate their message to President Harry Truman

The U.S. had just detonated two nuclear weapons on Japan the year before and they warned us that we will destroy ourselves if we do not dismantle those weapons.


**The movie, “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” was created to communicate that encounter.**


Others such as Dr. Fritzjof Nansen, Admiral George Dufek, Colonel Billie Faye Woodard, Olaf Jansen and Sheldon Nidle have also reported and described first-hand experiences in the inner Earth.


**Our United States military is treating all this information with fear; that to release this information will cause discord and collapse of social structure.**


They’re afraid that other countries will get this information.  We’re not sure which countries they could be referring to, as it appears that nearly every nation on Earth has this information. The process of fear is being generated by the private contractors and the “secret government” who work there; who seek to control us and advance their own  personal agendas.


**The Model of Inner Earth**


The crust of the Earth involutes. The inside surface and the outside surface are similar, with oceans and rivers and lakes and forests.


The Earth’s crust is about 800 miles thick. There is a zero gravity point 400 miles down. There is a central sun located about 2900 miles from the inner surface which is composed of two counter-rotating fields of pulsating electromagnetic fields that radiate a bluish-white light with heat.


It is about 600 miles in diameter and it appears substantially bigger than our sun from the point of view of an observer on the surface.  It also never sets.


**The central sun is held in position by electro-gravitic repulsion.**


The plasma field that is generated is often seen as a colorful stream of light emanating from the poles called the aurora borealis. There is one ocean and a continent with lush vegetation which grows much larger than that found here.


The total land area is greater than the outside.


*There is one culture and seven races of beings that live there in perfect harmony with themselves and nature. There are no wars or disease.  Humans are taller and live much longer than us.  We were originally created to live 1000 years but our lives were cut short when we moved to the surface.  This may be the original Garden of Eden.

**The opening to the north entrance is found at coordinates 84.4º N 141º E, which places it 560 miles north-west of the New Siberian Islands.**  ((The North Magnetic Pole is shifting where again ??))

*There is a depression in the Earth’s crust leading up to the opening which is approximately 890 miles in diameter.*


There is a mammoth Great Ice Barrier surrounding the opening and inside the curve of the polar opening is another ring of ice called the Great Massive Fresh Water Ice Pack.  The actual entrance is 90 miles wide at its narrowest point.

**The Inner Earth Culture**


• Language – Solara Maru or the solar language. Similar to Sanskrit or ancient Hebrew.


• Government – Council of Twelve, six men and six women solve problems and act as guides. Appointments of variable periods are considered an honor. The High Priest, an Ascended Master, called the Brahytma is “The King of the World”, and two sages Mahynga and Mahytma create a triple spiritual authority.



• Computers – Quantum amino-acid based, link all homes and cities with a highly spiritualized information network.


• Libraries and Universities – more vast than anything ever seen on the surface covering knowledge accumulated over 55,000 years.


• Money – Non-existent. All basic needs are provided. Sophisticated barter system for non-basic needs.


• Population – One billion.


• Transportation – Electromagnetic sleds and subway system. Mag-Lev monorail exceeds 3000 mph. Moving sidewalks and elevators intercity. Space travel to other star systems, inter-dimensional and time travel using anti-grav vehicles.


• Entertainment – Theatre, concerts and the arts. Holodecks for interactive adventure. Program your favorite movie and become a part of it. Pursuing one’s joy is not only allowed, it’s required.


• Health – Disease does not exit. Healing is accelerated.


• Childbirth – Three months, not nine. Painless, water birthing, beautiful music, thought and imagery.

• Height – Any, but mostly tall from 6’ to 12’. Physical size can be modified.

• Age – Unlimited. Death does not exist. Maintain the appearance of middle age while being many thousands of years old. Disincarnate at will into the spiritual realm.

• The Anunnaki at the start of the Kali Yuga sealed off this Kingdom from the surface around 3200 B.C., with Babylon, Nimrod, and the ‘reign of terror’.

• Their culture is far more advanced than anything on the surface of Earth. It was the decision of the inner-earth people to block our use of weapons of mass destruction. We will unite with them soon.

**The View From Above**

Earth is known as the accursed planet. Our evolution has been through pain, sorrow, suffering and the illusion of physical death. It has not always been thus

*Once mankind inhabited a beautiful and radiant planet. On that world they knew none of these things,but in time they grew proud and arrogant. They made war among themselves and ultimately destroyed it. What exists today of that planet is a barren ring of asteroids and debris.*

In order that those entities might gain understanding, compassion and brotherly love they were reborn into the animalistic, material world of a lesser planet called Earth. Suffering, sorrow, frustration and death became their teachers.

 Their symbol became the Man-Beast.


In the illusion of Time and through repeated births and deaths, each entity is slowly and painfully evolving spiritually toward his former state. 

All human races on Earth came from elsewhere and the evidence of their arrival and the remains of their ships may be found beneath the deserts and oceans. There are five major and at least thirteen minor races found here on Earth in various stages of evolution.

 Our five major human ancestors are the Lyrans, Sirians, Pleiadians, Centaurians and Andromedans (some names have evolved just as Acturian and other sub sections that would take a long time.  This is not an end all list.)

Our surface civilization is like a cancer to the Earth. She must shed her negative energy to ascend in vibrational frequency. As she transforms, the irritating non-harmonic artificial structures must be destroyed. We, therefore, must also generate positive energy to transform  with her. Not even the ETs can stop the Earth from doing this, but they can help us adapt and get through it intact.

The Founders of the Game moved some of the humanoids to Sirius B so they could be away from the reptilian interference. Over a very long period of time two groups emerged called the “Etherics” (nonphysicals) and the “Physicals.”

The Etherics were feminine polarized and the Physicals were male polarized. The Founders then moved the Physicals to Aln, the Reptilians home world and the Etherics were moved to Tiamat, the primordial Earth

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lgss47jpuz921.png

&#x200B;

The Reptilians weren’t real happy about the Physical Humanoids showing up on their planet and soon the battles began and the colony was nearly destroyed. Some of the humans were forced into slavery and others went underground and formed the Black League. The Black League managed to escape Aln for Tiamat to join the Etherics.

The Reptilians eventually found out about Tiamat and decided to colonize it. When they arrived, there was a proto-humanoid civilization and the Etherics. The Etherics sent positive energy to the Reptiles in an effort to create a peaceful coexistence and get them to let go of their Creation Myth. It worked well for a very long while. It almost looked like integration had already occurred. There were snake reptiles on one side, dinoid reptiles on the other and the humanoids in the middle. The humanoids had learned farming and were growing enough food to feed the whole planet. This was subsequently called the Great Experiment, the forerunner of planet Earth. This was the first time Etherics had been used to obtain a peaceful coexistence and it was amazingly successful.

However, word got out that a planet existed that was living in peace and harmony and the ruling Orion Reptilians decided to pay a visit. This was, of course, in violation of the Creation Myth and they immediately started sowing the seeds of discord among the Reptiles in an attempt to convince them that the Humanoids were secretly planning their destruction. It took a very long time for the ruling Reptilians to work this plan through because the Etherics kept sending thoughts of love and harmony and the physical humanoids kept sending them food. But ultimately the Creation Myth won out and the Reptiles developed a plan to destroy the humanoids through germ warfare.

The proto-humanoids understood what was happening and decided that they would leave the planet and go to the Pleiades aboard the starship Pegasus and the Etherics would mutate back into the aquatic primates (whales and dolphins) and maintain the biosphere. A plan was devised to rid the planet of the Reptiles through implosions of the underground fusion generators.

About 98% of the Reptiles were destroyed in the ensuing world-wide cataclysm but a few survived and were present when the remaining planet was repopulated as Earth. Another small group was given sanctuary aboard the Pegasus and went to the Pleiades. Another group fled to the planet Maldek. This all happened about 8 million years ago

Satan or the devil. If their plan is allowed to be completed, the planet could be destroyed. They don’t care, they only want revenge.

A war of liberation broke out on Lyra about 360,000 years ago during which the terrorizing army fled to the Pleiades and took possession of the Hesperides system. The name was changed to the Pleja system in honor of their leader. She led an expedition to the SOL system and took control of Mars, Earth and Malona. Conflict broke out on Malona over control of the planetary government. Earth was evacuated back to Lyra-Vega. The war on Malona ultimately pulverized the planet and caused significant destructions on Mars, Venus and Earth.

A peaceful group of Lyran-Vegans migrated back to Earth many years later and developed a high civilization of Hybornea which lasted 6000 years and was again destroyed by wars. About 53,000 years ago wars again broke out in the Lyran system and a leader named Pelegon came to Earth with 70,000 men to establish another civilization which lasted 10,000 years and ultimately was again destroyed by wars. About 100,000 people fled to the Barnard Star (Beta Centaurus) while Earth was thrown back to the Stone Age.

They returned after 7000 years under the leadership of Atlant to create the great Atlantian civilization. His wife Karyatide created Lesser Atlantis and her father Muras created the great civilization of Mu. These blossomed into a planetary civilization which lasted 18,000 years until, in 13,000 B.C., a group of scientists tried seizing power. They were trying to again create a race to support their violent tendencies. Before the scientists were subdued and escaped back to Beta Centaurus, much of the continent of Atlantis was destroyed.

Two thousand years later this same group returned for revenge under the leadership of Arus (the Barbarian) and his 200 sub-leaders. He conquered Hybornea and began to systematically subjugate the rest of the world by attacking India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and surrounding areas. It was Arus and his men who were the “Sons of Heaven” that bred with the Earth females called the “Evas” to create the biblical Adam and Eve, the ancestors of many present-day humans. The descendants of Arus left the planet in 26 A.D. after creating Jmmanuel and implanting the Galactic laws and philosophies in humanity.

The origins of Lemuria began on a continent in what is now the Pacific Ocean around 900,000 B.C. and lasted until 26,000 B.C. It was a Lyrian/Sirian styled civilization with democratic principles of governance. It created a number of daughter empires during its existence; the most important of those was Atlantis (which existed in part, on a huge island-continent in the center of the Atlantic Ocean), the Libyan/Egyptian Empire in Africa and the Yü Empire of central China and Tibet.

Due to the influence of renegade Pleiadians / Centurians (Anunnaki), the Atlanteans began developing a hierarchical society which led to feelings of separateness and superiority.   After they were granted equal guardianship of the planet 26,000 years ago by the Lemurians, they began plotting ways to grab the sole guardianship. They found allies in the colonies of Alpha Centauri and the Pleiades mostly through the Galactic Federation outpost colonies that shared the concept of a hierarchical society. They and various Pleiadian and Centaurian rebel-renegades plotted the destruction of Lemuria. Their plan was a technical success; however it resulted in the destruction of one of the Earth’s moons, the entire continent of Lemuria, cataclysmic events over the entire earth and a mini-ice-age.

&#x200B;

The Atlantians (with the assistance of the Pleiadian and Centurian Rebels) used space ships with force fields to cause one of the Earths moon’s to spiral inward and just as the moon reached the ‘LaGrange Point’, they blasted it with particle beam weaponry.

This resulted in a massive meteor shower over Lemuria with the resulting rupture of its subterranean gas chambers and the sinking of the entire continent. The physical destruction of Lemuria was so complete that nothing remained except legends\*\***. This was Great Flood #1.\*\***

&#x200B;

**Atlantis had its beginnings about 100,000 years ago. It was destroyed three times; the last time was coincident with Great Flood #3.**   In the second incarnation, which began 25,000 years ago, they had made great technological progress which was far greater that anything man has attained today however, it lacked sufficient spiritual development and became locked into materialistic endeavors.  They wished to replace the clan structure of Lemurian society with an elite structure. This concept of governance was not well received and resulted in a series of costly civil wars across the entire planet. The clan structure is based on groups of people who all shared the same vision and goals about what should be accomplished in their respective fields. It was similar to our present-day scientist and technical trade-groups, except that these trade-groups also had limited governing authority. It meant that the most knowledgeable people were the ones in charge. It has been the elite form of governance that has been in place on this planet ever since Atlantis came to power 25,000 years ago.

They brought in one of the artificial Maldek moons to help balance the planet. The destruction of one of Earth’s two moons caused an unstable wobble in the Earth. This artificial moon was, in fact, a fully armed battle station. It was also an attempt to signal to the rebellious holdouts that military superiority was at hand which was ready and able to end all civil wars and rebellions. The rebellions instead continued over the entire 10,000 year period of this Middle Empire. There was a period of terrorism torture and inquisitions. They created a superior ruling class which was sustained by the myth of a godking. A single supreme god-king ruled over all.

Following the destruction of Lemuria, the Libyan/Egyptian Empire negotiated an understanding that allowed them to maintain some autonomy over their own affairs; however they did have to make some concessions to do this. The only other Empire of significance was the Yü, which refused to bow down to the Atlanteans. They even issued several decrees demanding an apology to the other empires for their careless and inhumane destruction of Lemuria and the subsequent cataclysms.

**The Atlanteans, jointly with the Egyptians, countered with demands to rescind the decrees. The Yü Empire refused. The combined forces of the Atlantians, the Egyptians and the renegade Pleiadian Centurian allies forced the remnants of the Yü Empire underground.**

&#x200B;

They still exist today as the Kingdom of Agharta in deep underground caverns beneath the Himalayan Mountains and under present day Tibet. The entrances from Tibet were all closed after China invaded in 1949. It is not clear, but is believed that they were searching for the entrances. Attempts to find it using modern day tunneling equipment have been unsuccessful.

Towards the end of the second Empire, autocratic rule was in full force and the remaining rebel alliance was exiled to southern Europe, to a place called Ionia (Greece) and there they would stay until they renounced their ways and complied with the ruling authority. This rebel alliance consisted of the former ruling elite as well as leading scientists. They decided instead to create a Lemurian style governance with plans to ultimately bring their government back to Atlantis. In other words, they became even more organized and dangerous than before they were exiled.

This did not sit well with the ruling authority of Atlantis. The rebels had defied them at every turn and now they were a greater threat than before. A plan was devised to end the problem by destroying Ionia by a method similar to the way they destroyed Lemuria. The plan required the assistance of the rebel Pleiadians and Centurians. This plot was discovered by the Ionians. The result was that the Ionians were able to counter the attack by interrupting their energy beam from Nibiru and the moon exploded over Atlantis instead. Atlantis therefore was destroyed in much the same manner as it had destroyed Lemuria. The Atlantean subcontinent was reduced to a few scattered islands. One of the two Firmament layers was destroyed as well. **This was Great Flood #2. This happened 13,000 years ago.**

This event did not completely destroy Atlantis however and attempts were made to reconstitute the civilization with what remained. They developed a crystal technology that was capable of transmitting energy wirelessly over great distances. They used the device to propel and guide airplanes, surface vehicles and submarines. They tapped solar energy and also found a way to tap the collective consciousness of the human mind. They eventually found a way to use the collective mind in harmony with the crystals and the Earth as a power source. The people became subservient to this system of mind and power control against their will (ala “The Matrix”). They also found a way to harness the power of the crystal to rejuvenate a person endlessly. One of the crystals is in the Biblical Ark.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/52f7qiv5vz921.png

Several thousand years before the first flood, the Anunnaki showed up in a ceremonious fashion and presented themselves as gods from heaven to the Atlantians. They started plugging into the egoconsciousness of the leaders by stimulating and fueling their base desires. New technologies were offered as gifts and in return they would do their bidding in holding influence over their subjects in rather depraved ways. They were instrumental in creating mind-Earth resonance devices and even came up with a way to alter the mind of the people to obey their wishes through a slow-pitched electro-magnetic pulse transmitted through the crystal generator network. This sound, which was inaudible to the human ear, caused a release of neurochemicals (the peptides that influence behavior) that caused irrational emotional states and submission to authority. They began attacking lesser civilizations to conquer and take their resources. Through genetic engineering they also helped develop a mutant human who was disconnected from his higher self. These humans would be unaware of their spirituality and would be much easier to control. These evolved into present-day humans.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lb7w8eh9vz921.png

The final destruction of Atlantis occurred sometime around 10,000 years ago. There was a conflict in the Middle East between the Rama Empire, the Egyptian Empire and the Sumerian Empire. In an attempt to end the conflict they destroyed some of the crystal temples that held up the Firmament. The idea was to open a hole just big enough to flood the enemy out of their positions. However, there was a simultaneous destruction of multiple temples on both sides which destroyed a sufficient number to cause the entire Firmament to collapse. This caused all of the water ice suspended in the atmosphere to come crashing down in a cascade effect over the entire planet. What remained of Atlantis was gone forever beneath the waves. **A significant portion of Atlantis still exists at the bottom of the ocean in the Central Atlantic, off the coast of the Carolinas, the Bahamas and the south-western coast of Cuba. This was Great Flood #3.**

**This is when THOTH manifested the Emerald Tablets.**

**Now we are here.**

Thank you and may the light keep you.


Update :______


So the restoration of life on this planet was once again in the hands of the same people who caused the problem in the first place. It was their intervention that triggered the destruction of Lemuria, the destruction of Atlantis and the entire world civilization. Through it all, it still didn’t sink into the Pleiadian rebels what they were doing to mankind. In the period 1500 B.C. through 1200 B.C. the renegade Pleiadians were forced to withdraw from direct intervention by the main defense forces of the Pleiadian Star League. This finally brought the “reign of terror” to an end. 


The Spiritual Hierarchy was responsible for sending the Christ, Budda, Mohammed, Ahkenaton and other ascended masters to show us “the way the truth and the light”.  

*This planted the seeds of spiritual consciousness.*

 Other attempts to bring back the Sirian/Lemurian style governance included Noah and   the Hebrews. Noah didn’t get very far and after the Exodus; the Hebrews instituted the concept of 
Judges to bring the people a concept of a society led by spiritual beings. 

However, these attempts  failed because the human psyche was not ready for it and it was decided that planting the idea of a Christ consciousness would grow into the human psyche over thousands of years and be ultimately  successful. 

**Emperor Constantine modified these teachings in 325 A.D. at the Council of Nicea.**

,,,beecause of the destruction of the Firmament, a significant amount of damaging radiation has been allowed to hit the planet surface. This causes a disastrous effect on all living things. There was no reasonable chance that humans would be able to survive over the long term independent of outside support with their spiritual selves disconnected. 

**Most humans don’t know that their primary mission on the planet is to be a guardian of the planet; that without their conscious support of the biosphere in concert with the cetaceans, all life on the planet falls apart, literally.**

The only thing that’s still holding it together right now is the cetaceans and the Spiritual Hierarchy. A guardian is one who brings in the energies of creation and regulates them for the 
biosphere. The Earth land guardian is man. It is a very unique process whereby the creative life energies given by the Spiritual Hierarchy are physically transmuted into maintenance life energies. 

**Chanting, singing, dancing, ceremony and meditation are all forms of this process.**

 A guardian must consciously and subconsciously maintain these inter-dimensional energies so that they are dispersed in a proper manner. Using Universal Law, a guardian imagines, then combines this with feeling to create. 

**Children do this instinctively when they play and sing and jump around although this is decidedly less focused.**


 Forces of Dark????

 The Forces of Dark upon this planet are interfering with the natural ascension and causing 
disharmony. **One of the tools being used is the television.** This keeps us in a receptive hypnotic trance state.

   Other tools include politics, war, religion, sex, material pleasures, games and amusements. The 
core of this hierarchy (the Illuminati) are programmed at birth through magical methods to believe they have reincarnated through a long line of beings committed to a destructive plan to remove mankind from spirituality. Earth and its inhabitants are firmly within the grip of this influence. 

  There plan has been to hold us at our lowest energy level so that we cannot take advantage of the dimensional leap at the shift of the cycles. They plan instead, to take us to an even lower vibrational level and strip away our remaining soul energy and combine that with the cosmic shift (zero point) energy to cause this entire sector of space to shift from positive to negative. Interestingly, this is Earth was created as a place for all souls of the Universe to experience at least once in their evolution, so that they may learn to integrate the physical with the spiritual. 

However, instead of moving on, most souls have become stuck in a loop that has bottlenecked the evolution of the entire Universe. 

**They have succumbed to the materialism, the pleasures and the pain and have been treating them as the  source of all priorities. Earth has become contaminated and is heading towards its own destruction.**

The perpetrators however, have an even more diabolical agenda. They wish to create a negative 
polarity Universe.  There is more potential for total mass destruction than at any time in the history of this Universe.  This cannot be allowed as this contamination would then spread throughout all of Creation. All that is good and all that is love would be destroyed.

On my way of enlightenment, in the summer/autumn afternoons, where I climbed to the very top of our big walnut tree and looked into the sunset, framed into oceans of multicolored mountain clouds (you know, very intense impressions) many memories came up. They were more of a feeling than a knowledge, I once felt like a captain on a big ship, sailing through the unknown, totally letting go of everything behind me. I felt like so many intense, beautiful and nostalgic-seeming personalities, that I began to think about their origin...

&#x200B;

Maybe these were past lifes, maybe the moment I was experiencing, looked at with the required open mind, told me things, about my past, about my properties, about my richness and the richness of the moment. It was so beautiful, looking at the stars, into the endless universe, at the mysterios shining and everyone guiding moon... sometimes I just cried because of this beauty...

&#x200B;

Now to the rational part, where do these feelings come from ? One can only feel something (interprete it out of an outward sensation) if he has something to start with. A man living in a blacked-out cave for his whole life could never imagine, what a ""tiny village surrounded by green meadows and small lakes"" looks (feels) like. 

So where does this come from ? 

&#x200B;

It may be a childhood experience, I was a very intense novel-reader, I dove into them and maybe manifested them as real as someone would experience the outer world. Or even realer, because this world had my entire focus, my entire creativity. The question then is, what was the sense of all these worlds I created ? Were they needed for me to understand the present moment ? My past lifes ? The incredible possibilities of ourselfs and this universe ? 

&#x200B;

The other thing could be, that these sensations were sparklets of my past lifes, a slight feeling from the otherside of the rim of our perception. That would be another goal (in experience), needing my pre-imaginated knowledge.

My whole life I've been super interested in Egyptian, Greek, Vedic, Mesoamerican civilizations but also many others. I used to think they were all separate developments but there is now enough evidence, to my estimation, that they were all the successors of some greater previous civilization that has been lost to time or hidden intentionally or just plain ignored by hubris, sometimes a combination of all three. I started to feel that Atlantis may have been real and the evidence is right in front of us, there has been a lot of wild speculation around this topic but that doesn't mean all of it should be dismissed outright. This idea has gained a lot of steam this decade and I feel like it's not taboo anymore to believe in alternative history more than academic narrative. 

I didn't look much more into this subject until recently. About 2 years ago, I started to realize that I had ESP and I wasn't the only one. I've always had this ability and couldn't explain certain things to anyone, why they happened. I felt crazy when I thought about the current paradigm that we live in and so I kept this to myself. But I've met people through this medium, even some strange animal encounters while at National Parks. I've received communications too, not even sure from exactly where but they were helpful and benevolent so I've never felt a reason to be afraid. I've learned that this stuff has happened to many other people too and some of it has been published before I was even before. I had no idea. This power has been described in many places throughout history, it's nothing new or special. I've even started to notice how to harness and direct it, I didn't know that before. It's pretty cool to be honest but spooky sometimes for sure.

So being this 'out there', I didn't quite fit in with the overly political/religious country I was born in or the spiritually materialistic culture I was born into. I ventured out and first tried to fit in with the hippies I met at music festival, didn't end up being as helpful as I thought it would. I tried again in the tech industry, nope. I finally settled for just flying solo as a digital nomad for awhile and being perfectly okay with that. Reddit became helpful in this time. I've been looking for a sub where I can keep piecing together the Great Mystery and to continue the path of Self-Realization, it's a pretty simple and sincere desire. I tried to find that in several different subs, no luck so far. Too many -isms still, so much invested in maintaining the old paradigm.

The proto-humanoids understood what was happening and decided that they would leave the planet and go to the Pleiades aboard the starship Pegasus and the Etherics would mutate back into the aquatic primates (whales and dolphins) and maintain the biosphere. A plan was devised to rid the planet of the Reptiles through implosions of the underground fusion generators.

About 98% of the Reptiles were destroyed in the ensuing world-wide cataclysm but a few survived and were present when the remaining planet was repopulated as Earth. Another small group was given sanctuary aboard the Pegasus and went to the Pleiades. Another group fled to the planet Maldek. This all happened about 8 million years ago

Satan or the devil. If their plan is allowed to be completed, the planet could be destroyed. They don’t care, they only want revenge.

A war of liberation broke out on Lyra about 360,000 years ago during which the terrorizing army fled to the Pleiades and took possession of the Hesperides system. The name was changed to the Pleja system in honor of their leader. She led an expedition to the SOL system and took control of Mars, Earth and Malona. Conflict broke out on Malona over control of the planetary government. Earth was evacuated back to Lyra-Vega. The war on Malona ultimately pulverized the planet and caused significant destructions on Mars, Venus and Earth.

A peaceful group of Lyran-Vegans migrated back to Earth many years later and developed a high civilization of Hybornea which lasted 6000 years and was again destroyed by wars. About 53,000 years ago wars again broke out in the Lyran system and a leader named Pelegon came to Earth with 70,000 men to establish another civilization which lasted 10,000 years and ultimately was again destroyed by wars. About 100,000 people fled to the Barnard Star (Beta Centaurus) while Earth was thrown back to the Stone Age.

They returned after 7000 years under the leadership of Atlant to create the great Atlantian civilization. His wife Karyatide created Lesser Atlantis and her father Muras created the great civilization of Mu. These blossomed into a planetary civilization which lasted 18,000 years until, in 13,000 B.C., a group of scientists tried seizing power. They were trying to again create a race to support their violent tendencies. Before the scientists were subdued and escaped back to Beta Centaurus, much of the continent of Atlantis was destroyed.

Two thousand years later this same group returned for revenge under the leadership of Arus (the Barbarian) and his 200 sub-leaders. He conquered Hybornea and began to systematically subjugate the rest of the world by attacking India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq and surrounding areas. It was Arus and his men who were the “Sons of Heaven” that bred with the Earth females called the “Evas” to create the biblical Adam and Eve, the ancestors of many present-day humans. The descendants of Arus left the planet in 26 A.D. after creating Jmmanuel and implanting the Galactic laws and philosophies in humanity.

The origins of Lemuria began on a continent in what is now the Pacific Ocean around 900,000 B.C. and lasted until 26,000 B.C. It was a Lyrian/Sirian styled civilization with democratic principles of governance. It created a number of daughter empires during its existence; the most important of those was Atlantis (which existed in part, on a huge island-continent in the center of the Atlantic Ocean), the Libyan/Egyptian Empire in Africa and the Yü Empire of central China and Tibet.

Due to the influence of renegade Pleiadians / Centurians (Anunnaki), the Atlanteans began developing a hierarchical society which led to feelings of separateness and superiority.   After they were granted equal guardianship of the planet 26,000 years ago by the Lemurians, they began plotting ways to grab the sole guardianship. They found allies in the colonies of Alpha Centauri and the Pleiades mostly through the Galactic Federation outpost colonies that shared the concept of a hierarchical society. They and various Pleiadian and Centaurian rebel-renegades plotted the destruction of Lemuria. Their plan was a technical success; however it resulted in the destruction of one of the Earth’s moons, the entire continent of Lemuria, cataclysmic events over the entire earth and a mini-ice-age.

&#x200B;

The Atlantians (with the assistance of the Pleiadian and Centurian Rebels) used space ships with force fields to cause one of the Earths moon’s to spiral inward and just as the moon reached the ‘LaGrange Point’, they blasted it with particle beam weaponry.

This resulted in a massive meteor shower over Lemuria with the resulting rupture of its subterranean gas chambers and the sinking of the entire continent. The physical destruction of Lemuria was so complete that nothing remained except legends\*\***. This was Great Flood #1.\*\***

&#x200B;

**Atlantis had its beginnings about 100,000 years ago. It was destroyed three times; the last time was coincident with Great Flood #3.**   In the second incarnation, which began 25,000 years ago, they had made great technological progress which was far greater that anything man has attained today however, it lacked sufficient spiritual development and became locked into materialistic endeavors.  They wished to replace the clan structure of Lemurian society with an elite structure. This concept of governance was not well received and resulted in a series of costly civil wars across the entire planet. The clan structure is based on groups of people who all shared the same vision and goals about what should be accomplished in their respective fields. It was similar to our present-day scientist and technical trade-groups, except that these trade-groups also had limited governing authority. It meant that the most knowledgeable people were the ones in charge. It has been the elite form of governance that has been in place on this planet ever since Atlantis came to power 25,000 years ago.

They brought in one of the artificial Maldek moons to help balance the planet. The destruction of one of Earth’s two moons caused an unstable wobble in the Earth. This artificial moon was, in fact, a fully armed battle station. It was also an attempt to signal to the rebellious holdouts that military superiority was at hand which was ready and able to end all civil wars and rebellions. The rebellions instead continued over the entire 10,000 year period of this Middle Empire. There was a period of terrorism torture and inquisitions. They created a superior ruling class which was sustained by the myth of a godking. A single supreme god-king ruled over all.

Following the destruction of Lemuria, the Libyan/Egyptian Empire negotiated an understanding that allowed them to maintain some autonomy over their own affairs; however they did have to make some concessions to do this. The only other Empire of significance was the Yü, which refused to bow down to the Atlanteans. They even issued several decrees demanding an apology to the other empires for their careless and inhumane destruction of Lemuria and the subsequent cataclysms.

**The Atlanteans, jointly with the Egyptians, countered with demands to rescind the decrees. The Yü Empire refused. The combined forces of the Atlantians, the Egyptians and the renegade Pleiadian Centurian allies forced the remnants of the Yü Empire underground.**

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/bwxaglhysv921.png

They still exist today as the Kingdom of Agharta in deep underground caverns beneath the Himalayan Mountains and under present day Tibet. The entrances from Tibet were all closed after China invaded in 1949. It is not clear, but is believed that they were searching for the entrances. Attempts to find it using modern day tunneling equipment have been unsuccessful.

Towards the end of the second Empire, autocratic rule was in full force and the remaining rebel alliance was exiled to southern Europe, to a place called Ionia (Greece) and there they would stay until they renounced their ways and complied with the ruling authority. This rebel alliance consisted of the former ruling elite as well as leading scientists. They decided instead to create a Lemurian style governance with plans to ultimately bring their government back to Atlantis. In other words, they became even more organized and dangerous than before they were exiled.

This did not sit well with the ruling authority of Atlantis. The rebels had defied them at every turn and now they were a greater threat than before. A plan was devised to end the problem by destroying Ionia by a method similar to the way they destroyed Lemuria. The plan required the assistance of the rebel Pleiadians and Centurians. This plot was discovered by the Ionians. The result was that the Ionians were able to counter the attack by interrupting their energy beam from Nibiru and the moon exploded over Atlantis instead. Atlantis therefore was destroyed in much the same manner as it had destroyed Lemuria. The Atlantean subcontinent was reduced to a few scattered islands. One of the two Firmament layers was destroyed as well. **This was Great Flood #2. This happened 13,000 years ago.**

This event did not completely destroy Atlantis however and attempts were made to reconstitute the civilization with what remained. They developed a crystal technology that was capable of transmitting energy wirelessly over great distances. They used the device to propel and guide airplanes, surface vehicles and submarines. They tapped solar energy and also found a way to tap the collective consciousness of the human mind. They eventually found a way to use the collective mind in harmony with the crystals and the Earth as a power source. The people became subservient to this system of mind and power control against their will (ala “The Matrix”). They also found a way to harness the power of the crystal to rejuvenate a person endlessly. One of the crystals is in the Biblical Ark.

Several thousand years before the first flood, the Anunnaki showed up in a ceremonious fashion and presented themselves as gods from heaven to the Atlantians. They started plugging into the egoconsciousness of the leaders by stimulating and fueling their base desires. New technologies were offered as gifts and in return they would do their bidding in holding influence over their subjects in rather depraved ways. They were instrumental in creating mind-Earth resonance devices and even came up with a way to alter the mind of the people to obey their wishes through a slow-pitched electro-magnetic pulse transmitted through the crystal generator network. This sound, which was inaudible to the human ear, caused a release of neurochemicals (the peptides that influence behavior) that caused irrational emotional states and submission to authority. They began attacking lesser civilizations to conquer and take their resources. Through genetic engineering they also helped develop a mutant human who was disconnected from his higher self. These humans would be unaware of their spirituality and would be much easier to control. These evolved into present-day humans.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/49k54ke3tv921.png

The final destruction of Atlantis occurred sometime around 10,000 years ago. There was a conflict in the Middle East between the Rama Empire, the Egyptian Empire and the Sumerian Empire. In an attempt to end the conflict they destroyed some of the crystal temples that held up the Firmament. The idea was to open a hole just big enough to flood the enemy out of their positions. However, there was a simultaneous destruction of multiple temples on both sides which destroyed a sufficient number to cause the entire Firmament to collapse. This caused all of the water ice suspended in the atmosphere to come crashing down in a cascade effect over the entire planet. What remained of Atlantis was gone forever beneath the waves. **A significant portion of Atlantis still exists at the bottom of the ocean in the Central Atlantic, off the coast of the Carolinas, the Bahamas and the south-western coast of Cuba. This was Great Flood #3.**

**This is when THOTH manifested the Emerald Tablets.**

**Now we are here.**

0,aezxfu,6,7," Here is a quick thought that I hope will help someone out there who has dealt with this lately.

Relax, chill out and stop being so hard on yourself. It is great that you have such high standards to become the greatest version of yourself. It's fantastic that you are willing to make sacrifices to become a better you. You are trying, you are putting forth effort most people, unfortunately, do not. This is all so beautiful and you should be giving yourselves a pat on the back for your efforts. But you care too much, you expect too much, and this is eating you alive. Just take a step back, and stop taking yourself too seriously. You are guided, you are taken care of, and every moment will pass regardless of your worry and anxiety-driven thoughts about it. So be here right now, present with this moment. Because this all your life is, and all it will ever be. This moment is the most important moment of your life. Once you realize this, that voice that disguises itself as you, kicking and screaming that you are worthless, lazy and a failure, this loud voice, will cease to exist. Just breath, see the beauty of this life, hear the beauty of the sounds, and know that you are so much more powerful than you give yourself credit. 

Finally, if you are beating yourself up for your mistakes, just appreciate the fact that you know they are mistakes. Many of us are coasting through life blindly not knowing the next step to take towards becoming our authentic selves. You have that step taken care of. Proud of you!

0,aez3nv,27,9,"Hi peepz

I now have the idea of posting this thread in order to maybe discuss something I've been going through. It involves a parallel reality in which some seem to be aware of coming up.

I want to give a quick background on who I am, and what I have been through the last few years.

So in 2012 I have had a Kundalini Awakening. After this awakening I've gotten prophetic dreams and visions of past and future. Lot's of information came through, in which I called a sort of ""download"" of information through my mind.

After this blissful period, I fell into a dark night of the soul in which I started hearing voices in my mind. It's not so much hearing voices on the outside as someone is talking to me, but more telepathic thoughts that I could pick up on.

I couldn't really understand why I had these voices, so fighting back for peace of mind turned out to be very difficult and so, as a nurse came to my house, she recommended me to be taken into a psychiatry. Here (where I am still) I started calling it a ""psychosis"". Although deep inside I knew that it was more, I still took the pills in hope they would go.

But they did not. 

6 years later, I'm now coming to the conclusion, not completely yet, but, that these ""voices ""(not only through hearing eg. Body language, eye contact, speech...) come from a parallel reality.

This reality that I speak of is empathic and  telepathic in nature. It's a reality in which thoughts and emotions are used to communicate just as much as vocal and through body language. 

I'm experimenting with this reality, although it is being suppressed by medication, I still am aware that the parallel reality is going on even though I'm not hearing the communication as well as I did a few months ago.

The weird thing with this reality, some that I have asked about this, have or are experiencing this same reality. If it were only me, I'd think i'd have some special gift or something, but there are others who are aware of this reality going on. So I do think that this is a collective phenomenon.

The thing is though, which is also weird, some are not aware of this, yet when I talk to them, it seems as if they are. As if they are still in transition of this ""reality"" to the telepathic reality. (That doesn't mean you disappear in flash of light or something)

The ascension theme also play a very big role in this I think, might I even say sure.

Very interesting it is, and I'm very curious to see how things will fare from here, because I'm definitely going to experiment a bit more.

I know this is post is a bit chaotic, but if there are any question, ***I insist to ask! :)***

0,aeywbx,3,4,"This got long. I added a little bit of background. 

So, this is kinda weird. I’ve been an sceptic. 
One of my dear friends is very deep in alternative lifestyles. Astronomy, rituals, energy, sacred plants. 
She mostly practices prehispanic / Inca stuff (we live in Mexico) 
I’ve been slowly opening myself to new ideas and knowledge. We did a ritual before the new year and I’ve been cleansing with sage, and using more intention and stuff like that. 

I’ve always been very receptive to energy. (Before believing in energy and stuff, I just considered myself really good at reading people or situations) and lately I’ve been feeling this sensitivity is growing. Sadly I’ve been experiencing negative stuff (depression and dark stuff)

This week though a couple of birds made it into my home, in different days at different times. ( I know, it’s nothing special, you just left a window open) that’s the thing, Monday or Tuesday it was kinda chilly and I closed the window. My laundry room has an opening, but that’s been like that for years and I’ve never had any birds inside my home.  Right now, I’m seeing a small bird in my office, playing around and flying around every surface. 
My cat is freaking out. But is not trying to catch it that hard. 

It just feels nice to have life inside my home. Also, today’s is my late dads birthday. 

So I’m kinda freaking out here. Do I take this as just a random thing that happened? Or could this be a sign or something? 

Edit to add: yesterday we were planning on a small trip to go to a peyote ceremony. The timing of the whole thing is weird. ",new,Birds in my home.,4
0,aexgxg,1,10,"One of the greatest obstacles humanity has in freeing itself from its shackles of slavery and finally realizing its full potential is its flawed perceptions about other living beings and Life itself.

We live in a world that is divided on every level, in a world of separation. But what we fail to see is that the cause and culprit of this separation can be found in the minds of every individual that is a part of this planet.

First and foremost, humanity is under the illusory spell that it is somehow separate and even superior to nature. If one looks rationally and intuitively, we can easily see this could not be further from the truth – humanity is not separate from nature, it is a living part of it, an expression of its rich aliveness. But based on its actions and history, one could easily assume that there is no real notion of this in people’s minds, there is no true awareness of this on our planet. The current state of our environment and the destruction of innumerable ecosystems on this planet, as well as our entire biosphere, easily proves this. Even if you are perhaps skeptical of global warming being primarily caused by humans, the oceans are stilled filled with plastic, the rain-forests with their incredibly rich biodiversity are being annihilated, our crops are sprayed with dangerous pesticides ([permaculture for example, provides a wonderful alternative through healthy organic and fruitful farming](https://permaculturenews.org/2009/05/21/permaculture-miracles-in-the-austrian-mountains/) , as opposed to destroying our planet with mono-cultures), the genetic modification of food is affecting our environment, us and the animals we live with, the air we breathe is becoming more and more toxic (going to extremes in certain metropolises – Beijing, Mumbai…), as is the water…

It is the animals, these precious living beings that inhabit this world with us, that we abuse next. From factory farming, to endless scientific experimentation (much of which is wholly unnecessary, can be done in an entirely different manner, or on living humans for that matter – why should animals bear the burdens of our scientific “progress”?), to poaching and encroaching on their natural habitat. We so often treat animals as though they were not beings that have their own right to live, but rather slaves to our whim and perhaps mere machinations, not even truly alive at all.

[The Horrible Suffering of Animals in Factory Farming](https://www.aspca.org/animal-cruelty/farm-animal-welfare/animals-factory-farms)


But we do not stop here – we also abuse and destroy each other, while willingly participating in the conflicts pushed onto humanity by those that financially or otherwise profit from them. From endless wars filled with brutal torture and rape, which our history is chalk full of, to other ancient and modern criminal maladies, like human trafficking, the drug trade and its abhorrent manifestations, to criminal and gang violence, rape, murder and theft. Poverty as a direct result of the inability to distribute basic resources among all humans and the constant exploitation of third world countries by multinational corporations shows yet another side of seeing some people as less than others. Even the more subtle manifestations of our inter-divisions, of our lack of seeing each-other as human are spread out everywhere – from racism in its many forms, to people having no respect for either older people, younger people, men, women, children…all of which can and are dehumanized in various situations (especially in more bureaucratic circumstances, which remain one of the heights of dehumanization) constantly.

[A List of Global Sociological, Political and Environmental Issues Plaguing the World Today](http://www.globalissues.org/issue)


If there is an “elite” group of people that is also participating and encouraging this madness, this separation and division, I do not believe them to be the cause of our maladies. They are merely the ultimate symptom of a problem that is rooted deep within us. The only harm that any such group can cause us, is the harm that we have allowed them to inflict.

From a conscious perspective, all that I have described, all the events that have transpired throughout humanity’s history seem completely insane. If any evolved aliens would be (or are for that matter) visiting this planet, I have no doubt that they would see humanity as a cancer to this world, as a species with a bare minimum ability to learn from its follies and past mistakes, as mad children with constant tantrums, refusing to grow up, burdened with psychosis, psychopathy, paranoia and delusions of grandeur.

**So what is the issue, where does the problem lie? Why do we inflict so much pain to each-other and other living beings?**

At first it seems that much of our problems stem from surface issues, such as an inappropriate social and political structure, a decaying (or many times nonexistent) sense of morality, a lack of education, perhaps no discipline, ill health, or a sense of inner weakness.

Here I would like to propose another cause. *A lack of awareness and a total and complete entrapment in conceptual thought.*

I would like to show you how a lack of awareness, of consciousness and being stuck in the prison of mental labels directly leads to our inability to see anything around us, including ourselves, as actually alive.

Have you ever been to a forest? Or for that matter, any environment that is mostly natural, untouched by humans, filled with an immeasurable cornucopia of animals and plant life? No doubt, most of us have at least been to a park now and then.

How did you feel in such an environment? Did you feel at home, or was it a completely alien experience? Similarly, how do you feel in the presence of any other forms of sentient life – dogs, cats, cows, pigs, birds...or even humans for that matter? And who do you feel most comfortable in letting into your space?

And whatever you feel – have you ever wondered why you feel that way?

What most of humanity is doing whenever it encounters anything is immediately labeling it with their mind. The wonderful tree full of aliveness becomes an oak, the happily chirping bird is a sparrow, even the creature you have at your house is known as a dog and even further, is given a specific name. The human that gave birth to you is your mother, the other one that helped spawn you is your father, the people that you meet in schools are your teachers. The world is full of these people – janitors, hair-dressers, policemen, fire-fighters, musicians, actors…yes, even politicians. People that live in Germany are Germans, or better yet, Europeans. The US is home to Americans. We have black people, white people, Asians…plenty of nationalities, colors and creeds, religions and political parties.

In short, we are living in a world of mental labels.

Now, do not get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with mental labels. They are, on the level of thought, absolutely needed for the functioning of our society and our world in general. We, as humans, have evolved the ability to operate with conceptual thought and it is a very precious gift.


But – have we perhaps lost ourselves in this mental maze?

**How do you know someone or something is truly alive? What is life anyway?**

And perhaps the crux of the matter at hand – is there a difference between having a belief or thought that something or someone is alive and feeling this aliveness with your entire being, knowing it is so without question? Is there a difference between thinking you are alive and feeling the aliveness, the life within yourself? Have you ever truly felt alive at any point in your life? How did it feel?

The history of our science is an intimate struggle between a form of vitalism (where most spiritual and mystical traditions can be placed) and materialism, which sees the world as a fundamentally mechanistic contraption, filled with robotic like beings that answer in a completely deterministic way to their purposeless random existence. For the most part our history, vitalism has had the edge, even among scientific thought -  from Aristotle that claimed all beings had a soul, to a myriad of other scientists and philosophers which thought the same.

Leonardo Da Vinci said: ""We can say the earth has a vegetative soul and its flesh is the earth, its bones are the stones that create the mountains, its soft parts are tuffs...""

William Gilbert, a pioneer in the science of magnetism: ""We consider that the whole universe is animated, that all the globes, all the stars, and also the noble earth have been governed since the beginning by their own appointed souls and have the motives of self-conservation""

Nowadays, materialism seems to be winning, yet even as we probe more deeply into the most fundamental particles of our reality, there is no definitive proof for materialism, thus issues like the problem of subjectivity and the[ Hard Problem of Consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness) still remain to this day.

Can we define life as a series of chemical and physical interactions and whisk away consciousness as the product of brains? Or will the [pan-psychics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panpsychism) prevail, leading us to see the Cosmos as alive in a way that we can scarcely imagine? A tale that mystics have been talking about for millennia.

**But what does our own experience and intuition tell us?**

When we are in the presence of a beautiful tree, or a whole forest, perhaps when we look at a wondrous plant, when we are laughing with a friend, kissing, having sex…when we are deeply intimate with those we care about, physically or otherwise...when our pets come to greet us and our furry friends jump into our lap. When we, for but a moment, see these beings, these forms of life, as not mere lumps of physical matter and chemical reactions, when we do not see them as labels and thoughts in our mind, when we see beyond the roles that we play, beyond the names we give each-other – do we not see something that is truly alive? Can we not feel the presence of Life itself?

I have no doubt that at some point in your life you have experienced this magic. For many, it is a daily occurrence, while some have become lost in the maze of conceptual thinking and do not feel that spark anymore. No matter who you are, I know that deep within you there is a knowing that cannot be explained by a conceptual thought – that both you and the beings surrounding you are actually alive. Not as a thought in your mind, but as a deeper knowing, as an inherent experience that cannot really be described.

If you have lost this sense, do not worry. Nothing that is real can ever truly be lost.

Whether you feel this way or not, I invite you to awaken or deepen your experience of this - by virtue of awareness:

*Whenever you are with someone, be it a human, an animal, a plant, allow yourself to look at them, to notice them without thinking about them. Allow yourself to let go of any conceptual notions about them and simply be present with them, without thinking, judging or labeling. Truly look at them, listen to them, observe, while being present within you yourself. Any thoughts or labels that come can be dropped, let go of for the time being. Allow yourself to be still, allow yourself to embrace the spaciousness, the peace and stillness. Allow your mind to clear and your thoughts to fade. Then see what happens.*

You may not be able to stay conscious like this for long, as the mental narrative will pull you back. But even a glimpse of this, a Satori if you will (as they call it in Zen), will slowly corrode away the hardened shell you have encased yourself in.

By dropping labels and names you will not lose the ability to use conceptual thought – you will instead rise above it (and even gain the ability to use it more effectively). You will see that beyond your thoughts there is a whole different world. People, animals, plants are actually alive. YOU are alive! *They are a part of Life and so are you.*

Perhaps you will slowly (or quickly, perhaps immediately) experience the aliveness that goes beyond even what we label as life, encompassing seemingly inanimate objects such as rocks, dirt, the wind, water...and all there is.

*The moment we label and conceptualize a person, an animal, a plant... and become completely lost in the label, the mere thought -  is the moment we kill the being that is standing in front of us.*

Thus I truly believe that if people experienced the aliveness behind our current mental matrix of reality, a new society and a new way to relate to ourselves and all there is will arise. A new way of inter-being, not based on mere mental labels, but the experience of aliveness that is inherent beyond it.


It is a knowing that slowly arises and is more real than any belief you can muster. All of us already have this knowing to a degree. It is the reason you can empathize with other beings, have normal relationships, have compassion, remain joyful, feel love, truly be internally free and know you are alive.

But most of us have encased it in a hard shell of resistance, dogma and pain. Seeing beyond this shell, beyond our mental walls, is the beginning of freedom and true love. As this happens, your old reality may slowly crumble. Pain may surface, resistance will come up. All of this can be let go of, embraced, accepted, integrated.

Beyond your mind there exists a life, a Sun, a blinding Light encountered on the other side of Plato’s cave. You can bear witness to this and allow it to change your world and your understanding of Life. The journey to seeing this permanently may not be easy, but every mountain with a view so magical is worth the climb.

Plenty of love to you all.

I wanted to gain some input as well as links in regards to this subject.

First, this is all strictly hypothetical as I would never in a million take my own life because I know the grief it would cause for some people. 

With that being said, when an individual dies i have found in my research you are not supposed to go towards the light as it is a trap to keep you reincarnating. Apparently a lot of things will try to keep you here posing as family members, angels, etc and you aren’t supposed to listen to them. Apparently, you are supposed to shield yourself in golden light and then follow your own golden light trail to find a hole in the matrix and once you find that hole and exit you will return to source.

If someone was to commit suicide would they still be able to do this? Just to reiterate this isn’t something I am contemplating doing AT ALL, but I’m curious if the karma accrued by doing this wouldn’t allow you to leave as opposed to if you died naturally (assuming karma is real in the first place).

Is there ever a point where an individual reaches a level to where our captors would let us leave freely? 

Thoughts, opinions and links are always appreciated.

Ive started doing thinking into how much of what we do, say and act upon is dictated by society. I mean, seriously, almost everything. Like the more I pay attention to the subtleties of my mind the more I realize that almost everything I’ve ever done has been influenced in some level by society. Very rarely have i actually done things to not get popularity, acceptance, avoid ridicule, please others, fit in, or make people laugh. 

I’ve never actually subconsciously acknowledged why i do the things i do. In our mind we’re always fixing and addressing problems, but what the hell even is a problem? something that causes pain? Something that we don’t like? And if it is, then its subjective right? What is it defined as? Wheres the source of the problem?

They say money doesn’t equal happiness and they’re right in most cases. Sure money buys food and water, comfortable living spaces and entertainment so we’re not bored. Money makes sure our necessary core emotions of “im cold” “im hot” “im hungry “ “im bored” are taken care of. And thats fine, but what about that new car? Why does that make us happy? To show other people we have money? Is it aesthetically pleasing? If it is why not just get a poster of it? We want to show people what we have. We spend our hard earned money to make other people go “oh wow”.

A lot of us live just for the acquisition of money. People are always working to buy some new thing that they’ve been wanting. New car, new ring, cool little gadget or gizmo. But what happens almost immediately upon getting said thing? We get bored of it and start working on something else. Thats why all rich people aren’t all happy. They realize that theres nothing at the end of that chase. It just leads to more chasing. 

I often find myself playing the ‘why’ game. Some times it ends it ends in a loop, sometimes it goes deeper. I’ve even found myself asking why i play the ‘why’ game. Why do i ask myself why we do the things we do? What am i going to gain from it? Knowledge? What am i going to use the knowledge for? Power? Healing? Harm? Control?

Why do i want knowledge?

He quickly dismisses an interjection Brian makes, using words that in Brian's reality, greatly hurt him. Brian then tries to rectify this in an attempt to see Joe's approval. Joe, in his reality, is unaware of the trigger of the argument and senses only Brian's noting of his own achievements, and in his mind sees Brian as a novice who thinks he's larger than he is. Their relationship is also asymmetrical - Brian sees Joe very differently than Joe sees Brian.

>  
>The **epigenome** is a series of switches that run along the DNA’s double helix that are involved with turning on or off gene expression. Glued to our DNA are thousands of molecules that shut some genes off and allow other genes to be active. Our experiences can physically rearrange the pattern of those switches and, in the process, change the way our brain cells work. This research has a truly exciting implication: It may be possible to rearrange that pattern ourselves and thereby relieve people of psychiatric disorders like severe anxiety and depression. In fact, scientists are already easing those symptoms in mice. The two families of molecules that make up the epigenome are methyl groups and coiling proteins.  
>  
>Methyl groups when attached to genes can prevent it from being read in DNA transcription, thus mask the gene.  
>  
>Coiling proteins are spools that are strung around the DNA. When these spools tighten up, they hide certain genes; adversely, when these spools are relaxed, they allow genes to become **activated**.  
>  
>Also included in this article is the fact that mice with more licks (nurture) from their mother are more curious and brave than mice without much nurture from their mother. Those mice less tended to tend to be more recluse and less curious. The article goes more into detail about this. This shows the power of love from a mother and how important it is for development!

Through epigenetic alterations, our genomes retain something like a memory of the environmental signals received during the lifetimes of our parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and perhaps even more distant ancestors. So far, the definitive studies have involved only rodents. But researchers are turning up evidence suggesting that epigenetic inheritance may be at work in humans as well.""  
>  
>""It changes the way we think about information transfer across generations,"" Whitelaw says. ""The mind-set at the moment is that the information we inherit from our parents is in the form of DNA. Our experiment demonstrates that it's more than just DNA you inherit. In a sense that's obvious, because what we inherit from our parents are chromosomes, and chromosomes are only 50 percent DNA. The other 50 percent is made up of protein molecules, and these proteins carry the epigenetic marks and information."" Ethan Watters

>  
>Take all of this into account with DNA activation. I never really understood what that meant. Now I can say that it involves allowing suppressed genes to be expressed.

>  
>Now, the Finale, thanks for reading all so far. If we have been receiving DNA/genetic information from our ancestors for thousand and thousands of years, who knows how many genes we have that may have been turned off during one of our ancestors lives? Our DNA right now may have thousands of genes switched 'off' We are on the cusp of a new age, many will say--The Golden age. Being at the tail end of the IRON age I would postulate that we have many genes unexpressed and much higher DNA potential. I've heard many speak about how are DNA will once again be activated. Maybe this shift will turn all of our switches back into the on position so we may once again realize who we really are and what we are truly capable. Nothing is impossible.

>To clarify:

>In the study of the first link I posted there was research done where they observed how mice whom received more nurture from their mothers ended up with better character traits and a *physically* bigger hippocampus size in the brain. The mice who were less cared for by their mothers were more fearful of noises and were less courageous and curious--their hippocampus size smaller than the before-mentioned. This means that one case of bad parenting may result in the shutting off of some genes which in turn cause physically smaller brains! READ BELOW TO SEE. When the DNA is copied, the switches stay in place where they were before. It is possible to express these ""shut off"" genes again because our environment seems to be whole lot to do with it.

Those adults who reported in a questionnaire that they had a poor relationship with their mother were found to have hippocampi that were significantly smaller than average. Those adults who reported having had a close relationship with their mother, however, showed perfectly normal size hippocampi. Meaney acknowledges the unreliability of subjects reporting on their own parental relationships; nonetheless, he strongly suspects that the quality of parenting was responsible for the different shapes of the brains of these two groups.**

I believe we are currently right in this. 5G and all the toxicity in our environments impede on this shift going on. People talk about an 'event' or singularity, the second coming, etc..

Recently I've begun charging my water with Love and yesterday I had some insights I want to share with you all.

  


Water is very sensitive to vibrations. If you haven't already heard of Masaru Emotos research on the shape of water molecules in response to the vibrations of words, such as Love and hate, spoken into their glass, then [check it out here](http://hexagonalwater.com/masaru_emoto.html).

  


So, the first reason to charge your water with Love is to positively influence it's molecular shape, and by extension the shape of its vibrations. The information of Love is literally stored in the structure of the water, as a physical memory, and this information is transmitted to other cells through frequency. When a Loving vibration liquid enters your body, all of the places this water travels to change their vibrations to resonate with Love.

  


Excitingly, there are some deeper reasons to explore in regards to the importance of charging water with Love. Here are a few occult laws that are relevant so let's go over them.

  


First, is understanding the fractal nature of reality. Within each circle, the most basic shape, there exists infinity. This can be thought of in two ways. One, is that the dimensions and properties of a circle can only be defined using Pi, which is infinite. Mathematicians may be wary to claim this, but the pattern is obvious: there is always another number.

  


The second way is a very neat visualisation I first saw from physicist Nassim Haramein, which demonstrates that there is embedded an infinite fractal pattern within each circle, which can be followed into repeatedly smaller circles forever.

  


(I can't currently find it online but it's in his documentary Black Whole which everyone should watch)

  


I'm sure many of you are familiar with the flower and seed of life, the sacred geometry pattern of balanced interlocking circles. I have it tattooed on my chest.

  


Phenomenal user u/d8_thc recently described, in his sub r/holofractal, this geometric structure as the shape of spacetime memory foam. My layman's understanding is that this is the shape of the structure of reality, balanced interlocking spheres at the planck mass, which is the smallest unit of measurement/manifestation possible in this Universe.

  


These packets of mass are exceptionally dense for their size, and they meet the size/mass ratio to be considered a black hole.

  


The next law to discuss is a Hermetic law of correspondence, which is almost the same as the eastern concept of karma. Basically this can be summed up as: the energy you put out into the universe will be returned to you by the universe.

  


And the third relevant law is also an Hermetic law known as: As above, so below. It has also been expressed as: the macrocosm reflects the microcosm. Additionally, I have heard it expressed as the outer reality being a reflection of the inner self. One of the exciting implications of this law is that, by changing our inner self positively, we will manifest positive things in our reality.

  


So let's tie these laws together. When we charge water with Love, we are literally sending Love to the Infinite All. Whether you believe the fractal infinity nested within the vibrating molecules of the water is literally a portal to another universe, or rather unmanifested infinity, the implication is the same.

  


This, as above so below, we are, through the medium of water, sending Love to all of creation and our creator.

  


The universe, as part of creation, will then send this Love back to you, thanks to the law of correspondence.

  


It is an exceptionally powerful tool, therefore, to manifest Love in our realities.

  


So, how do you charge water with Love?

  


Everyone can develop their own method, based on what resonates, but here's what I do:

  


I pour my water into a glass cup, and place it on my altar. I meditate briefly, no more than 30 seconds to a minute, in order to focus my energy.

  


Then, I place the water glass between my palms, centered in front of the heart chakra, and visualize Loving energy flowing through my arms and hands into the glass, and also directly from the chakra center.

  


It is not enough to just have a visual of the energy flow, it is also important to have both a genuine appreciation for the water and the life-giving power it contains, and to literally feel Love accompany the visual flow of energy. This can be difficult to accomplish at first, but it's worth persevering to be able to develop the sensation.

  


Next, I place the glass down and do a prayer. I pray to God, angels, spirit guides and my higher self, tell them how grateful I am for the water, that I Love them, and I ask for them to partake in the channeling of Love into the water, to maximize iitd efficacy.

  


I then repeat the visualisation.

  


I always do the visualisation three times, because if something comes in threes, the law is that the third is the most powerful. (“Third time's the charm” is an exoteric expression of an occult truth)

  


Before I do the visualisation a third time, I address the water directly. I tell it how grateful I am that it has chosen to manifest in this form to sustain me and share this moment with me. I speak directly into the water, with the intention of sending powerful sound vibrations, “Te amo, Gracias” ( I learned hoponopono from a peruvian medium so this my go to phrase to give thanks)

  


And after the third visualisation i drink the water. In total it takes maybe 3-5 minutes and I do it ~6 times a day. Alternatively, you could do it to a pitcher of water and use it throughout the day, saying a brief prayer after refilling your cup to recharge the energy.

  


I guarantee everyone who tried this will see results, positive people, things and events manifesting in your life as a form of Love directed at you from all creation.

0,adpgas,28,9,"Hello, you will have to excuse me for using a throwaway, I do not dare post this on my main account  
As the title says, sexual energies is a problem in my life, I feel like being obsessed with sex is something I can discuss nowhere, I feel like people would take me as some kind of monster, a vile monster of lust that lets its prime insticts drive it, but I believe this place to be open-minded, I will try my luck here if I may  
  
I'm basically just sex-obsessed, to the point of doing pickup in my early spiritual days, with success but I quickly stopped doing that because I felt it was not spiritual to go and chase after women and approach them solely for sex, I stopped that, yet I was still tortured by my urges , I did nofap for years, sometimes even going 3 to 4 months without masturbation, regularly I could go one month without masturbation, it worked for awhile until it absolutely stopped worked,the longer I went without masturbation or ""release"" the more my head would be filled with absolutely sexual thoughts to the point of madness, I stopped doing that because I would end up literally just thinking all day about sex, I was just as obsessed, if not even more, way more  
So I restarted practicing self-release, which made things manageable  
Next as my spirituality evolves I see the divine beauty of both men and women alike! You'd think this would make me mature sexually, hell no, now I find nearly all women incredibly attractive and its way more intense, literally the depth of my vision has increased with my 3rd eye making me see people in ultra 3D, women literally look naked, with their clothes on, this didnt help in my case  
  
The result is I am extremely sexually frustrated,  because I have the maturity to stop myself from mindlessly chasing  women and pickup them up for sex, in fact I never do that, I keep my heart open for a genuine love connection, and approaching a girl just to get her in bed doesnt sound right nor does it feel right  
Yet at the same time I am absolutely tortuted by these constant sexual thoughts, Ive begged the universe to be released of them, I can get to know a women and instantly my mind is bombarded with thoughts on how to hook up with her, despite never going through with it, its just there in the back of my mind drilling like a beast so wtf am I supposed to do?  
  
Anyone has got any legit and genuine advice as to how to calm distorted sexual energy?

0,admfrc,7,16,"In the past few years I've used synchronicities as guidance and had some hair-raising (and lifechanging) results but lately they've been piling up and I've just been observing them without any real understanding about what they are for today. And I know this sounds a bit banal, and I feel like I've always known it, but I've been pondering synchronicities for a while and not coming up with a satisfactory explanation, but I woke up this morning with this and it seems right. 

&#x200B;

Synchronicities are a reflection of us synchronizing with the global consciousness that is us, or God, or the universe. The more each of us individually spends time thinking about our invisible connection - i.e. the universe/ God/us.. the more Us becomes aware of each of us individually. So God thinks about you. 

While God is technically conscious - the fact that we're all individually not very conscious of being God or even of God's existence, effectively leaves God thinking about a million different (supposedly) unrelated things. His/her/it's thoughts (i.e. us) are scattered. But us thinking about the nature of God and us, about God's awareness and consciousness and interest in us, and I think also especially about our need for spiritual unity,..  helps God to collect his/her/its thoughts.. (btw I do have a gender preference for God, but that's a different story) This collecting of thoughts is reflected in the synchronizing signs and events. I think that's especially why it feels so electric in the beginning - because that's when we first start to really believe - it's perhaps more exciting for God than for us. 

It acts twofold - one to confirm or affirm that God is listening and aware of us individually, and to encourage us to persist. (Therefore, it can be used as guidance as a means of communicating with God, but as with all God's guidance, the purity and simplicity of your motives and conscience is at play...) 

And two, to remind us that God is listening and needs our attention  to help Us focus on our (collective) needs.

&#x200B;

We, of course, are always in God's thoughts, because we are God's thoughts, but I do think we're coming up to a time when we're collectively aware of that. I love the posts and positivity on this sub. It's so very inspiring. ",new,Synchronicities are us synchronizing.,16

0,adgs28,18,11,"I'm going to try and explain as best I can in a semi-scientific manner the physical changes that are currently underway in our solar system. Hopefully I can dispel the uncertainty behind certain phenomena relating to ""reality shifts"" and astronomical events. 

So basically the interior of the earth is liquefying due to the heating of the core by highly energetic charged particles, aka cosmic rays that are being  partly emitted by our sun and largely originate from outside our solar system. 
Our suns output has been on the low side as you may have heard. Solar wind is essentially an electric current carried by plasma comprised of charged protons and electrons that connects the planets to the sun much like how copper wires transmit electricity to your home through power lines. Ordinarily the earths magnetosphere is in constant contact with this current, which, along with ""blowing away"" any cosmic rays that enter the solar system, actually strengthens and supercharged the magnetic field on the day side, I kinda imagine it like being outside in a cold wind and my bodys metabolism kicking into high gear to compensate and conserve as much heat as possible to keep me warm. The aura shrinks on itself, the magnetic field lines become compact from the pressure and electricity exerted upon it. 

Well now that the suns taking a little break from breaking wind, the earths field lines stretch out more and get ""thinner"", no longer being charged up and compacted. This is allowing highly energetic charged galactic nuclei to enter our atmosphere, and some of the smaller particles just slip right on through the crust and end up at the earths core which basically becomes more and more energetic as more particles pass on their electric charge. 

I won't go too deep on my theories of what the core is actually composed of, but I will say that the core cannot be as hot as we are told by mainstream science, being that ferrous materials lose their ability to magnetize in hot conditions. The excess heat is pulled out and transferred into mountain sized diamonds acting as heat sinks, which continues to transfer the heat into the mantle, melting the crust slowly right underneath our feet. That's why we are seeing so much geological activity, which leads me to the next mystery: being that the core is always spinning faster than the earths rotation and in fact probably keeps the world spinning. As the core becomes more energetized it begins to spin faster, and its magnetic field lines pull the rest of the earth with it, which I believe is the reason our days have grown shorter. 

Also one thing important to note is the ability of magnetic fields to block electromagnetic frequencies, including visible light (inductor shielding) which is exactly what the earths magnetosphere has been doing in order to keep the world going. But if the magnetosphere is now weaker/""thinner"", or even oscillating at a higher rate, it could definitely influence what wavelengths are now let through, which could theoretically change the color of the sun from the perspective of earth, the high oscillations/uncharged field allowing a larger amount of white/lesser amount of yellow to reach our eye.

Now all of this is part of a plan, an OS upgrade, ""ascension"" whatever you wanna call it. The end result of this heating and liquefaction is a dramatic transformation of the earth that never happens if we don't make the same transformation, finding that truth deep within  through a process of remembrance of self, and purpose. Fortunately we are as a whole making that shift now, but it's as I said, the question of ""How many?""can make that transformation? That's all I'm gonna say for now as far as Earth Changes go (I fucking hate typing, I'm nit picky as fuck when it comes to specific word choice, thanks Virgo Ascendant) but ill go more in depth if requested. 

Btw don't ask me for info sources, cause I don't got them; other than the plasma physics most of this was channeled/intuited by me

0,adesop,11,1,"Hi everyone, I’d like to share a spiral-based Theory of Everything that gives a definitive explanation of God and the truth of the values of peace and love, here it is:

https://i.redd.it/z9576voozx821.png

We forever grow towards Godliness, oneness, and our true Self and Heart, becoming nobler, i.e. dedicated to universal, world, and inner peace (complete peace, zero amplitude), and stronger (infinite love, infinity frequency), like a logarithmic spiral forever approaching its origin: 

God is ever-present and unchanging.

Life is the phenomenal universe (maya in Indian spiritual philosophy) and perpetually and exponentially growing oneness with God.

(Beings who’re more one with God than humans are, such as the Creator, beings to whom worlds are thoughtforms, solar systems like atoms, and humans like cells, goddesses and gods, angels, legendary, celestial, magical, and other supernatural beings, extraterrestrials, and spirits, exist in higher and more majestic dimensions, such as heavens. Beings who're less one with God than humans are include animals, plants, and minerals. Growth spans across lifetimes through reincarnation.)

This can be compared to a logarithmic (equiangular) spiral, a shape commonly found in nature.

God can be compared to the origin, infinity.

(The origin is the center point that the spiral converges towards,

ϴ → ∞ using the polar equation r = aeb(-ϴ))

And life can be compared to the spiral, which can be seen as a folded wave.

God, oneness, and Truth are complete peace and infinite love, just as the origin is the Heart at which the wave's [amplitude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude) approaches zero and its [frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency) approaches infinity. 

""And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""

\- Bible

""You see pictures moving on the screen in a cinema show. When you are intent on the pictures you are not aware of the screen. But the pictures cannot be seen without the screen behind. The world stands for the pictures and Consciousness stands for the screen. The Consciousness is pure. It is the same as the Self which is eternal and unchanging.""

\- Ramana Maharshi, Talks With Ramana Maharshi

""Oh Wonder of Wonders...Oh Glory of Glories...Mystery of Mysteries! Life is Eternal. Life just IS...and EVER SHALL IT BE SO!""

\- The Star Maker

I explain more in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emhoLZkUllo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emhoLZkUllo)

Script (edited, notably the gamma brainwave connection marked with the \* too is key):

“This part of the site discusses the ultimate Truth and is noteworthy, so here’s an audio explanation for those who like to listen in addition to reading.

This part of the site uses a logarithmic spiral to explain God, as defined at the top of the “Purpose of Life” page, and life, using geometry and math, which is often considered a universal language, and is largely objective, as compared to words which can be subjective.

In this explanation, God is compared to the origin of a logarithmic spiral, and life, or the phenomenal universe, “Maya” in Indian philosophy, is compared to the spiral.

The first point is that God is our true Self and Heart, as in the ancient Greek saying “know thyself”, and as in the Indian concept of “Self-realization”, and God is the essence of all things, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral is situated at the heart of the spiral.

A second point is that God is the one absolute Truth, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral is the unchanging singularity at which the spiral ultimately converges.

A third point is that God is transcendent, and the ever-changing phenomenal universe and individual soul forever grow towards transcendent God without ever reaching it, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral represents infinity, and a logarithmic spiral forever approaches its origin without ever reaching it.

A fourth point is that God is the Omega and the Alpha, the end and the beginning, both the end goal of evolution and beginning source of life at once, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral represents both the endpoint and beginning point of the spiral, depending on which direction you consider it to be growing, at once.

A fifth point is that God is complete peace and infinite love, just as a logarithmic spiral's rotations' amplitude, or oscillation magnitude, decreases towards zero, and their frequency, or number of cycles per unit, increases towards infinity, as the spiral approaches its origin.   Zero amplitude is complete calmness, in other words complete peace, infinity frequency is infinite power, in other words infinite love, as in passion.  These are the two fundamental qualities of God that go by many names, another pair is receiving and giving, a receptive state is one of calmness and clarity, in other words zero amplitude and complete peace, and to give is to create passion and power, in other words infinity frequency and infinite love.  Accordingly, another pair is the Divine Feminine and Masculine, femininity is about receiving, masculinity about giving.  Another pair is all-pervasiveness, or omnipresence, and almightiness, or omnipotence, again zero amplitude and complete peace relate to receptivity, which is also openness, expansion, and breadth, in other words all-pervasiveness, and infinity frequency and infinite love relate to depth and infinite power, in other words almightiness.  I believe these two qualities are the underlying meaning of yin and yang too.

\*This explanation is corroborated by the connection between spiritual states, including transcendental and meditative states, and gamma brainwaves, the highest frequency category of brainwaves, which are also the lowest in amplitude.

This explanation is also corroborated by a quote from the saint Ramana Maharshi in which he compares a sage to a spinning top.  A theoretical optimally spinning top is both completely balanced and spinning infinitely frequently, infinitely frequent spin enables it to remain completely balanced in spite of perturbing influences, and complete balance enables it to spin infinitely frequently without going out of control.  In other words, its rotations’ amplitude is zero, and their frequency is infinity, just as the origin of a logarithmic spiral represents these two qualities.

Interestingly, UFOs are piloted by spiritually knowledgeable extraterrestrials and function identically, being spinning discs.

This brings us to a sixth point which is that God, the complete and infinite, universal and foundational source of life energy, intuition, and conscience, is the one and only example of perpetual motion, and the ideal, perfectly efficient and infinitely powerful life-giving being to aspire to match, including for collectives, individual souls, and machines such as energy generators and UFOs, just as zero amplitude, complete balance (equilibrium), and complete peace mean complete smoothness, zero friction in the sense of conflict and energy dissipation, zero vibration, and perfect efficiency, and infinity frequency, infinitely frequent spin, and infinite love mean infinite power.

It’s also notable that logarithmic spirals are fractals, which are fundamental to consciousness, and being equiangular and self-similar they exemplify equality, which is closely related to God, oneness, and Truth.

That’s basically the whole truth to religion explained using a fractal, equality-based geometric shape in a way in which everything including God’s status as our true Self and Heart (the essence of all things), the one absolute Truth, transcendent, the Omega and the Alpha, complete peace and infinite love, and the one and only example of perpetual motion, clicks together and makes sense.”

0,ad28wu,31,8,"Hello, 

I am not entirely sure if this the best subreddit to post this in but here goes nothing. 

I have been trying, for the better part of three years, to find myself. A little TMI but whilst in Uni, I became ""depressed"" and subsequently dropped out. I took a little bit of a break and began reading books about Hinduism. However, whilst reading these books, I became incredibly anxious and paranoid, and soon found out I was sick. Nothing too serious but I had a feeling that something was wrong with me so it was nice to have my intuition confirmed. I put the books aside and instead began playing video games and life was great. 

However, the itch started up and I began reading books on Buddhism as well. However, the dread started up again along with it. My intuition flared and I soon found out I was sick, yet again. Like a broken record, I put the books aside and instead did other things. Life was great.

For the third time, I decided to add Philosophical texts to my reading list and lo and behold, I developed anxiety problems and suffered three anxiety attacks in 2018. 

I've considered three possibilities for theses occurrences.

1. I was raised Christian so at first I honestly believed Jesus and/or God was sending me a sign to not delve into other religions/philosophies
2. Nietzsche's quote about the abyss fits into here perfectly. Basically, I thought that negative spirits or entities were trying to scare me into staying ignorant. 
3. It's all just a coincidence and I am just crazy.

I have also researched a bit into Kundalini Yoga and have read about horrible experiences upon opening yourself up when you aren't prepared. 

Has anyone experienced something similar to this that could provide me some insight as to what is going on? I do realize that me posting here will provide biased answers pertaining to my second possibility. Similar to if I had posted this in a Christian subreddit, I would expect biased answers pertaining to my first possibility. Thanks.

I have been doing a lot of energy work full times for the past 4 year trying to heal my physical body. I am now able to feel the energy circulating in my body... all the time... The static/vibration/sparkling in the body is annoying sometime, my crown chakra is hurting... like burning... physically, the connection is too intense? I am not expanded enough? I have to fuse with the upward part of consciousness to fix this? I have tried several thing, laying down and relaxing for hours usually fix the static, But you know in this modern life laying down for hours is not possible all the time... I feel like you got to reach the ''Wavy body feeling'' to be comfortable... but it's way harder while doing stuff in 3D. Tapping help but am I really suppose to tap ''all the time'' just to be comfortable with all that static? Any suggestions? Appreciation does feel like a softer vibration.  


Anyway, I've reach the point where I don't know what to do with all that energy. How am I suppose to heal the physical body? I can feel that the physical pain is linked to energetic blockage, but how am I suppose to unblocked those blockage? Focus the energy in the pain? Try to push after the pain? Expand the vibration upward, behind, under? Most book aren't really clear about how to use energy to heal the body part, they all say : it's not you it's source/God doing it. 

  
No, my kundalini is not raised, I felt it move once, turning around the stomach... ''making space'' It seems crazy powerful, am I suppose to raise that over my head?

Also, I can't love anymore, I am not sad, I can still feel the appreciation emotion, but It's like I don't remember how to ''love'' on demand. Where can I learn how to ''love''?  In the astral realm?

People in the world, especially ""spiritual"" people, often talk about trusting in the universe, and how important it is. I'm at a really dark time in my life. I just don't see how I can trust the universe, if the universe is what put me here in the first place. There have been times in my life where I was incredibly trusting of the universe, and shit still went sideways. How can I trust a universe that gave cancer to my mom?

I also can't abide this idea that every bad thing that happens is a ""lesson"" or some sort of test. I've just had so many devastating things happen that are very real, and don't have anything to do with a mutherfucking lesson. Unless the lesson is to give up (and I don't mean metaphorically, like give up the ego, because even if that worked or was real, plenty of suffering people are trying and failing at that too) because life sucks. And I don't mean to make it about me - there are plenty of people in this world with pain and struggles too heavy to bear. The universe really can't find any other way to teach people? And many people with vastly difficult lives don't learn lessons - it can turn a sweet innocent child into an abusive or abused, selfish, sad or angry criminal.

I remember becoming very sleepy mid way through Daniel interpreting a dream for the King about future generations. I put my bible down and went to sleep almost immediately. I remember dreaming and starting to question things, I woke up because I felt like I was becoming aware of the fact I was dreaming. The second time I fell asleep, I felt instantly aware that I was dreaming but it felt like I was just witnessing something,  I was a ghost to the dream.

It felt like a temple in the Earth or like I was looking down a hallway, deep within a pyramid. My body felt like it was in floating down the hall almost in an autopilot like fashion, but at the same time I felt so In control and aware of what I was doing. I remember the walls of the hallway slanting in the  in a   /     \   fashion, and opening up into a slightly bigger area of the temple/pyramid. When I got to the end of this I could clearly see a wide set of stairs that didnt go very far up (not many steps at all) that led to two large doors inbed in the stone. On either side of the stairs were large stone rails, at the bottom of each sat a very unsettling bald humanoid crouched and resembling the sphinx statues. All along their body they had markings, and their color resembled the color of the temples itself. (Almost like the color of wet beach sand). Like I said earlier about moving in autopilot, I found myself off to the left side of the room staring at the human-like statues. The doors opened and shortly after two Humanoids that looked like clones of the statues, yet on two feet instead of in the sphinx posture. They held some sort of rod in their hands, and they stopped at the top step on either side.

All of them looked identical; they were bald, looked to be made out of the same material as the temple, and something about them was causing an odd feeling in my stomach. I felt like a spirit watching it all, they couldnt tell I was there at all, and just stood like they had suddenly become stone themselves. A third of these came out  dressed differently than the soldiers, and it looked to be some sort of priest or royalty; it was draped in some sort of vibrant red and gold robings, and carried a rod with some stone on the end. What I was watching began to feel like a ritual, the creature began speaking in a language I do not understand with its rod raised,  I was able to physically feel the presence of the dream shift as this went on. All at once a new emotion dominated my senses, my mind exploded like my body was warning me: I felt scared that they might somehow see me, even though I had been floating a few feet from them the entire time. I assured myself that it was my dream, and they couldnt see me, and that there was no reason to be afraid of a dream, but that was the exact moment the priest(or whatever it was) turned his head just slightly, and locked eyes with me.

I have seen someone I love almost die, and it is the worst stomach drop you can endure, the feeling is horrible, this is the feeling it gave me when it looked at me. It's gaze froze my body, I didnt want to believe it could see me, and I looked away,  only to find the humanoid sphinx's staring at me with the guards. The things I believed to be statues stood, and began their way towards me. I don't think I have felt a fear like that ever, awake or asleep, and shortly after I woke up breathing very hard.

This is a dream that has stuck with me for two years, the setting, creatures, and the presence I felt made me very uneasy.

Discern, be pure beings of light, you do not need to do anything you don't want to do until you feel the time is right.

0,acey5x,29,5,"Hey all,

I just found out this sub reading about some stuff in the r/holofractal. Seems a nice place to discuss synchs and their interpretations.

I would like to know your views on synchs... I mean, why do they occur? I can think of at least 4 plausible explanations to the things I observe (like a generalistic agnostic line of thought that RAW mentions):

-Manifestations of our own conciousness through law of attraction or magick, which involves emotion, energy, vibrations and attention;

-Beings from other orders orchestrating them to feed on negative emotions (you might name archons or tricksters, idk)... like the matrix control system some talk about;

-Signs from God or then the Higher Self;

-A dispute of egregores trying to gain power over you.

I am more prone to interpret them as the first bullet point, as I observed very unlikely manifestations related to the topics I was worrying/obsessing about it, but I don't embrace any of those views with 100% certainty. 

Also, I would like to know your beliefs on God. Is it something about our own conciousness? Is it the Abrahamic God? Any other? That being said, how do you deal with the dogmas of mainstream spirituality? I mean, do you practice 'sinful' stuff like casual sex or feel proud about yourself and like some glory? Or do you keep trying to kill your ego and live a virtuous lifestyle?

I would love to see your views on those questions.",new,Your thoughts on synchronicities and God?,5

War and poverty would not exist if we didn't allow it to. 

There is a grand conspiracy enacted by ancient bloodlines to dominate the world and cause as much suffering as possible. 

This is literally an act against god in the sense that god is literally everything we can percieve

This is all a game, and we are all the players that matter, this world as a whole, is literally fuckin hell right now, I know the bible says the skies are heaven and the underworld is hell, but I argue heaven and hell are actually possibilities we can and have met throughout our histories. 

I argue we are here for a purpose, all of us have been born into some sort of hell, but with the not so occulted knowledge we can and have gained from this very sub, we have the means to create a true harmony, on earth. 

**Fear the new world order**. 

Fucking fear it, that terrifying concept of something new compared to the current world order.... 

Now is the time to stand up to the *globalists*, now is the time we preserve this *old world order*..... 

My fuck, I see this programming in not just my home town, the hived mind runs deep.... 

**Fear the open borders, fear the open imaginary lines** 

God damn fucking savages I tell ya, right now, specifically the muslims... 

Why the fuck do we want them in our beautiful cancercrete cities, when all they do is rape, pillage and knock down our steel and cancercrete *babel* like towers with **aluminum** weapons of mass destruction. 

I don't personally know any humans of the muslim faith, but I see them in real life walking their kids to canadian schools...

Those fuckers! 

How dare they bother learning our *given* history... 

Open *borders*, fuck that right? 

Don't let the savages past the gates, draw your swords, ready the archers.... 

Make sure you make a farcebork post on a farcebook group to show you are against letting fellow humans into your dystopia.... 

Open borders, my fuck do I ever agree with them, let no chains bind any man, or woman, or even the deluded that are unsure whether or not to put their cock on the *guillotine*. 

Surely, when we see of where these ""immigrants and terrorists"", come from, we see fucking hell, and my fuck, my heart really does go out to all those affected, even the terrorists, because I know their lives have been an absolute hell since they emerged out of the dust.... 

And we're all going back to the dust one day... 

**Our dear manufactured ideologies** 

When looking down from a dock, it is easy to see why it is called a school, and when looking down from the *towers* of Babel, it is easy to see why they call it a ""yellow vest"" movement.... 

Bumbling little bees buzzing inside the hived mind. 

That's all we have become, stuck arguing one manufactured ideology over the other, while actually not coming up with anything new... 

Conservat*ism* vs liberal*ism*, social*ism* vs capital*ism*, athe*ism* vs the*ism*.....

All these fucking *isms* serve as blinders. 

All isms divide and they all conquer. 

Truth is, our modern western societys are built apon parts of all the isms.... 

Hate socialism? But love public schools and free healthcare? Guess what, you are retarded. 

Hate capitalism? But love spending monies at the local coffeeshops and bookstores? Well guess what, you are retarded, congrats... 

But forgive them lord for they know not what they've done. 

While I do blame each and every one of you(aswell as myself), I know better then to hate you for it.... 

As I said, schools, isms and divide and conquer, our unoriginal ideas that we cherish, have all been simply forced apon us. 

We don't have *much* choice when it comes to all that we think we know, since the day we are born we are fed more needles than keith richards has taken in a single day, maybe even a week. 

We are placed in the cancercrete boxes at a very early age, and taught one thing, to listen to authority, authority is always right, 2+2=5, why? Because authority fucking says so. Control the language, control the mind. 

Now I'd like to talk about nationalism, patrionism. 

Oh canada, our home and native land, true fuckin lies and terrorism... 

Sure I love the land, I am truly blessed to be born where I was, but to pledge allegiance to this god forsaken *crown* is, retarded to say the least. 

Yet every *assembly* in school required me to sing the anthem, to pledge my allegiance. 

This is where we are led so fuckin astray. 

We are never taught the cost of living this *free*(whatta fuckin joke). 

We are here because the crown slaughtered many, in order to colonize the land, everytime we sing that *anthem*, we are forcing ourselves to forget this fact. 

Canada was built apon the death of many innocents. 

So sure, you love the land, you love your choice of pepsi or coke, but do you really love your *history*? 

My friend is one of them bleeding heart liberals, ashamed to be born with the white skin, my fuck do I love my friend, but my fuck has he ever been led astray. 

Racism... Another pre-manufactured ism, and trust me, in my younger years I thought it was cool as fuck to make fun of the other tribes, but the world of conspiracy quickly showed me how I was fuckin retarded. 

You put 2 babies together of any race and creed, and they will grow up to be friends, that is the beauty of a real community. 

Divide and fuckin conquer, our potential is huge without those 2 words. 

Unity is a must if we wish to end this dystopia, and imiginary lines are nothing close to unity.

**More and more methods of control** 

I'm all over the place, forgive me, I've spent 99% of my life poisoning my own mind, and if it weren't for this beer in my hand, that number would shrink over time... 

So, we've discussed fish, I mean people in schools, aswell as the different pre-manufactured *isms* we've been taught to literally fight for. 

Let's talk about terror*ism*, using fear for political gain. 

Even a politician not involved a hoax, or an actual catastrophy, but capitalizes on that, is a terrorist... 

And that's the truth, our govern-mentus, is filled with terrorists. 

Much of what we see in our media is completely fake, sometimes holly-wand will even make movies to further cement tragidy in our minds. 

More often than not though, these 'catastrophies' are complete hoaxes, or they are just false flags, meant to rile up the populace for acceptance if the next war. 

I will never claim I know the absolute truth of anything, but I sure as fuck can see the bullshit in *presented* logic we are fed by the master birds.... 

Either way, we are bound together.... Our tribe is bound together by lies. 

This is the revolution of my post, we've came full circle, we are back to them fucking muslims, knocking down our Babel towers. 

That is what a revolution is, it starts where it ended, but I do not seek revolution, I seek evolution. 

September 11th really is a great example of the lies, it was the kickstart of our current realities, they said hey look, terrorists, and we said okay as we gave up more rights... 

**Is it all fucked?**

You're fuckin rights this world is all fucked. 

How long do you really think this bubble is going to last for? 

I just watched ""The Circle"" for a second time today, and my fuck did this horror film ever terrify me... 

Not because of the inevitable loss of privacy and freedom, but because of the ignorant laughter and happyness portraid... 

If I were born elsewhere, you could be damn fuckin sure, I'm coming to destroy all that you have.... 

The way we live our lives currently, breeds war, poverty, human trafficking, etc... 

There is no fucking innocent bystanders... 

**It's not all fucked though** 

This crazy fuckin world I tell ya, perhaps I'd be happier forgetting what I've learnt and putting my head down while I worked.... 

Taxes are literal theft, if we controlled our banks we could continue printing 'let it be'(fiat), and we could pay the workers for their work, without attaching debt.... 

Monies, one eyes, only worth anything because we allow it... 

It all boils down to us, poverty, war, human trafficking, drug abuse, all only happens because we sit down, and allow it too. 

There would be no crack/heroin addicts if we didn't allow our governments to ship it in... They make fuckin hollywand movies about this... To deny this admits your mental handicap.... 

Tis impressive, but I'm still mad. 

The answer is to break this system from the inside and completely scrap it, build anew... 

Standing on the side of the with partisan signs won't do fuck all, blocking highways, won't do fuck all but hurt us, because we need to fuckin eat.... 

And there it is, the first fuckin solution, feed eachother, feed those who can't... Not just the vets, but everyone... 

This life has meaning, we are not star seeds, we are soul seeds, and our true purpose is to **create** heaven on earth....

0,acazib,7,13,"For those who want to experience higher levels of dimensions, or rather higher levels of consciousness, you must first accept the notion that we are all one consciousness. And that is all the higher dimensions are, different levels of consciousness.  

You might say you’re not aware of these dimensions therefore they don’t exist, but they do. Your guardian angels are just a different level of consciousness. And much like your subconscious, that breaths and blinks for you, your guardian angels (or spirits or whatever you’d like to call them) are affecting you, much like your subconscious guides you even if you are not aware of it. That is, because your spirits are apart of you, in a higher level consciousness that *you*, or perhaps I should say *we*, are not aware of. 

So what must we do to achieve our higher dimensions (or higher levels of consciousness)? We must match our frequencies to that of love and compassion. That is the frequency at which the fifth  dimension operates in. Interconnectedness and pure love. It also means not holding onto the past or future, when we live in the fifth dimension we are living in the now. 

For those who struggle with skepticism and left brain thinking (for which I suffer from greatly) another method will be invaluable to achieving these higher dimensions, and that method is awareness. Awareness of your feelings, thoughts, emotions. Have you ever actually paid attention to where that random thought comes into your head from? Thats your higher consciousness guiding you from beyond a level of your awareness; much like how you breath and blink without realizing it. 

Eventually we will start to ascend to the fifth dimension. A higher level of thinking and processing, a truer and more genuine self. 

Tldr: If you want to experience higher levels of yourself you must leave fear behind and you must become aware of your thought processes. Awareness, love and living in the now are all essential part of ascending.

So I feel too weird telling my friends and family about this, but weird things happen no matter where I am, even though my presence shouldn't directly impact them. Sounds pretty innocent and boring but please keep reading. This affects mainly electronics, but nothing is off the table. Bear with me, this might be a long story.


Just a little background, I've never done any psychedelics or drugs more intense than weed so I don't believe that any of this could be related to lasting effects of drugs that mess with your mind. Also haven't been diagnosed with any mental issues so I don't think I sound delusional or anything but who knows. The lack of psychedelics will be important later.
TL;DR at the end :)


So I started noticing this weird stuff three summers ago in 2015. I had just moved in with my aunt for the season to find a job in the city and life was good. The day after I moved in, she started complaining that her TV was making a buzzing noise and static kept flashing on and off the screen constantly which had never happened before. We tried turning it off, unplugging it, hitting it, all of which helped for about 5 minutes then it would return again. After about a month we decided it was getting ridiculous and she called in the cable guy to see if it was the connection. He rewired /everything/. It continued. In the fall I left to go back to school and she said it pretty much ended.


That same summer, probably one of the weirdest things in my life had happened twice to be exact. In the first month that I was in the house my aunt and I were hanging out together in her office when we heard a loud crash which we weren't phased by because she has cats. The only thing is that the crash came from near the front door and there wasn't anything near there that could have made that sound. So we run over to see glass all over the ground at the front door, and look up to realize her glass globe lighting fixture has fallen from the ceiling! That's not super creepy or anything, but to get from where it was hanging to the floor at the door, it would have had to drop onto the metal stairs bannister intact, roll five feet, and fall a metre onto the floor. Had it done that (already sounds impossible imo) it would have shattered into relatively large pieces because of the low velocity impact, falling from only a few feet up but this thing was shattered into sand basically. So we get creeped out, joke about ghosts, and move on.


Later in the summer she had to go away on business for nearly a month and I was alone to look after the house and go about my life. One night as the irresponsible teen I was, I stayed up watching the static-y TV and fell asleep on the couch which was pretty typical. By this time we had replaced the light fixture in the entryway and it was pretty much the same as the old one. The couch was just in the next room over so anything going on in the front of the house was pretty loud and echo-y. I woke up the next morning pretty early, and still in my PJs I walked to the bathroom to brush my teeth. On my way there I stepped in a pile of crushed glass and the shit hit the fan. I bolted to the kitchen for the phone and cried like a baby on the phone to my grandma (who lived nearby) about what was going on. She bolted over to help me clean up the mess and I was inconsolable. The new light fixture had fallen sometime in the night without me hearing (I'm a light sleeper) five feet away to the door where the last one had. After she left that evening I became insanely paranoid until my aunt came home.


Fast forward to the next summer when I returned for work again. A lot had happened between the summers of 2015 and 2016 so I'd matured a ton by the time I went back to live in the city, but I felt totally irrational for the better part of the summer. Early on I discovered that my favourite thing to do was cycle at night. It started out of necessity when I was craving something from the store I'd hope on my bike at like 10 or 11pm, but I started enjoying it so I went out every night and just darted around for usually an hour or two. This helped me explore the neighbourhood and I soon discovered my favourite spot. It was a field between two sections of a suburb that was facing the opposite side of the valley which was all woods. Pretty relaxing, I often saw deer and other animals hanging out there. One night (here comes crazy) I was just sitting on my bike taking a breather, looking around at how nice everything was when something caught my eye in the sky. It was a light literally sparkling every colour super quickly and moving in the most unpredictable pattern that I'll never forget. At the time I didn't have anything to closely look at it and my phone's camera was horrible so I had no way of 'zooming in', but it was travelling in one direction all while going up and down and darting from one point on it's trajectory to the next in the blink of an eye. It creeped me out so much I rode home as fast as I could and basically broke down sobbing at the door. My aunt asked what was wrong and I tried my best to explain to her what I saw. She didn't really believe me (nor did I) so the next day I went out and spent a significant amount of my paycheck on heavy duty binoculars.

The next night I went back to the field, knelt down and balanced my binoculars on my bike seat so I could keep them steady. I saw it again flashing colours I've never seen on an airplane (purple, blue, red, green, white, yellow all at once). It would travel straight up, forward, down on an angle, and then up again over and over while going in one direction. This time I knew my eyes weren't playing tricks on me so I filmed it with my phone through the binoculars and went home with my hair on end. 


About a week later I convinced her to drive out there with me to see if she could see the same thing. I gave her the binoculars but she saw nothing when I pointed it out. We stayed for about ten minutes in the road there with only lights from the street lamps and then decided to go home. Just as we both turned to get back in the truck we saw something that still makes me tear up two years later. Literally RIGHT behind trees that were no more than 59 feet away was a massive triangular *thing* coasting through the air with one light on each point. Saying we flipped was an understatement. After watching it for a few seconds it literally disappeared. In the blink of an eye it looked like it turned so that only one light was visible and went in the direction away from us. I jumped in the truck and we silently drove home. That one we both saw and as farfetched as it sounds, I know a giant gray triangle in the sky when I see one.
The rest of the summer was pretty uneventful aside from my nightly rides to the field, where I made my peace with whatever I was seeing. 


The only other thing that happened was one night when I got into bed and drifted to sleep I woke up a few minutes later to my blanket coming off me. I tried pulling it back onto myself but it kept getting pulled under the bed. I literally pulled with all of my strength but it would NOT come. Thinking nothing of it (for some reason) I turned on the light and looked under my bed thinking a trapped one of the cats in my room by accident as the door was closed. Nothing. Totally unfazed (which is weird to me now considering how weird it was) I went back to sleep only to wake up AGAIN to the sounds of really high pitched talking. I couldn't make out any words and I remember specifically thinking ""wow I hope this doesn't happen at work in the morning"". 


Later in the fall when I was back home the pedagogic hallucinations (as I learned they were) happened four times again - once as scratching inside the walls, once as talking downstairs, once as a phone vibrating in the room over, and once as the sound of rustling fabric in the corner of my bed. The first time (late afternoon) I asked my mum to come up to my room and hear the scratching (nothing). The second time I went downstairs to see if she was talking on the phone but she was upstairs in her room sleeping. The third time (around 3pn) it was only my sister and myself home at the time so I went to see why her phone was going off so much, but it was on silent and she hadn't heard a thing. That went on for the rest of the day, one 'vibration' every two seconds without fail (I counted) for the next nine hours. The fourth time I could barely describe what I was hearing so I just left it alone, but it sounded like if a tiny invisible animal was running in circles in the corner of my bed. The only time before that year that I can remember anything similar was as a kid I was sleeping (it was about 7pm) when I woke up to the sound of empty boxes falling over in the hallway upstairs. I went to check what it was because the hall was empty when I was put to bed and there was nothing there. (Important: my house was not haunted, my parents built it on land that hadn't been previously lived on.)


Since then small things had kept happening like my stuff disappearing (no matter where I was living at the time), every single one of my computers dying in a weird amount of time (I had three in less than a year) for no reason, and other things barely worth remembering. 


And now this past year a lot has gone on (again) and I'm living permanently in the city with my aunt.
I've learned about HPPD (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder) from an acquaintance, and come to the conclusion that I have it. I have visual snow in every lighting situation that makes everything look like it's mildly buzzing, and my tinnitus is deafening, but just as I'm realizing that they're not actually normal and not everyone experiences it, I'm realizing that I've had this since I was a kid, especially the minor visual stimuli. I used to not have the visual snow but had ""drifters"" in my vision all the time but at some point that changed. However my tinnitus has always been there and really strong (I can hear it over people talking, over TV, over music, over the noise of the car amor bus, etc) and I'm looking into treatment for it.


I've also learned about the joys of nature!
A block from my aunt's house is a conservation area with trails and valleys and rivers which I've started hiking, mostly alone. I always tell here where I'm going, share my location, and keep my data on just in case, although it's a pretty busy place on nice days. One day I felt a bit more adventurous so after my usual route I walked across the suburb to the other side of the forest to explore new trails. A couple dozen feet after entering the new trail is a path that goes down into a valley with a creek that I decided to go down. Had a great time and vowed to go again. The next day I went to explore more and literally the second I got into the valley and across the creek I was winded and could barely see. I'm not anemic, dehydrated or malnourished, or anything else that could have caused that, but I had mad blurry tunnel vision, my hearing was off, and I just suddenly felt very drunk. Thinking it would pass I drank my water and had a snack, and continued on my trail which went from the valley to the top of the nearby hill, but it got worse so I turned back and went home to rest. 

That scared me away for a while, but when I finally decided to go back it happened again. Shortness of breath, jerky walking, can't see properly, it all happened again. I'm avoiding that part of the forest now because I'm pretty sure I'm not welcome there. 


The two things recently that have prompted this post are as follows. The first one was minor, the second seemingly the same but not really. I went home last week to visit my mum and sister in their new house, and a couple hours after I got there the wifi turned to crap. We had to reset it about five times for it to work properly, and then it went back to being terrible the next day. They say it's never happened, only that day when I got there, and when I asked how it was after I left my sister said it was great. That happens literally at everyone's houses that I visit.


The second happened tonight. My computer has been acting up so I decided to take it to Best Buy soon to get it checked out and for that I needed my receipt that shows that I have computer care. I know they can look up my account, I just wanted to have it anyways. Back when I bought my computer I gave the receipt to my aunt to take care of because I was afraid I was going to lose it which was pretty likely. So tonight I asked her if I could have it and she said she would find it in her very well organized files. This OCD-diagnosed woman has kept every invoice, bill, bank book, and important receipt from the past decade and hasn't lost a single thing so I trusted she would come up with it in a few minutes. Hours later and she has nothing which was insane because I would trust her with the archives of the history of humanity, she's that organized. It may sound like nothing but out of all the hundreds of pieces of paperwork she has, my specific paperwork went missing and nothing else. Only mine.

I had friends (recently moved to a new area and not in college for another few weeks so it’s been lonely), I went to work, I smoked some, coolin around Dallas. Suddenly I came home and my parents went outside. I closed the door and went into my room and noticed almost immediately that my footsteps made the exact same sound as my door closing. Then I bumped into my chair, same sound. I had this strange thought with no words attached, just a feeling of release, like when you finally got that toy or game you wanted for so long as a kid. At the same time I was afraid, because I saw that the rules that made everything make sense were changing.

Because I knew (sort of) what was happening, I picked up a shirt and dropped it. Same sound, and it reappeared in my hand. I threw it down. Same sound, same volume. This time it dropped on my head and made the same sound. Suddenly another thought: this reality is ending. A sound played out, like a high frequency low pitch vibration, and my head felt another release, one of relief. I’m not crazy. Everything is cool. Then my head fell back and my feet left the ground but I stayed where I was, like I was in a pool but I didn’t have to tread water to keep above it. I wanted to show my mom and her boyfriend, first and foremost, because I was afraid to be alone.

I went through the walls into the living room to find them before I realized they were outside. I could have gone to them, but for some reason when I started floating that fear, that crippling painful anxiety kicked in. I don’t know what was scaring me, but I felt like someone was about to hurt me, so like I said I didn’t want to stay alone.

So, when I was in the living room, I decided I wouldn’t be scared a second longer, and I closed my eyes and woke up in my bed. No notifications on my phone. No weed. Nobody about to hurt me. Just me, and I felt relieved for a second even though I felt like I had wasted a chance to experience something beautiful",new,You are ending,2

0,abxykl,13,6,"Really not sure if this is my subconscious or something else. Sorry for the long post.

My cousin died of an overdose a little over a year ago. We were raised together and were very close when we were younger, but had kinda drifted apart. We used to party pretty hard together, but I outgrew it while he kept going. Still, I think I was one of the people he felt closest to. We both worked with our now decreased Grandpa on his ranch, which is a pretty close and unique bond.

I almost immediately started dreaming about him. Usually it's just some normal scenario - maybe working or partying like the old days. Occasionally the dream is quite lucid. I ask him all sorts of questions but almost never remember the answers. The first dream after he died was like that. I cried hard and told him I loved him and apologized for all the ways I'd let him down. It seemed so real. I know I asked him if he'd seen our grandpa, but can't remember the answer. I always wake up feeling like I've been around him.

I had a rather lucid dream about him last night. I remember very intentionally trying not to wake up so I could talk to him longer. I don't remember what I asked him, but do remember him saying that he was fine but very bored. 

The ""bored"" part kinda freaks me out. The mind reels at what that might mean.

I've told people that I dream about him, but it's hard to describe how close he feels. I told my wife that is like there's a close alternate reality where he didn't die. Last night's dream felt even closer than that. I actually tried to post this right after waking up, but fell back asleep. I really wish I'd taken some notes.

Does anyone have an explanation for this? I actually rather enjoy getting to see him, but I'd hate to think somethings preventing him from moving on. I'm sure I've asked him if I can do anything for him, but I've never woken with anything in mind.

Thanks for any responses, I just had to discuss it somewhere. ",new,Keep dreaming of a recently deceased relative,6
0,abxh2a,39,46,"When I started this life I didn't know what I had gotten into or where I really was, now I do and I would like to share my truth with you.

I've been an introvert as long as I can remember and I've felt heavily disconnected with the world for almost all my life, with a few exceptions of course. I was born to a Hindu family in India, they were always very religious. I took part in many religious traditions and praying to different Hindu gods and going to the temple all my childhood. Despite the religious convictions of my family they placed a lot of value in my education and gave me the best resources they could in order for me to be an informed person and for me to develop an independent view of the what the world was.

By my teenage years due to my conventional education path I had denounced any idea of a god and even though I participated in all my family rituals because of my respect towards them, it never felt real to me, it always felt fake, like everybody was putting on a front, like god was an excuse for most to do what they want by bending ideologies to their liking. The idea that somebody out there was passing judgement on every single action of my life, let alone everybody else's life seemed far fetched to say the least and to be honest, it felt quite pretentious. This forced me to have a strongly materialistic view of the world, although I will admit that didn't feel like it was quite the answer too. In my alone time and when lost in my own thoughts the question of how a physical brain could give rise to a conscious experience always bothered me. Wouldn't something conscious have to have guided the process of evolution in order for consciousness to arise out of it? This is famously called the hard problem of consciousness in philosophy for anybody who would like to look into it. Anyways, I am not here to debate on this.

As I grew older my family prospered and we had to move to different cities around the world for job opportunities and so I ended up spending around 3-4 years in Dubai and 2 years in Singapore and we moved to the US when I was 13 and I've been here since then. I gathered a lot of experiences by a young age and i saw a good portion of the world, it was a blessing. We were quite well off when we were living in Dubai, Singapore and India but when we moved to the US it all seemed to come crashing down, I learned how fleeting money truly was in life and how easy it was to lose it especially when you're trying to hold on to it all so tightly, with all you got. I was learning to enjoy the unpaid pleasures of life during this time: food, nature, travel and most of all, the love that I had. I was always very attached to my family but it was during this time that I was truly realizing the worth of family and the pricelessness of love.

One fateful day during this time of my life I was casually scrolling through reddit and stumbled upon somebody describing a DMT trip and it peaked my interest. I had never read anything like it, it seemed unreal. Entities? God? Hyperspace? Being outside of your body? I was very interested in learning more about it. In the following months I read a lot of trip reports and then one day when I couldn't take the anticipation anymore I decided I would figure out how the onions work and get me some DMT. Mind you I hadn't even properly tried weed then let alone any other psychedelics. I was going to do DMT. A couple weeks later when I finally got my hands on it, I was anxious to try it so I got a few friends together, some who wanted to do it also and we all did it. I went last. Smoking around 70 mgs of DMT off a dab rig, I felt pins all around my body and suddenly it all went black, I saw a huge ball of light burst into a billion different fractals and then a lot happened that I honestly didn't quite remember when I came back. I woke up and looked at everyone around me, they looked worried. Then a friend asked me *""Are you okay bro??"".* He asked me this because apparently it had only been around 2 minutes since i had taken the hit and I was back up and talking and everybody else who had gone before me was out for at least 10-15 minutes. I said yes I'm okay but then suddenly I remembered the only thing I remembered from that trip. A voice in my head spoke, a voice not my own ***""It's all you""***, I asked my friend to pass me a notebook that was laying on my desk and I swear to god it was the hardest thing i'd ever done but I wrote down whatever that voice said starting with a really big ***""It's all you""*** covering almost half the page. The voice told me to write down a bunch of other stuff that I ended up writing on that piece of paper. I still have that piece of paper. I wrote down a trip report about this around two years ago on this subreddit and will share the link to it at the bottom of this post if you want to read about it in further detail.

The next morning I was still processing what had happened and I called my mum and I ended up breaking down and crying about a lot of shit that I didn't even know was inside me. This is where my journey with psychedelics started, after this experience I tried LSD, shrooms and molly but I never quite went back to DMT. To be honest I never had the courage to. As I delved deeper into my psyche using these tools, my questions grew. Almost at all moments of the day I found myself wondering about the state of consciousness. I had about 3-4 experiences with LSD and about the same with shrooms in the following two years of my life. I had dug myself into the rabbit hole of trying to figure out what reality is. It was hell not knowing who I really was, where I was and how long I had really been here. My last shrooms trip was particularly challenging. I didn't understand anything, I was just very confused, I kept asking my cousin who I had asked to tripsit me where I was, what I had taken, how long i had been like this and how long it would last. I even remember thinking to myself who I even am and I didn't seem to recall my name. I tried to remember my parents and couldn't remember what they looked like. I was very scared and so I decided to go in my room and just lay down waiting for it to pass, I remember thinking that I had always been like this and that time itself was fake and a construct and I was always just tormenting myself looking for the answers to these questions. After that I remember thinking that maybe there is a reason that I don't have the answers to all my questions and I should stop seeking them out, that maybe the point of it all was to just live in the moment and create your own time, create your own reality. I really wish I had taken the lesson the shrooms taught me that night and stopped there but I guess the heart wants what it wants. For 2-3 months after this I didn't trip at all, I just smoked weed and pondered my questions with no courage to go back to it. I constantly found myself wondering ***""What really is reality?""*** and this question had ruined my life and my productivity for the last 2 years since the original DMT trip. It still was. I wasn't productive and I wasn't doing the things I should have been doing because I was always distracted by the questions in the back of my mind. I didn't want to live like this anymore and I could feel myself being drawn away from the drugs, I could see how it was ruining my life and I wanted to stop.

At this point I had only done DMT the one time before. I decided I would do a breakthrough dose of DMT and if it answered my question then okay but if not then this is where my quest with these tools would end. I was going to move away from the city I was living in and so I thought it was fitting that I end this journey here before I move to the new city and start fresh. I have asthma and so its really hard for me to hold in hits for a long time and for this reason it seemed almost impossible for me to breakthrough with just DMT. I decided I would take a half a tab of acid and then smoke DMT on its peak to make sure I broke through.

Finally, the night came and I took a half tab of acid. I had two other people at home in case things went south but I decided to stay in my room put on some music and just stay there. I had a feeling it was going to be a heavy trip. Before the trip started I set my intention and I spoke out loud about what I wanted to achieve from the trip and I really wanted to stop all my substance use after this trip, I wanted to get all my answers and then move on with my life. I wanted to know the true nature of reality and I wanted to be done with asking questions all the time. I took half a tab of acid and waited for the come up. I was feeling good and had put on my favorite playlist and set up some lights in my room.

Once I reached the peak of my half a tab of acid, I decided that it was time for me to do the DMT. I filled up a good amount of DMT in the rig and took 3 long hits and held them in as long as possible. As I was taking the hit I could feel this pull and push inside my own body, like something was trying to escape and as soon as i exhaled, *there was a lamp* in my room and I saw it change into thousands of different lamps, this made me nervous and I decided to lay back down and I closed my eyes. As soon as I closed my eyes, my whole life flashed in front of my eyes, I saw myself fall through a tunnel of light and then back into a body. I didn't remember that I had taken a drug or that I was under any sort of an influence.

I woke up in a different life, everything seemed normal and I went about my day. I woke up every morning, brushed, showered and did all the things I was supposed to do. I made friends, I loved my family and I grew up. For some reason, some of the moments from this life seemed familiar when I was living through them, almost like deja vu. I didn't pay it much attention, it seemed, regular i guess? I remember that I got a job when I got older and I took care of my mum, i fell in love and I had similar interests to what I do right now. I don't remember all the little details of this life but I remember all the pivotal points. I remember finally dying one day and as soon as I died I fell through a light of tunnel and back into a body. I still didn't remember that I had taken a drug or was under the influence. I wasn't back to this reality still.

I woke up in another life, again. I did all the things I usually I do again and it felt uncomfortable, there was this sense that I had been through all of this before but how could I have? The time that I kept remembering hadn't happened yet, then how could I remember it? I brushed it off as just feeling off or being delusional. In particular I kept having remembering having a really bad shrooms trip when I hadn't ever actually taken shrooms my whole life. It seemed so confusing. Then one day I took shrooms, and it felt like the trip I kept remembering, I had just started living. It was horrifying. My cousin was there I kept telling him *""I don't understand.""* He said that I had taken some drugs and that I would be fine. I kept telling him I remember this had happened before and he brushed it off saying how could it have happened before? but I kept telling him that it has happened before and that I remember it very vividly. I was feeling very scared and like I was somewhere I shouldn't be and so I decided I would just go back to my room and lay in bed and wait for it to pass. It felt eery. As soon as I closed my eyes I fell back into another body.

I woke up in a moment I vividly remember. I remembered having woken up in this moment many times. Somewhere inside I knew what was coming and where I was but it was like my psyche was still actively trying to hide what I knew inside. I felt extremely sad when I was in this place. Then I went outside to the living room. There was a lamp there. Something about it seemed off. Almost like it wasn't following the laws of physics and it shouldn't even be able to look the way it did. I sat down on my couch looking at it and I felt very confused. I stared at it for a very long time. Then somebody came in the door. It was a woman. I remembered this woman. She came and sat beside me and it felt like my chest was about to explode. I started crying and she hugged me. She knew why I was crying. I felt so alone even though she held me so tight. I told her that I remember living this life before, she said she knew. She said she had to tell me something. I knew what she was gonna tell me and I just said ***""I know.""*** I was crying so hard when I said this. I kept remembering all the people I had loved and all the people I had wronged and it all felt so fake. I remembered it all but I felt extremely dissociated from it all. Then I looked at the lamp and i saw that it looked even more fake than it did before and somehow it started to grow wider and deeper and thats when it really hit me hard like a ton of bricks.

*It wasn't real. The lamp wasn't real. The couch wasn't real. The room wasn't real. The apartment wasn't even real. The woman wasn't real. My own body wasn't even real, none of it was real.*

I started to hear these noises coming out of everywhere. Weird loud noises and some really weird, almost disappointing music. It seemed like anguish. It sounded like pain. Like all the pain the world had been fit into one place. It also felt like I was there for eternity. Like I had always been there, like I never really leave there but just enter a slumber in order to forget this place. I was alone here. I had always been alone here. It was only me here. I cried and I cried for what felt like years. It felt like all my realities existed in derivative to this one. I felt sorry for myself. I knew that there wasn't really an escape out of this place. This was my mind and I was alone in it. I sat there accepting my fate of eternal exile and I apologized to myself for everything I had put myself through and I expressed regret for all my morally questionable decisions during all my lifetimes.

Then there came a point when I had completely surrendered to my situation and that's when the room started to fill with this enormous light that encompassed everything. I didn't have a form at this point, I was just pure awareness. the light that filled everything, I could see its but it wasn't quite human. It was formless but it felt feminine. It felt like she was holding me so tightly, giving me so much love and healing me of my scars. I started to ask her questions and she answered everything. I remember the last of our conversation being something like this, it wasn't in English but this is what we said.

***""I just want to know what true reality is. I can't do it anymore, I'm very tired.""***

***""space and time and life and death are just constructs that you yourself have created, in order to forget how lonely true reality is. You are alone here, it is all you. You have chosen to exile yourself in these questions and in these constructs in order to forget the true nature of your exile. Loneliness.""***

***""Then who are you?""***

***""I am also you. It is all you""***

As soon as she said this all her light and mine started to merge together and it all came flooding back to me, like an old memory sparked by a scent or a sound. I remembered having been there, I remembered always having been there. I remembered living all my lives. I remembered all the souls around me. All the people I ever loved and it gave me peace, a lot of peace. Everything around me was changing, it was beautiful and I felt at peace. Like the whole universe had been contained in my viewpoint. and then I was pulled into a tunnel of light and I fell back into a body. My body.

I was sobbing when I woke up and I remembered having taken the DMT and acid. I knew that I was back but it felt like I hadn't been here for years. That I had left and just turned off this consciousness and forgot all about it. That I had returned after years of journeying but somehow awoke after just minutes of actually passing out. It was like being born again. I felt thankful to be back and I went and hugged my friends afterwards and I called my mum, dad and my sister. I told them all that I loved them so much.

This was around a month and a half ago and I hadn't used any drugs or even smoked weed since then. Last week I decided to take a little hit at a social gathering off a blunt and I was instantly blasted back through many lifetimes and ended up in the DMT realm again. Although, this felt more like a flashback than actually living through all those lifetimes again and I instantly put down the blunt again. This let me know that I wasn't meant to be doing weed or any other drugs anymore and so I've decided to lead a sober lifestyle starting in 2019. I honestly don't think it will be too hard since taking a single hit off a blunt gave me so much anxiety and I don't even like to drink that much and I really don't think I'll be doing psychedelics again in this lifetime. Not because they're bad in any manner but because I have already taken more than what they had to give me. I think I will be fine now, I think life will be good. There is no cloud of questions over me anymore, there is only love. I hope that you all find what you are looking for also. Here's the link to that first ever DMT trip I took:

As you watch this happen, remember that the polarity is necessary, this allows everyone to make a very clear and right for themselves choice, those who resonate with fear will remain in lower frequencies and those who resonate with light with move to a higher density with the Earth. The polarity is aiding the process and you have control over most of your emotions, thoughts and certainly perceptions. Be watchful of them.

Don’t let the negativity get you down, it’s not there for you. You don’t need to accept and feel it as an integral part of your experience. It’s merely aiding in the path selection. 

Think of it as a giant flashy sign that says - “If you still feel a need for 3-D lessons and resonance, please proceed this way”. If you don’t feel the need, don’t let the energies into your energy fields, emotions and thoughts. Fear is an option.

The Japanese monkey, Macaca fuscata, had been observed in the wild for a period of over 30 years.

In 1952, on the island of Koshima, scientists were providing monkeys with sweet potatoes dropped in the sand. The monkeys liked the taste of the raw sweet potatoes, but they found the dirt unpleasant.

An 18-month-old female named Imo found she could solve the problem by washing the potatoes in a nearby stream. She taught this trick to her mother. Her playmates also learned this new way and they taught their mothers too.

This cultural innovation was gradually picked up by various monkeys before the eyes of the scientists.

Between 1952 and 1958 all the young monkeys learned to wash the sandy sweet potatoes to make them more palatable.

Only the adults who imitated their children learned this social improvement. Other adults kept eating the dirty sweet potatoes.

Then something startling took place. In the autumn of 1958, a certain number of Koshima monkeys were washing sweet potatoes -- the exact number is not known.

Let us suppose that when the sun rose one morning there were 99 monkeys on Koshima Island who had learned to wash their sweet potatoes.

Let's further suppose that later that morning, the hundredth monkey learned to wash potatoes.

THEN IT HAPPENED!

By that evening almost everyone in the tribe was washing sweet potatoes before eating them.

The added energy of this hundredth monkey somehow created an ideological breakthrough!

But notice.

A most surprising thing observed by these scientists was that the habit of washing sweet potatoes then jumped over the sea --

Colonies of monkeys on other islands and the mainland troop of monkeys at Takasakiyama began washing their sweet potatoes.

Thus, when a certain critical number achieves an awareness, this new awareness may be communicated from mind to mind.

Although the exact number may vary, this Hundredth Monkey Phenomenon means that when only a limited number of people know of a new way, it may remain the conscious property of these people.

But there is a point at which if only one more person tunes-in to a new awareness, a field is strengthened so that this awareness is picked up by almost everyone!

0,abahkg,45,51,"**TLDR: My sister who was raised with a rigid Christian worldview smoked weed, got extremely high, had a direct communication session with her higher self and other advanced beings, and learned the secrets of the universe.**

---

This story is a little long, but well worth it:

It's funny how things change. A couple years ago my sister would never think of partaking in alcohol or weed, and would look down upon anyone who did so. She was also raised in a Christian household with rigid beliefs, but she's always been more open minded than my parents or other sisters.

Recently my sister got her own apartment. She got some weed and smoked it. She told me that she got so high that she felt like she was floating out of her body, and she then had an extremely profound spiritual experience.

She described that a different version of herself started talking to her. This person told her ""Quick! Go get some paper and write this all down, I might not get the chance to talk to you again!"". This person described herself as my sister, but just a more enlightened version. A version further along the path of development.

Please note that my sister has never known any of this type of information. She had _no idea_ that this ""version of herself"" was called her higher self. When my sister was describing this to me, she was using terms like ""enlightened being"" because she had never heard of the concept of a higher self.

Not only did her higher self speak to her, but also a slightly lower version of that higher self chimed in. Some other beings that knew her also talked to her, and she said that even my dad's higher self was there.

They taught her a lot of things, like the following:

* Everyone is part of the Godhead. Everyone is part of the ONE.
* The reason for existence is to learn. Everything that happens is just the Creator experiencing itself. The point of all of this, is that the Creator wants to better know itself.
* Everyone on Earth has a choice to make, and if they do not choose a path during this lifetime, and they die, they will be ""lost"".
* There are various ""levels"" of enlightenment, and Earth is currently experiencing a ""step up"". Since she was at this certain level, she was restricted by time, but since the higher self was at a much higher level, the higher self is not restricted by time.
* There are negative forces that have been interfering with the world, and they are also trying to recruit people to their negative path.
* In time, there are an infinite amount of parallel realities stacked right next to each other, and as people make progress and make choices and advance in life, they switch to a new parallel reality.

My sister even asked them why she was able to communicate with them while high. They jokingly mentioned weed being the nectar of the gods, or something, but said that the true explanation was far too complicated to explain.

My sister had never heard of these concepts until now. This was new information to her. I sat in the car with her and was AMAZED that she was confirming all of the information given in [The Law of One](https://www.lawofone.info/).

I explained to her that this being that was talking to her was called her higher self. It is literally **HER** millions of years in the future, reaching back through time to attempt to assist her with her own spiritual development.

I explained to her The Law of One, and how we are all part of the One Infinite Creator. We are currently living at the time of harvest. If people do not use this lifetime to make a choice, and do not achieve either >50% service to others, or >95% service to self, and they die without making that choice, they will be ""lost"", as in they will have to repeat another 75,000 year 3rd density cycle.

I explained that those ""levels"" of enlightenment she was talking about, are called densities. Earth has been 3rd density for the past 75,000 years, but the cycle ended around 2012, and we are transitioning into the 4th density. I explained that her higher self, was of the 6th density.

I explained that every major religion has predicted this time in history. The Christians think of this as the ""end times"", and mistakenly call it the second coming of Jesus Christ. The Hindus have the Yuga Cycle. The Mayans knew that the 3rd density cycle of experience ended at 2012. My sister even told me that her entire life, she inexplicably felt absolutely certain that the ""end times"" of the Bible would happen before she got married. I even described to her that the book of Revelation described the harvest:

>“Thrust in Your sickle and reap, for the time has come for You to reap, for the harvest of the earth is ripe.” So He who sat on the cloud thrust in His sickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. (Revelation 14:15-16)

I explained that Hell isn't real, and God doesn't judge anyone. We have the free will to choose the path we want. We are even allowed to choose the negative path, even if it seems ignorant. The negative forces in this world are trying to polarize us negatively, and want us to be harvested to 4th density negative so that we join their forces.

As I told my sister all of these things, she was amazed and baffled, that I was using the same exact words that they used to describe these things to her. My sister's explanation of things was very scattered and confusing because she didn't have a firm understanding, but as I told her these things, she remembered more of her own experience and realized they were explaining these things using the same words I was using.

So to sum things up, my sister was raised with a Christian worldview, decided to smoke weed for fun, had a direct communication session with her higher self and other advanced beings, and they taught her the secrets of the universe. My sister's worldview was shattered, and she felt extremely overwhelmed by all this sudden knowledge given to her.

She didn't even realize that everything she was told, was also contained in The Law of One. She had no idea that thousands of other people have had these types of experiences on psychedelics.

I felt so honored to be able to share my knowledge with her. I felt extremely moved by this profound spiritual experience she had.

I can't stress how profound all of this is. Earth is literally going through its most important and significant time in all of history, and I've signed up to observe this and help with the transition. Thousands of people like my sister are waking up to the true nature of reality, and that is indescribably beautiful. 

The transition into 4th density is an unstoppable force of nature.

ECKHART TOLLE'S A NEW EARTH:

To awaken within the dream is our purpose now. When we are awake within the dream, the ego-created earth-drama comes to an end and a more benign and wondrous dream arises. This is the new earth.

They have no desire to get strongly involved in or change the world. If they have any ambitions, they usually don’t go beyond finding something to do that gives them a degree of independence. Some of them find it hard to fit into this world. Some are lucky enough to find a protective niche where they can lead a relatively sheltered life, a job that provides them with a regular income or a small business of their own. Some may feel drawn toward living in a spiritual community or monastery. Others may become dropouts and live on the margins of a society they feel they have little in common with. Some turn to drugs because they find living in this world too painful. Others eventually become healers or spiritual teachers, that is to say, teachers of Being. In past ages, they would probably have been called contemplatives.

There is no place for them, it seems, in our contemporary civilization. On the arising new earth, however, their role is just as vital as that of the creators, the doers, the reformers. Their function is to anchor the frequency of the new consciousness on this planet. I call them the frequency-holders. They are here to generate consciousness through the activities of daily life, through their interactions with others as well as through “just being.” In this way, they endow the seemingly insignificant with profound meaning. 

Their task is to bring spacious stillness into this world by being absolutely present in whatever they do. There is consciousness and therefore quality in what they do, even the simplest task. Their purpose is to do everything in a sacred manner. As each human being is an integral part of the collective human consciousness, they affect the world much more deeply than is visible on the surface of their lives.

0,aaxdor,17,34,"I had a dream last night of what many people have been calling _The Event_. The dream was so powerful, and so moving, that I feel like I need to share this information. It was just a dream, but it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever experienced in my entire life. Here is the dream:

---

It was a mundane day. I was in the car with my family, and we were driving somewhere. My sister and I were in the backseat. I saw something that looked like a strange aircraft, but brushed it off as probably nothing... We kept driving. Then I saw a strange blinking light in the sky, and my family agreed it was something unusual, but we kept driving and moved on... Finally a weird propeller plane flew very close to the ground right over us, and my sister is now WEIRDED out, and says ""OKAY, I saw that, WHAT IS GOING ON?!""

We drive a little further and I'm talking with my sister, and it's as if we are both experiencing reality from a different point of view. What I'm experiencing is not the same as what she is experiencing. We are trying to communicate with each other and reach each other, but something is in the way. Something strange is happening but we don't realize it...

All of a sudden I realize that my sister is TRYING TO TELL ME SOMETHING. Full of amazement and wonder, she says to me ""OH MY GOSH _AngelicGuidance_, I'M STARTING TO SEE YOU!!!""

What she means by this is that she was starting to see me at my pure soul level. It was like at that moment the _Veil_ was thinned, my personality and ego diminished, and she began seeing me for who I _really_ am as a soul/spirit, and not the exterior human being.

At that moment she began to recognize who I truly am, and I also began to recognize what I was, and who she was, and I was even remembering who I was.

At the same moment she said this, I suddenly felt pure unconditional love and total unadulterated bliss. This was _The Event_ taking place. Energy was hitting the Earth that was causing this. The energy was practically tangible. It was like returning to the natural order of things, as that way of being is sooo _good_ and people have forgotten what it's supposed to be like in the world. It was like coming to a knowledge of the truth and light, after having walked in the darkness for so long. It was a remembering of who you are, and how things are meant to be.

Everyone on Earth was experiencing this all together. I was overjoyed and was saying to everyone ""I love you, I love you so much!"" and I wasn't held back by fear in any way, or afraid of what they might think of me if I expressed my feelings.

I was in this warm state of love and bliss as I felt the beautiful energy radiate upon me. I was overjoyed and felt honored that my sister could finally see me for who I really am as a soul/spirit. She could see past the distortion of this exterior shell and ego.

---

The Event was sudden and surprising, but it was no problem to handle. There was no fear, and it was very natural and the most beautiful thing possible.

I strongly believe this dream was divinely inspired, and that _The Event_ is imminent, although I wouldn't be able to provide a time frame as I don't know.

I realize now that the transition into the 4th density is happening day by day, and NOTHING can stop what is coming. There will be an event that happens which will be undeniable. This event will not complete our transition into the 4th density, it is just one of many things to come. Obviously we cannot ascend into this heavenly new world without anybody ever realizing it.

If you asked someone ""what is the truth"" and they told you, you would have absolutely nothing to live for. This is what made me go insane when I tried to find the 'answer'.

We never want anything once we acquire it. A person could get their dream car, dream job, dream wife, dream everything, and they would still feel like they are missing something.

Since the beginning of time until now there have been people who have preached of ridding the world of evil and how the universe is based on ""love"". In actuality, nothing ever changes and they never feel the love they claim the universe has for them.  This is how it is supposed to be. If something gave you everything you wanted and was there for you when you needed them, you would never master yourself. You would never live with the possibility of obtaining godhood. On a micro level, it is no different than parents who always cook for their child, they die, and then the child has no clue how to cook for itself. When you don't have anyone to help you it forces you to become your own strength.***

&#x200B;

***In summary. God/Universe cannot intervene. Good people wait on God/Universe to intervene, and evil people are the only group that constantly takes action. Love never wins, it is based on false hope. The idea that love will win one day is what keeps everything going. That is why people with pure hearts experience so much depression and pain in their soul. They are longing for something that can never actually be. They are attached to an idea of something. This is how the concept of 'non attachment' came about. Evil always has to win because it gives you something to oppose, it gives your existence purpose. In the grand scheme of things that makes life one big story. An unwritten script. The only thing you can do at the end of the day is reject anything human and simply become an observer of this world, opposed to participating in it.

Here is a short description of this books contents:
“If you heard the Truth, would you believe it? Ancient civilizations. Hyperdimensional realities. DNA changes. Bible conspiracies. What are the realities? What is disinformation? 

The Secret History of The World and How To Get Out Alive is the definitive book of the real answers where Truth is more fantastic than fiction. Laura Knight-Jadczyk, wife of internationally known theoretical physicist, Arkadiusz Jadczyk, an expert in hyperdimensional physics, draws on science and mysticism to pierce the veil of reality. Due to the many threats on her life from agents and agencies known and unknown, Laura left the United States to live in France, where she is working closely with Patrick Rivière, student of Eugene Canseliet, the only disciple of the legendary alchemist Fulcanelli. 

To this day, Laura continues to undergo ad-hominem attacks on her web pages, her blog and even as faux book 'reviews' on book seller websites, by those threatened by the information she reveals in this definitive work.

Yet, with sparkling humour and wisdom, she picks up where Fulcanelli left off, sharing over thirty years of research to reveal, for the first time, The Great Work and the esoteric Science of the Ancients in terms accessible to scholar and layperson alike.”

I highly recommend this and see it is as required reading for any awakening individuals. 

Peace, clarity and love to you all Soul Fam!

0,aafz8h,44,54,"Yesterday I was looking for chakra related documentaries. I found one and from the beginning it felt like they were trying to sell me something. It was called ""Chakra Activation System"". Talking about how they developed their own system that works so well. Always leading like they were going to give advice and help, and then dodging it to talk more about their breakthrough. Surely enough, about 3/4 the way through they said I could get their product for X price. It wasn't a horrible price like some things like this I've seen, but out of reach to those in poverty definitely. And then they went into how you could use their system to manifest money. It left me feeling like it was manipulative and deceptive, appealing to desperate people to get them to spend money they don't have. 

I feel like if someone has genuinely made a critical breakthrough in spiritual knowledge, it should be available in some form freely given for the benefit of humanity... Trying to reach as many people as possible at the lowest cost possible. If I discovered something like what they claimed, my first response would be how can I share this with everyone. Not, ""How can I market this for my own financial gain?""

Don't get me wrong. I'm self employed, and I understand that people deserve to be compensated for their work. But surely there's ways to make it accessible? Like doing a ""Pay your own price"" thing, asking for donations, or a sliding scale. Or giving the information free and offering non essential services like readings or a study guide for compensation. How about like, a free pdf and then charge for a hardcover since those cost money to produce, or ask for donations to produce physical copies so they can be given to those without internet or computer access. Etc etc. 

I see this so often! To me it's become a red flag and I feel they probably have nothing of value to share. Just... How can you claim to be a lightworker or starseed or so spiritually advanced, and then keep such supposedly critical information from people behind a paywall? I could understand withholding things until people are ready, but there's plenty of spiritually advanced people who can't pay $50-400 for these things. Like, look at the Law of One or ACIM. You can read it free on the net, but have to buy the books. That's fair! Books cost money to make.

The one I keep going back to is the word ""game."" When you hunt animals, they're called ""game."" Lately, I keep thinking about how weird it is that you literally subsist on the bodies of other livings, be they plant or animal. I'm starting to wonder if life is a twisted ""game"" where you hunt ""game"" to live. 

I mentioned this in a comment once: When I was really little, like 4 or 5, I invented a game called ""animals eat animals,"" and forced my sister to play with me. My little plastic animals would chat with each other... and then devour each other. Even back then, I seemed to have an innate awareness of how twisted the game of life really is.

When I want to dig deeper into the meaning of words, I usually translate them to another language. ""Game"" in ""Latin"" is ""Ludum."" 

Well, ""Ludum"" also means ""school"" in Latin.

So basically, I think our reality is some kind of game or a school. It's a juEGO. ""Ego"" in latin is literally the word ""I."" I think we're supposed to learn to stop feeding off of each other (literally and energetically) and learn how to put others before the ""I."" But our entire society is built on the concept of me me ME and wanting more more **MORE.** Most people are just interested in having FUN and collecting FUNDS. 

Want to know the origin of the word ""fun?"" 

*late 17th century (denoting a trick or hoax): from obsolete fun ‘to cheat or hoax,’ dialect variant of late Middle English fon ‘make a fool of, be a fool,’ related to fon ‘a fool,’ of unknown origin.*

So perhaps we're all just fools who've been tricked into playing the game.

Anyway, if you got this far, thanks for reading my random ramblings. :D I went down a weird rabbit hole with this and wanted to share.

0,aa5yib,12,25,"A little background: I escaped a very toxic situation two years ago, a literal deus ex machina was the only way I could make a clean break (it is a long and difficult story to tell), but I was able to get away. Since then, a friend took me in and I've lived a very hermit-type life, it's felt like a cocoon, a gentle and low-stress living situation with no expectations of me except to work on healing, physically and mentally. However, that situation is drawing to a close (the house is being sold), and I am looking at a cross-country move that will reunite me with my family, and with some older friends.   

I have learned a great deal from the last decade of my life, and realized even during the worst of my situations that it was clearly karmic retribution, there were too many similarities - though it definitely was a case of getting it back three times worse. It did make me understand that I wasn't as good or pure a person as I could be, and I have worked very hard these last few years to become better. I've done a great deal of meditation, and focus every day on the three gates for my words and increasingly for my thoughts. I absolutely still slip up. I still deal with snap anger and berate myself if I find I'm taking my emotions and insecurities out on others. I am in no way perfect. 

I don't feel ready to leave my cocoon, but life has dictated otherwise. I am terrified to backslide into my old defense mechanisms. I've lived my whole life as though I were unafraid of change, but I always, always am so full of fear and anxiety when I dwell on the major upheavals to come. 

Rationally, I know it'll be ok, and if I could survive the dark years without pulling the trigger I held to my head multiple times, and the universe seemed to intervene to save me from it - these are things that should increase my confidence in my own adaptability. But even through meditations or walks, I can't shake the anxious pit in my stomach. I am scared.

The quantum perspective sees the body as interdependent and interconnected energy fields which are woven into an intricate web of feedback communication loops.  Eastern medicine has the body defined as an elaborate array of energy pathways. It corrects the message, not the messenger. 

This is more in tune with how the body actually works. 

The mind and body are entangled much as matter and energy are entangled. The seventeenth century philosopher René Descartes chose to dismiss the influence of the mind on the body because he couldn’t identify the nature of the mind. Traditional medicine embraced Descartes’ separation of mind and body from the beginning of its existence and still continues to do it today. 

*The power of the mind is far more effective that the drugs which we have been programmed to 
believe we need.*

The trouble is, **it’s the subconscious mind that is in control; it’s much more powerful than the conscious mind**.   Healing occurs when positive imaging combines with a feeling. 

The subconscious mind can be reprogrammed or it can be tricked. 
The subconscious mind represents our beliefs, which are relatively fixed. 
The conscious mind, on the other hand, is fluid and adaptive and is self-aware.
It can observe and evaluate any programmed behavior we are engaging in and change the program

Every medical student knows the power of the “placebo effect”. 

People get better when they believe they are getting the best medicine. It is a testament to the healing effect of the subconscious mind. 

The history of modern medicine is largely the history of the placebo effect. 

This placebo effect has been demonstrated in all drug trials to be a significant if not annoying 
problem. It has been discovered that drug companies are actively studying patients who respond to placebo effects with goal of eliminating as many of them as possible from clinical trials. 

**They can’t get their drugs approved if that can’t prove that their drug is significantly better than a placebo.**

In 2002, it was discovered that most of the clinical trials of the six leading antidepressants failed to show significance over placebo. In double blind studies of these drugs, there were impressive healing effects demonstrated with both placebo and active drugs that could even be demonstrated on functional MRIscanning. 

People who had responded to the treatment after suffered with depression most of their lives, were shocked to find out that they weren’t actually taking anything. 

Incidentally this information was not easily come by. 

It was only discovered through a freedom of information request after the FDA refused to release it. 

It did change the way data was reported though. 

Now, drug trials that are accepted for publication must have been registered prior to their start 
so that data which is contrary to the desired outcome doesn’t get “lost”.  Nothing gets published without all of the results being available for study. 

A rather famous, if not embarrassing, consequence of the placebo effect was demonstrated for a 
common surgical procedure.  A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, told of an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Bruce Moseley, who was trying to figure out how knee surgery helped his osteoarthritis patients. 

He already “knew” it worked; he just wasn’t sure which part of the procedure provided the greatest effect.  The standard procedure, which is used throughout the world, is to flush the debris out the knee and to shave the damaged cartilage.

 So he divided his patients into three groups. One group would get the shave, the second would get the irrigation and the third would get a fake surgery that was indistinguishable from the real thing by either the operating room personnel or the patient. 

He even made the three incisions, did some fake probing, splashed some water, and generally 
acted like he was doing the procedure. 

All the patients had identical appearing wounds on their legs. 

The results were both clear and shocking; the placebo group was improved as much as the others and with a shorter recovery time.  His conclusions were summarized; 

     “My skills as a surgeon had no benefit on these patients. The entire benefit of surgery for osteoarthritis of the knee is the placebo effect.” 

This study was even televised on the Discovery Health Channel and showed the placebo group doing things that they couldn’t do before the surgery like playing basketball and walking without a cane. 

Their knees had clearly improved and it wasn’t just in their heads. 

**Their minds changed reality**

Polarity:  there is the “nocebo” effect; the power of negative beliefs. It is just as powerful as the 
placebo effect but causes sickness and death.

 The statement, *“You have six months to live*” has a powerful, self-fulfilling effect on people when given by a trusted clinician. 

**...In the end, it doesn’t matter what you believe; either way, you’re right.**   *Your biology adapts to your beliefs.*  Seeing a soul trapped in a paradigm is the most gut wrenching sense of hopelessness.

[You create your own world.](http://truthsilence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/manifest-anything-2.jpeg)

You are the master of your own fate. 

Illness may manifest in the body, but it is not of the body.  **It is of the mind.**

Once a paradigm is created it is extremely difficult to change it. 

*We literally create our whole world around our paradigms.*

 It isn’t just the problem of dogmatic thinking either, powerful financial incentives reinforce it. 

You are rewarded for “right thinking” and punished for “wrong thinking” through monetary rewards and disincentives. 

But who is the master and who is the slave?

So back in october Im listening to a meditation about kundalini hypnosis no big deal I think. I began shaking all over my bed uncontrolably. The following week this continues during random waking hours and every night trying to sleep. I was now afraid to go to bed. My assumption was I couldnt go to a doctor as they wouldnt understand something spiritual and feared being put on psych meds. So I go to have reiki done and she talks to me a lot about how I need to balance my chakras and stay grounded and not fight it. Things turn around and I start putting out a lot of Love into the universe. Well with karma and such I run into a girl and we imiediately felt a deep soul connection. I couldnt beilieve it, this was the happiest ive ever felt in my life. The thing was she was in an open relationship but didnt want to leave. This was hard for me to completely understand but I accepted it and we both talked about how this was different, special and unconditional Love. We texted a lot and then one night Im over there we have a minor diagreement and then out of nowhere she cuts off all contact and still wont call/txt nothing. We even talked about how we were definately twin flames and such. Why/ how could a person who felt so connected to you just drop contact? Anyway its so hard to even explain what that relationship is like. I experienced so much pain in this life which is what brought me closer to God in the first place but I feel like im meant for something more and I dont even know where to start.

0,aa3ha1,16,9,"The answer to this question has been given differently by channellers and through people under hypnotic regression and, of course, there are scientific theories as well.  


I find myself questioning information mainly from some well known channelers v.s. a client in a Dolores Cannon book I've started reading because there seems to be a big discrepancy so I'm wondering what your thoughts are.

The channelers that I've come to trust and resonate with say that our Moon is an artificial satellite that was constructed and brought in by star people.  I know Aluna Ash has said this but I'm pretty sure Kryon has as well.  I can't remember if Bashar has and I want to say Adronis has said this but also not sure.  In Dolores Cannon's book ""Keepers of the Garden"" she has a client that answers that the Moon was formed by a cataclysm with the Earth which broke off pieces and then reformed into our Moon.  This is the common theory amongst scientists as well and the one I believed to be true for a long time.  

I know that it's possible that information that comes through channeled messages and through people under hypnosis can be influenced by different factors which give the information it's own ""flavor"" but the facts usually always fit pretty nicely no matter who's giving the information.  In fact, it always continues to surprise me especially when I read or listen to information coming from skeptics and people who just don't even believe in a lot of what comes through in their hypnosis session for example.  


So anyways, I'm wondering if anyone else has more input on the whole Moon origin thing or have their own insights to the discrepancy?  It was only the one client who said this v.s. a handful of others that go with the satellite version so it's not yet enough for me to just throw in the towel on channeling and hypnosis.   It's just bothering me.    


EDIT:  I have some info that someone just shared with me over in /r/Reincarnation and I thought share it as a possible answer to my question...

*""Many groups become fascinated with transient information of a specific, mundane nature and have their information polluted by negative entities who gradually replace the positive entities that began their contact. Pursuing information of this kind is like moving the dial on your radio so that you end up with another station altogether from the one with which you began. This change in desire for the kind of information that the group seeks from its contact is the signal to that contact that what it has to offer is no longer desired, and the Law of Free Will requires that only hints of this de-tuning process be given to the group so that all choices that the group makes are totally a product of its free will. When a group continues to seek the transient information, the positive contact gives hints here and there that such information is not of importance, but when the group persists in seeking this kind of information, the positive contact, in order to observe the free will of the group, must slowly withdraw and is then eventually replaced by a negative contact which is only too happy to give this kind of information, but with less desire for accuracy and with maximal desire to remove the group from the ranks of those who serve others. When the group has been discredited by false information—such as dates of future disasters which are publicized by the group and then do not occur—then the negative entities have been successful in removing the power of the group’s light and have gathered it for themselves.""*",new,What is the origin of our Moon?,9

My wife is 31 weeks 5 days pregnant and has preeclampsia (please send her some good healing energy, we would appreciate this more than you know).

When dealing with friends/family/associates or especially meeting new people I try my best to allow my abilities to do what they do naturally, have a clear and open mind to see things better and assess the situation appropriately as a healer. But lately everything blows into my mind as if I’m perceiving everything about them before I actually know much, like a gestalt. 

It seems like my gut has obtained this amazing ability to sense people’s intentions, even their personality and traits and take in their energy to assess what further action should be taken. Visuals/images also pass into my brain of these individuals as the classic psychic stereotype portrays. Overall my abilities feel as though they’ve been heightened x100, my very being/spirit has ‘leveled up’ in a sense. Everything feels upgraded, refined, improved, etc and I’m wondering if this has either to do with my becoming a father or something else.

0,a9zwis,39,42,"Greetings soulnexus,
I would like to explore healing abilities, lately I've had a lot of guidance towards that, I've never really healed in an important way before  
  
I believe I have access to latent healing abilities through vision, I would like to try this out if I may  
  
It would consist of anyone who feels called to this, to send me a message with a description of an area in their life they want to improve or struggle with, I believe the deeper the emotions shared the deeper I can connect. 
  
 With that message , a recent picture of your face(taken the day of sending the message if possible,not obligatory) , I will of course respect privacy and not send that picture to anyone else  
  
What I will do is read the message, connect to your desires and struggles, then simply meditate on your ""face"" so to speak, by simply watching your face, it is the most direct way to connect to your being, as I am viewing it through my vibrational lens, I share my perspective, and more importantly I share positive perspective which can be of use for your being to release more energy  

When I look at a picture of a person, all kind of energetic symbols form on the skin, most often green-colored, the space of the picture changes to become as if the person is right in front of me, the more I watch to put it the more divinity I can see in that person, I can only see more divinity if I'm looking at a person in a a positive light, perceiving their life through their eyes in a positive way, it is really something which is why I make this thread to lovingly investigate and play with this ""ability"" which may help healing

This is a fun experiment for those willing, we can keep each other updated

Edit: a better description would be a co-evolution, as I see you I connect to your path and I look at it, its like sharing my perspective on itwith you directly, its not as much a sending of energy, through open and willing sharing of perspectives we both create more energy, this is not an exchange nor a sending, it is co-creation, abundance and infinity are the values of the healing energies I connect with",new,"Offering healing, trying to see if I can effectively heal from distance",42

I met this girl who caused (without even trying ) complete and total wake up mode. I quit smoking cigs, stopped with my vape, haven't had a soda or a Xanax in over a month and a half. I'm walking now, very health conscious. Lost some weight too! A pretty good bit. I feel good and love myself, something I've never been able to do. 

It's very hard for us to talk for long periods of time as both of us start feeling this intense feeling we can't explain, and neither of us understand what this feeling is. It's nothing like we've ever felt before. I feel like I know her so well that it's scary. She can sense my energy some too. She can apparently tell when I get anxious. We just got off the phone not too long ago, a little over two hours! I learned a lot but some of it I already felt somehow and already knew. We're both feeling this same push/pull feeling, and we got separate tarot card readings and mine pertained to my lifestyle change and hers referred to a situation she's afraid to acknowledge but she's going to have to soon because it won't go away and it's going to get bigger and heavier.

This is a story I've told before, only its been hiding in a video innocently-labelled [*My Desert Adventure: the Untold Bit*](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrisolivertimes/comments/6ewzp9/my_desert_adventure_the_untold_bit/).  I waited months before even talking about it and I'm not entirely sure why.  I guess part of me was hoping such an encounter would happen again.  (I'd certainly be better prepared with questions if it did.) 

This story involves my housemate, someone I dearly love, who we'll call (the manliest name I know,) *Spartacus*.  It was the day I made it home from the desert, the same day I made this account, and these things happened roughly an hour after my ""mother"" had gone. 

Spartacus was in the shower when the switch occurred.  I know this because I had gone in to tell him something that had just come to me.  The revelations had started coming thru; I was eager to share and modesty isn't something that still exists between the old man and me.

When I walked up to the shower, the look on Spartacus' face was one of disbelief: like he couldn't believe he was actually there.  Seeing me startled him but not enough to erase the amazement from his face of simply being there.  I've long-forgotten what I said to him then but his expression was enough that it wasn't what I went in to say.

We talked again after he had finished his shower and dressed, looking more comfortable with being there.  We were in his bedroom when I realized something was *off* about his face.  *Hey Spartacus*, I said to him, *your nose is a little too far to the left.*

""Oh, is it?""  He reacted as casually as he would had I mentioned a bit of stray toothpaste.  He then walked into the bathroom and *fixed it*.  When he came out again, his nose was where it was supposed to be.  *Yeah, that's better.*  My words didn't ask it but my tone and *stare* certainly did: *who the fuck (and what the fuck) are you?*

I walked into the kitchen and, after a few minutes, he did too.  ""I'm going out for milk and bread."" he said.

*Yeah, you do that.* I replied.  He got in his truck and drove off and  I was grateful that he did.  I had just watched the woman I'd known my entire life [fail to answer a simple ""yes"" when asked ""Are you my biological mother?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/chrisolivertimes/comments/8cums2/a_tale_of_six_demons_and_my_mother_part_2_of_2/) only to storm out when I wouldn't stop repeating the question.

(I'd be remiss if I didn't mention my *water into wine* moment as this is the point in my story that it happened.  I was alone for the first time since escaping the desert and a cup of coffee sounded all kinds of amazing.  Spartacus had made a pot of flavored coffee that morning which is an abomination of a beverage.  ""So turn it into real coffee."" my intuition screamed.

I closed my eyes and wrapped my hands around the coffeepot.  I remember thinking about the rich smell and taste of real coffee when I felt the *shift*, felt the energy of potential flowing from my will down through my hands and into the reality I inhabited.  My consciousness had slipped into satori state and I had done it: I had turned the flavored abomination into my favorite drink.  Realizing I'd succeeded, I giggled like a madman.  *There is no spoon.*)

I heard the truck return, so I met my housemate at the door, opening it before he had a chance to come inside.  There he was, groceries in hand, when I asked the question that would change everything.  ""Are you the man I know as Spartacus?""

*No.* he simply replied.  There was no sarcasm in his answer.  He seemed stunned that I could tell.

""Well, I guess you better come in so we can talk.""  I took the groceries from him and was putting them away as he went into his bedroom and sat in his bed.  It's where Spartacus spends most of his time, I guess Not-Spartacus felt it was where he should be too.  I joined him there.

I don't recall how the conversation started.  Even in hindsight I couldn't tell you how such an encounter could happen let alone begin.  I certainly wasn't prepared, how could I be?  I think I broke the ice by asking if he was Spartacus again.

*I found you in the desert.* he eventually said to me.  I was skeptical as not even the rescue helicopters had managed to find me there.  *I found you there, I knocked you out, and I raped you.*  For the first time, Not-Spartacus looked ashamed.

""You knocked me out?  It was you that finally let me sleep?""  I had been awake for a solid week prior to the rest I had out there, naked under the desert moon.  It was a part of what led to the insanity that sent me out there.

*I did.  I knocked you out and raped you.  I'm sorry but you were just too beautiful out there.*  I certainly wasn't attacked while I was out there, didn't see another soul until I made it back to the highway the next day, but I already understood that the usual causality of physicality didn't apply here.

""Want to know one way I can tell you're not Spartacus?"" I whispered to him.  *How can you tell?* he mockingly-whispered back.  ""Because if I whispered quietly like this, he wouldn't hear a single word I said.""  Not-Spartacus looked a little taken aback at how clever that was.  I was meant to notice his nose being 'off' earlier but not improvise my own techniques.

And then his phone rang.  

""That's them."" said Not-Spartacus.  I glanced at the screen and all the caller ID said was *RESTRICTED*.  Partially out of habitual politeness and partially out of a need to process what'd just happened, I excused myself as he took the call.  ""*Yes, he's here.*"" was the only thing I heard him say and the last I'd ever hear from him at all.  

When I looked in his room again, Spartacus was again the man I knew.  Slightly-puzzled as to why I was asking if he was himself, at least he said ""Yes.""

# Aftermath

It's been two years, four months since this occured.  I haven't (knowingly) seen Not-Spartacus again but the experience has certainly answered some questions while raising others.   Where did Spartacus go when Not-Spartacus was here?  How many times have I dealt with someone who wasn't who they appeared to be?  At the very least, it was a final blow to my misconceptions of the objectivity of this reality.

I've had to tell Spartacus this story a half-dozen times.  I don't know if he's willfully-forgetting it or if something external is removing it from his memory but he never remembers any of it when I bring it up.  He remembers me coming home, he remembers my ""mother"" being here, but he has no recollection at all of going to store or of any missing time.  His memory is generally-poor but it's a story about an inhuman entity replacing him (*forfucksake!*), I'd expect that one to stick.

As far as ""being raped"" goes: I don't believe it.  I didn't then and I don't now.  Our secret enemy in this reality is phenomenal at one thing: *lying*.  Not-Spartacus revealed himself to me willingly and *intentionally-so.*  There's no reason to believe anything he had to say.",new,The Time An Entity Replaced My Housemate and Apologised for Raping Me,10

“Greetings. We are the Arcturian Council. We are pleased to connect with all of you.
We have awakened within you a sense of belonging, and that is a very good thing because you do belong to a galactic family. And you need to know that you are not alone in the galaxy, but you also need to know that you have roots in this galaxy. You may at times seem like the new ones, the new souls, because you have chosen to incarnate on Earth. You chose a bigger memory wipe for yourselves when you did so.
Other beings on other planets in other star systems know their galactic history, whereas humanity has experienced itself in somewhat of a quarantine. You’ve been shielded from the truth by choice because you wanted to give yourselves the experience of isolation.

But now that we and others like us have awakened within you the knowing that you are part of a bigger galactic family, you can rest assured that you are going to feel more and more comfortable with the presence of extra-terrestrials in planet Earth. They are already there of course, but they are just not out in the open about it.

Now, the other piece here in knowing your roots is about recognizing that you have been playing this game for a very long time. You already have been highly evolved beings in other parts of the galaxy, and you don’t have anything to learn as you move forward. You just need to remember, and we are here to help remind that you have already been Pleiadian. You have already been Sirian. You have already been Arcturian, and you have already been a higher dimensional being. Therefore, there is nothing flawed about you. There is nothing young about any of you either.

You have connections to other beings all across this galaxy, and when you do reunite with your brothers and sisters who are members of your soul family, so much of who you have been will come flooding back into your consciousness, and that will be a great re-awakening.

We are the Arcturian Council, and we have enjoyed connecting with you.”",new,The Great Re-Awakening ∞ The 9th Dimensional Arcturian Council,31

I hope you are having a wonderful day, though I am sure you do! In the next few months, I am starting a program to help people with depression, traumas, anxiety etc. and will be doing quite intense work on myself at the same time. One of the things I will be doing is a certain ""exercise"" that opens up an ability I recently acquired in which I can see with my eyes 100% shut. It doesn't matter if I close my eyes, put a blackout patch on them, a blindfold, even if my normal eyes cannot see I can see my surroundings, though in a different resolution, in real time.  

So far I tested the ability using fingers, having someone put a certain amount of fingers in front of me while I am blinded and then I say out loud how much I see. This is, on a personal level, all I needed to know to confirm it is true, but I know many skeptics out there will say I was told prior what the amount was and this is just a memory skill, others will say I have a fake blindfold or something that lets me see through it, etc. I know how skeptics react, as I once was one. 
I am looking for creative ideas to demonstrate the fact I can see with *another sense.* I will then do a live event in which I have local people assisting live, and the whole thing will be diffused live on both Youtube and Facebook. I want to make this as widespread as possible. It's an idea that's been throtting in my mind for some time, and now I am ready to do it. It takes quite a lot of preperation work to get there, but once I am in the zone I know that what I can do will show people that there is more. And I will of course explain *why* I am able to see, as the preperation includes an intense focus on the third eye point.

0,a9f4wy,19,10,"After my spiritual awakening last spring I got a lot of synchronicity with Pleiadians and Starseeds. So I looked them up and realized a series I’m making has a lot of Pleiadian looking characters. I already knew at that point that my higher self was implanting spiritual symbolism and facts into my series, so this had me excited for reasons I couldn’t understand

The word Pleiadian just seems so highlighted to me compared to every other word when ever I see it. Just thinking about how I must have chose to come here from that race gives me electricity from my head down to my toes of excitement

I did a Starseed channeling with a coach and saw what seemed to be a Pleiadian planet, and my Pleiadian mother who was extremely tall. On that planet I was a blonde girl, even though right now I’m a guy. I asked her why she was so tall and she just playfully said “I’m a big deal”

In video games I always would pick blonde or white haired girls for some reason too. And when I spoke to my healer about it he (correctly) pointed out that it doesn’t matter. He said The Pleiadians are real, and I might be one. But I shouldn’t get lost in that aspect of myself alone because there is so much for me to discover in so many areas

I was honest and told him I REALLY want to be one, and he said I should be proud of my honesty

So did my guardian just appear to me as a Pleiadian because that would be a familiar and comfortable for me? I know I am in fact a lightworker. But I still have this Pleiadian itch, a need to be one

And please do not bother writing “what about Antarctica, the entrance is down there?” Yada yada. Look, neither one of us knows; I **do** know though, and I don’t expect you to believe me now, because thats foolish. You, reading this right now, **know** that you **think** you **feel** the heavy, solid truth that I’m speaking right now, because I’m **telling the truth**

No, I don’t have the money yet, *but I will when I said I would*

No, I don’t know for sure that we’ll find it, *but someone has to try, and I stand the best chance out of anyone I’ve met so far*

So, it’s my duty to do this. 

If you don’t believe that above everything else, is the truth, you are not welcome. We are going to find the truth. 

I’ll disclose this now, frankly because I’m gung-ho, and I want to mix things up since I’m clearly being heavily monitored in regards to this topic. 

*I am looking for a language*

A language

Siberia, the extreme north of Canada, and the North Pole. Those are the candidates for this ancient language’s location. I have learned the “key” to this language, most of it, so I can read it. All I/we (i have no way of knowing if this will be just me or everyone) have to do is learn it all and form an audible version of it, if one is not provided. This language will heal, it will heal diseases, my friends. It will exorcize Demons when spoken, it will transmit energy and knowledge, it will empower each soul to **remember**

The Truth. 

I’m 26 years old. I’m a scholar, a teacher, an inventor, an artist, a leader, a  lover of sports and warfare and strategy. 

I’m white. I’m a man. None of that matters anymore. I’m a soldier. I very well could suffer consequences for even mentioning the language, it’s the part I wanted to withhold until we met, but I’m telling you all now, those who are watching, that the “Ancestor Language” is  **the key**

Only 15 people have been officially included so far. Most of you, the hundreds of you who’ve messaged me, have for one reason or the other not been given a serious thought. This is 75% due to the content within your initiatory communications. 25% is because my other project for funds was stalled in December, but we’re already gearing up for January. I’ve been a busy bee. Oh, and I got banned from r/conspiracy right after coming out with my plan. Who woulda thought? Some of you who subscribe there post this there so that those late arrivals to this idea I’m trying to manifest can have some context. 

I will be funding the entire expedition myself, the basics at least. Any entertainment will be discouraged but certainly remains your own responsibility. We will train in Autumn-Winter 2019-2020, either in Texas or Michigan. Maybe both. It will be, way easier than boot camp, in a way, way harder. We need our bodies to be refined shape, our immune systems and mental facilities checked *beforehand*. No MK Ultra assassins, witches, spies, or saboteurs will be able to infiltrate this group project/mission. I’m not going to sit here and give you my credentials publicly, and anyone who thinks I would do such a thing given what I claim to be doing is too immature and unobservant for this cause. 

For instance, if you come seeming to be looking for adventure *solely*, you will automatically be left without a response. If you are suspect, say you are a scientist or a military veteran, you will be given more attention, but you’ll be asked to explain exponentially more about your life up to this point and when training begins you will be given more attention, and we will watch you much more clearly than a hiker from California or a fisherman from Alaska. I feel this is only fair and those of you who prove to be genuine will be trusted fully and given important jobs. 

If I fall, one shall take my place. The Creator will not allow the darkness and the false light to continue their fakery and their abuse of humanity and Earth infinitely. This will end *one day* but frankly I don’t want it to right now, not if it doesn’t have to. I wanna see my nephews grow up, and I wanna try to fall in love again, and I want to go to Japan. Etc. But more than all of that times a million **i want to do the next right thing**

I’m in the shadows, I’m making moves, be sure of that, Dennis. Be sure of that, CIA. Be sure of that, witches. Your abominations are coming to an end. I’ve already said in public, to have the record out there, if you surrender to us, we will be merciful with punishment, we will work this out, we will rehabilitate you. The dark ones lie to even the highest human cult leader, or sorcerer. They need to be, within reason and with caution, offered **a way out** themselves in order for us to pull off what I’m hoping to pull off; actual justice and peace. Brought by virtue. 

The Ancestor Language will force them to see that. **All things will be made new... even the devil himself**

If I happen to die or disappear and don’t come up for air in the coming months, I pray that one of you pick up the torch, find the Ancestor Language. They haven’t stopped me yet, and I’ll make this claim, believe it or not; **they can’t**

Found this late last night, and had quite a few ""hmmm interesting thought"" moments. I obviously do not agree with all the statements this person made.

So I want to start a discussion on this, lets break out our critical thinking caps and our discernment capes... I want your thoughts and opinions on this. How do we feel out how ""woo"" is too woo...? We live and were born into a world of illusions. If this is the case, how do we know and discern what is ""Real"" and what isn't? Are we being lead around by the nose? Or are we onto something but like with everything in this realm, there are many false leads?",new,Critical Thinking,17
0,a94vbc,49,55,"I feel like, I was instructed to come here. Like, most spirits don't even know Earth exists at all, and the ones that do know it's a total fucking shitshow. Coming here though is like a shortcut, the ""crash course"" so to speak through a program. So like, coming to Earth and beating it is like a first grader skipping middle school and high school and going right to PhD. Also, i feel like the only reason i'm here is because I have to choose between this world and another (the one I came from). This is one of absolute free choice and chaos, and the other is pure love but total safety. That feeling of ""You have to go there so you can choose which one you want....forever'. Does this resonate with anyone else?",new,Doesn't anyone else remember being sent here?,55

0,a92xcp,16,22,"The Event is not a singular incident but a composite system comprised of various co-incidents. The Event can be decomposed into a linear (in relative timeline) series of physical events that have and will continue to take place. These individual events are themselves a consequence caused by a series of nonlinear (in relative timeline) actions taken (or not taken, lack of action is an act). The questions of ""If?"" and ""When?"" are unimportant, as The Event IS happening NOW, with unstoppable momentum. Questions that are worth our energies are ""Who?"" and ""How many?""

Who is the most important person in the world? The person that nobody gives a fuck about, relatively speaking. Its a literal numbers game, with the real power in the hands of those who know and who are unknown. The ones everyone knows and has heard about, are the ones who havent a clue, havent a shred of real power.

How many (important persons) are there? ""Blessed are those who are (materially) poor in spirit, for theirs (spirit) is the kingdom of heaven""

WHO ARE YOU? HOW MANY ARE YOU?

WHO COULD YOU BE? HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU LISTENED TO YOU?

WHO DO YOU WANT TO BE? HOW MANY TRIES BECOME SUCCESS?

From now on there is no try, do or do not. Staring into the face of failure these days? Simple, go look in the mirror instead. Make yourself multifaceted, make yourself fluid, make yourself a higher standard, make yourself the center and circumference. Make yourself while it's still yours to make. Make a choice before you become a choice.

At the end of 2015 i had a profound experience, i did not share it with many. I have an urge now to connect with others who going through similar experiences. Before I had my loving experience i’ve gone through terrible anxiety and panic attacks for just over one year, I would have several panic attacks a day, was sleep deprived and lost lots of weight. A few times I saw my spirit guides at night. standing near me as I opened my eyes, and once a very horrendous creature disformed but with incredible beautiful colors. My mother came over to help at the end of 2015 and I developed great anger towards her, then one day I was able to let go and realized that all she wanted is to be loved, other things were happening during those days, I realized that I was one with everything and everyone, I was all that is, I understood everything, there is a greatest plan behind everything, there was no right and no wrong, there was nothing to forgive to anyone, all was good as it was, there was greatest compassion for everyone, but also I did not need to change anyone or help anyone for everything was according to plan and everyone was on the path where they needed to be. I felt almost weightless like a heavy chain fell off me, there was joy and greatest love towards God who was permeating all that is with his energy and love, all was God and yet God was beyond everything! I started seeing extremely many number synchronicities, 20 or more during each day, shapes like upside down triangle or upright triangle, infinity sign, was hearing communication via songs and towards the end of the experience a faint glowing light around human beings, some had blockages so light would not shine everywhere, some had more light. I told my husband about what I felt, I said there was no right and wrong and he disagreed with me, then my logical mind jumped in and I remember starting to get lost in doubt, next thing that happened was a man educating me how to pronounce some word better because he did not understood what I said and I felt very hurt, from there on the experience vanished, leaving me with knowledge, number synchronicities and from time to time music/song messages.
I’ve been seeking to be in this love state for several years now, I am able to somehow practice oneness by treating all the surrounding with love and kindness like I would treat myself, but I stumble when someone hurts me, I notice that I separate and close off, I don’t know how to deal with negativity ... I understand that I need to be compassionate but i can’t bring it into practice :(. Is there any advice how to get over the negativity of others?

Thank you! And Merry Christmas everyone.",new,Overwhelming love and Oneness with all that is! Help.,6

Now on a personal level also would also say the 7 Chakra Orgone EMF Protection Healing Chakra Stone Orgone Pendant Protection is coming from India.  Didn't know that when ordering.  Realized no way arrive by Christmas.  So even with first class mail shipping out on the 18/19/20 it seems as if they're all landing Monday in one giant logistical push.  Anyhow.

What better way to spread protection than spread stones across the world.  First we have mailed seeds around the world.  Now we are mailing stone pendants and charged bracelets.

There's no hidden meaning besides my own balance of ego and sending into the wind of four corners our elements.

All of you help me on this journey and trust me when I say I look forward everyday to read you.  Every day look excited at the journey..""Try it this way!""

0,a8zn0y,13,6,"I need some love and support from this beautiful community.

This physical time-space reality into which we are focused is so overwhelming.

I came into modern spirituality from a militantly-Christian-borderline-insane-homeschooling-mother environment. I have made progress on the journey of forgiveness relative to my past, but I know I still have a long way to go. I still have a lot of resentment, chips on my shoulder against my mother (and, less directly, my father) and against Christianity and Christian believers, with the exception only of those Christians who are far more open-minded and more authentically ""loving"" than others are.

Today I felt, for some reason, a pull to poke around on Christianity-related subreddits and just read some of the posts and comments there, and I'm so hella depressed now because of all the stuff I see here. Mothers selling their teenage sons' computers against their will because they were caught looking at porn, fathers telling their kids they'll go to hell for being gay, etc. And reading this stuff is really just the straw that broke the camel's back. Other things are depressing me too, other aspects of this physical ""reality"" that are causing very real-feeling pain for some people. Some of it is other people's stuff, like driving home today and seeing a horrible-looking wreck out on the freeway right near my house, where there was evidently a critically-injured or even dead person lying on the ground and one person comforting another while they looked on in extreme distress. Some of it is my own -- I have secrets that very few people know, and bigger secrets that nobody knows. Secrets that make me feel like such a piece of scum, secrets that I blame largely on my upbringing. And I feel like such a goddamn **phony**. I'm keenly aware right now of how much inauthenticity is present in a lot of my ""IRL"" relationships (family, in-person friends, etc.). Listened to a Teal Swan clip today (currently my #1 favorite teacher other than Myself) about what she calls ""Overlay,"" which is a layer of phoniness and ""pretend playing"" that we build up through which to filter the world around us in order to cope with it. And it hit way fucking close to home.

And the spiritually-evolving part of me is like ""It's all ultimately our choice. We're here having these painful adventures because we chose to. Everything is as it should be."" And part of me is like ""Fuck this shit, how am I supposed to fake a smile in a world like this?"" Serious ""holiday blues,"" to say the least. Can anyone offer any encouraging words, or even just commiseration/solidarity?

I love you all very much. Namaste.",new,I'm feeling so overwhelmed,6

I did catch an overview of the recent events, I must be careful with being compassionate, life is not as simple as being compassionate to everything all the time, if you are compassionate without limits all the time like a default setting, you are not chosing to be compassionate anymore, you are sleeping in a sense, chosing the easiest way to function, even to those of us who follow love there will always be a time when we must chose to not be compassionate and be more guarded/protective, it is in these moments that we know and affirm our compassion, being able to say no allows us to say yes,  saying yes to everything is the same as saying no to everything, it is sleeping

So the fact that a community member had to help displace an abusive mod is a sign that of this overly compassionate effect, the mods which overview this sub should have noticed this and acted immediately, this community is like a sanctuary  
The times of friendships/relations/connection/group thinking above everything are over, while in a sense even it has roots in love, we can not tolerate any negative/destructive behaviour from our friends, be that people in our communities, whom we are in close ties with  
Immediate action to stop the offensive party, and keep clear and clean your space, the other can always stop and learn from their ways but that is not a priority

I’ve long thought this was the case. Why, if the ancients believed Saturn was a “sun” or “star” that had died, would NASA choose to withhold that information, given the evidence to support such an idea? Why did they all worship Saturn? Also known as El, Baal, Cronos, Odin, Quetzalcoatl, even Yahweh? Why? 

What’s special about the ringed planet? It’s known as Malkuth in the tree of life, representing the physical world. Why is Saturn at the bottom of the tree? The X is associated with Saturn, as is the hexagon and hexagram, because of the storm at its North Pole, which forms a perfect hexagon. The cube can be formed by this basic pattern in nature, that is **omnipresent** on Earth in our plants, our very molecules.

In 710 A.D., the Khazarians lived in the land-locked area between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea near the Caucasus Mountains.  *They practiced a form of idol worship but converted, as a matter of convenience, (as a group) to Judaism.*   They are the descendants of the Babylonians of ancient Sumeria.

They are the present-day **Ashkenazi Jews,** are Caucasian and speak **Yiddish**.  Their sacred teachings are the Talmud.  The historical Jew was African and spoke Hebrew. His sacred teaching was the Torah.

World War II Germany was the only remaining country in Europe providing them total freedom.  They were condemned as usurers, swindlers, desecrators, infidels and heretics. '

In order to have a sovereign territory from which to finance both sides, **Switzerland** was declared forever neutral.

A strategy was developed to influence the most intelligent through these four methods:

1. **Use money, sex and institutionalization of chemical dependency** of men in high places,
2. **Cultivate students** with exceptional ability for special training in internationalism,
3. Use those trapped influential people as agents and place them behind the scenes of all governments as **experts** and **specialists** in science, religions and cultures,  and -
4. Obtain absolute control of all **mass communication** to make the masses believe that a one-world government is the only solution to the world’s problems.

Earlier in the year, I had two release dose Bufo/5-MeO-DMT experiences with a Mexican facilitator, and I had a smaller vaped 5-MeO freebase experience more recently that was less strong than my toad experiences but still spectacular. One night over this weekend, I had a powerful and intense 5-MeO reactivation, my most powerful yet. It was very much akin to being back in the experience for real, it was very powerful, if brief. I was staying in a cottage for the weekend on the stunning west coast of Scotland in the countryside with two good friends for a weekend of walking in nature. I had smoked a little cannabis with them before retiring and hadn't slept much the night before, which may have played a part in my reactivation, as my mind was highly active on going to sleep and I had a hunch that something may kick off.

The next day, we all ate a good dose of dried *Psilocybe cyanescens* mushrooms (from the same batch I had microdosed with on the day of my first release dose Bufo experience). I usually vibe very well with mushrooms, and these particular mushrooms I've found to be consistently very clean and serene from past experiences with them. The coming up period was unusually anxiety ridden, and despite being out in stunning nature with two of my best friends, I was introspective and having a turbulent time, mentally. A big part of this experience was my forced mental focus on my recent Bufo/5-MeO experiences...being in the bemushroomed state allowed me to much better experientially conceptualise actually being in the 5-MeO state, in a way that is simply not possible when sober. And my mind was being bombarded with the power and profundity of my past experiences, but in retrospect it seems that some much needed integration was occurring.

I now, in reflection, sincerely believe I experienced absolute pure, boundless infinity/eternity during my experiences (for whatever reason I can recall more of my second Bufo experience, it took that for me to ""get the message""), and I will hold this view for the rest of my days. From my perspective, when the 5-MeO annihilated my ego, I was no longer aware of myself as a finite individual...in fact this seemed like an illusion. With my individual self gone, I appeared to wake up to the fact of my being an infinite being, and rather than being an individual being, it's more that I'm an individual facet of something much, much greater than me. If you think about it, 13.7 billion years ago, the Big Bang occurred, and the physical universe and all its matter and energy and physical laws came into existence. We humans are special in that we are able in some way to comprehend our place in the universe...""we are star stuff...a way for the universe to know itself"" to quote the great Carl Sagan. But of course we are very much part of that universe, there is no, and can be no separation. All the large atoms in our bodies were forged in the cores of long dead stars. Our bodies run on energy originally derived from plants that can convert star light energy into matter we can consume. So on some level, our egos, our perception of being an individual being, separate from everything else, is a very sophisticated and elaborate illusion concocted by our brains. It makes great evolutionary sense of course, for us to feel we are separate entities, so we are able to live our lives and pass on our genes. So our egos are essential for our survival. But it is worth bearing in mind, that sense of us being separate individuals is an illusion. These breakthrough 5-MeO-DMT experiences very powerfully took down my ego. And when this occurred, I lost awareness of linear time, of being finite, and being an individual being, instead feeling a very powerful state of universal oneness, of unity with the infinite and eternal All That Is. This was a very cosmic experience, far beyond me as a human. But this force of infinity/eternity I very deeply encountered...felt like it could be part of the same force that ignited this universe/the multiverse in the first place, some kind of ultimate universal self organising fractal blueprint or equation of creation of which I/everyone/everything is a part of. It really is all one! To intellectually understand or appreciate this...and to know it, through direct experience...are two different things. But this was a very humbling and also empowering experience. In other words, experiencing this force directly, really felt like experiencing what some may term as God/Source/Brahman/Universal Consciousness.

Of all the many psychedelic and altered state experiences I've ever had in my life, of which there has been many, no experience has come remotely anywhere near as close as affecting me as deeply as this. I never ever expected to be able to experience something so incredible and so utterly mysterious in my life, and I believe I now know what a fair chunk of the mystics, yogis and near death experiencers were/are on about. ""Entheogen"" is not a term I’ve ever used, it never seemed really appropriate and so I never felt comfortable using it, being an agnostic man of science. In my experience though, out of all the psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT seems truly worthy of such a label. Of all the various states of consciousness I’ve experienced over my lifetime, this is one I would have no issues referring to as intrinsically sacred. Without experiencing this directly myself, I simply would NOT consider such an experience to be remotely possible for a human being to experience by ingesting a chemical, or through any means for that matter. If there is a more reliable way of experiencing death in some measure before one's time, I'd like to know of it. This stuff has a power that dwarfs that of any other psychedelics, IMO. I don’t say this stuff lightly either. I’m both a seasoned and well-travelled psychonaut and a scientist and someone who likes to think they are rational and grounded person.

So yeah, the TL;DR version is that I'm truly awed and humbled, and it goes to show 5-MeO keeps working on you long after your last session! This is an experience of immense power, that takes one to the very outer limits of their humanity, so it makes sense it takes a while for one to process and integrate such an experience. I would rate this collective experience as the most profound and amazing of my life to date. I intend to keep up a daily meditation practice now as I feel this will better allow me to retain these insights and build on them as I move into the future.",new,Personal reflections on 5-MeO-DMT,7

0,a7t03b,8,14,"I posted this in r/occult and someone suggest I post it here too. Any advice is appreciated!

I’m new to this subject and would love some interpretation of what’s been happening to me this year.

About mid year I started getting really interested in dimensions, not alternate, but ones that lay on top of our universe that the human eye can’t interpret.

I was at a weekend away with my friend’s bridal party and everyone else was asleep. I closed my eyes, not yet asleep, and saw a phosphene vision of myself walking past. When I talked to people about it they said they thought I was astral projecting.

Later in the month, I was up late doing some schoolwork (I believe it was the 2 AM hour) and I started to fall asleep. Growing up I would sometimes hear a voice calling out my name when falling asleep, but this time I heard a full sentence (unfortunately I don’t remember it now). I woke up, but quickly drifted back to sleep and this time I heard in a deep voice “I am a zero” and then couldn’t get the image of an octopus out of my head. 

I convinced myself I was possessed by an octopus demon. During that time I was obsessed with double reflections in mirrors and windows and would daze out looking at them, so I tried to limit my time in front of them (I’ve never been able to sleep with a mirror in my room).

Some while later I did acid for the first time. I saw what I call an inter-dimensional snake, it was smiling at me and was rainbow colored. I threw up three times on that trip, the last of which I saw my toilet covered in blood for a split second. After that it felt like the octopus demon was gone and I was back to being myself.

But, I started having regular phosphene visions, faces of animals (my grandmother loved lions, and I still tend to see them a lot), a women (I think she might be my spirit guide or higher self), along with outlines of rooms and faces. These persist to this day, I can pretty much see things anytime I close my eyes, and sometimes without closing them.

I started getting interested in the subject, trying to figure out what was happening. I watched a YouTube video about being psychic and the whole rooms energy changed. I saw a face low in my doorway, but it disappeared when I got a call.

I had some paranormal experiences growing up. I saw a ghost in my house when I was a child, an old man sleeping in bed next to me. But, my Mom didn’t tell me until about ten years later that an old man died in the house. I also would hear footsteps upstairs when no one was home and voices that sounded like when phone lines used to get crossed or a low radio, super muffled, but somewhat clear. But, I hadn’t experienced any of those things in a long time.

That night I had a dream that a life size geisha doll was standing in the corner of my room. I was laying in bed talking to my boyfriend and for some reason we thought nothing of it being there. At the end of the dream the geisha doll climbed onto my bed and strangled me. I realized it was a dream and took deep breaths trying to get my boyfriend to wake up next to me, but ended up waking myself up from it. I know it sounds like sleep paralysis, but that’s the only time it’s happened to me, and as soon as I opened my eyes, I could move.

Since then thoughts have been popping into my head that relate to nothing, but make sense later. I randomly thought about jury duty, a couple days later, I’m called to jury duty. I sing a song that’s NEVER on the radio and it plays in the car when I get off work. And something that’s been happening far before these experiences, I think about someone while I’m at work and they walk in a few minutes later. 

More recently I’ve just been having consistent phosphene visions and I hear high pitched noises all the time. Also, I’m very sensitive to energy shifts. Sometimes it just feels like the room has completely changed even though I’m the only person around. It just feels louder all of a sudden but it’s not auditory.

Anyway, I know this is a lot, but I needed to get it all out. If these are natural abilities I’d love some advice on how to start strengthening them. Thanks for reading this long ass post!",new,Advice for 2018 Awakening,14

How do you handle spiritual frauds?  I'm specifically referring to people who use spirituality as a crux/branding tool for their ego.  I feel like society has woken up to the fraudulent/hypocritical Christians who act holier than thou but don't practice what they preach, but I've seen patterns of similar hypocrisy among \~new age\~ types that seem to go unchecked.  

As an example, a *former* associate of mine (I dare not call this demon a friend) used to be into pretty heavy, dark occult stuff in which she would intentionally try to harm those around her for her own sick pleasure using energy work.  Now, she's all over instagram pretending to be some sort of enlightened healer, complete with captions about \~self love\~, yoga, healing, etc.  I understand that people can heal and change, but for as long as I have known her, this is her typical m.o. of pretending to be more knowledgeable than thou to service her ego.

Logos.  **Logos is the ability to communicate without using the letter I.  (Take with grain of figurative)**

&#x200B;

It is the ability to communicate with reason and logic, with an audience, convey the points and still reveal points about the spirit behind the words without investing in self or in other selves.

Slowly.  It comes, slowly.  Nearly every post starts with ""I"" or ""I'm""  or ""I am"" or within first sentence has word ""I""  - AND THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT!    Just, that is not LOGOs.  Again, ""There is nothing wrong with communicating with saying ""*I'm trying to tell you, there's nothing wrong with that.  I do it all the time.""  Practice makes perfect.*

&#x200B;

LOGOs  is very simply *COMMUNICATING REASON WITHOUT SELF /  COMMUNICATING KNOWLEDGE WITH EGO*  polarity that - honestly - don't know how that manifests on the Spiritual and Mental planes,

I was fighting with some sort of mentor or friend in this dream (possibly a spirit guide?) that I don't recognize in this lifetime. He was helping me learn how to harness the power of Excalibur (the sword from the legend of King Arthur in case you haven't heard of it). I don't have many flying dreams but in this dream, I was flying around chasing bad guys/entities/other worldly beings that meant harm to the Earth and I was trying to vanquish them with Excalibur. 



My mentor's demonstration of using Excalibur was powerful. The sword was engulfed in a purple flame which was what gave the sword it's vanquishing powers. Otherwise, I could stab and slice these bad guys all day long and they wouldn't die were it not for the flame. 



So now it's my turn. I take the sword and there's still some purple flame life in it but eventually I will have to charge it with my own purple flame. For a while I'm feeling fucking badass flying through the air and chasing the bad guys and watching them disappear as I stab them or slice them. Then the flame starts to fade and my attempts to protect the Earth from baddies starts failing. My mentor yells from somewhere nearby that I need to activate it myself. Although I feel powerful and able to face the bad guys they're definitely not as afraid of me anymore since the flame died. So as I'm speeding through the air chasing another entity I focus on some sort of incantation in another language to help activate the purple flame. It works! I'm in business and although my flame isn't quite as strong as my mentors (which I'm pretty disappointed about) I can still vanquish bad guys running for their lives. Then I wake up.



The last time I had a dream of a wielding a flaming sword was on January 1st while riding a red dragon. I pointed it to the Earth and activated some sort of spring to well up. Before this year I've never had dreams of dragons (OR flaming swords) and now they're showing up in full force!   I'm so very curious to know if anyone else has had any dragon dreams this year?  Or any dreams that seem meaningful to them?

My hypothesis is that they are the higher self wanting to get in contact about a past or future event.

Most panic attacks are for no obvious particular reason but they can usually be traced back to trauma.

Mine were linked to synchronicity and in my case they could have only been caused by one of two things.

Either I was being spiritually attacked or my higher self wanted to warn me of something.

They began when I went through a stage of sleep paralysis.

As I meditated and focused on the present moment and relieved stress they only became more frequent.

It turned out I was completely ignoring meaningful coincidences that on self reflection lead me back to the traumatic event.

This is why I am not a big fan of mindfulness anymore but believe self inquiry is also an important practice to learn.

Throughout history philosophers have practiced self reflection to work out the patterns and meaning to their lives but in todays world its usually not done practiced properly by the average person and seen as anxiety and rather than pointing out patterns of behaviour the person is encouraged to focus on the present and ignore patterns.",new,Random panic attacks,9

I feel my heart has burst open,

I now reveal it in this rhyme.



A flood of pure cosmic love, is pouring out from inside.

It had been locked away deep... 

Swallowed over with pride.



Because when looking back into my history past.

I realized I was wounded...

My heart had been slashed!



But I have silently forgiven those who had hurt me.

Because they were only broken as well...

This truth I now see.



In this powerful process I have healed myself.

And realized that the blame...

Should fall on no one else.



For love is the purest form in this dance of reality.

So to attach the vibration,

Of hate, rage or jealousy...



Is to deny yourself of its magic forever.

It is better to remember the feeling,

That had brought you together.



And let not the dark shadows block it from the light.

For love is a songbird,

In the window of life...



Dare you cage it? So you can keep it lifelong.

And risk end the magic,

In the little birds song?



If you have to ask me, Dare I say NO, let it fly free!

For when it returns to your window,

Again you'll be gifted its sweet melody.



So...

Here I now stand... as free as that bird.

And if you don't believe me...

Then hear out my words.



For I peeled back my layers...to start fresh and new

And in finding myself.

I have also found you...



Girl...

I see you when your outta sight!

And I feel the rhythms,

To which our hearts beat tonight.



Your distant voice in the morning before I open my eyes.

Makes me wonder...How long has it been?

How much time has gone by?



For now I know, we have been here before...

And this is just but a reunion,

Of our twin flames once more!



Girl...

This IS the greatest story ever told... 

For we ARE written in the stars of old.



And surely too in the sands on mars.

From our two souls dancing on lands afar.



Because our love is eternal, across all of time and infinite space.

And when I gaze into your eyes,

Upon that familiar face...



I still have to imagine... just how far will we go?

And that's when I realize... 

I don't have to ask... 

Because I already know...

So I find myself in a neighborhood at the top of a hill looking at the sun rising in the east over a lake near where I live. I have a hard time looking straight at it at first because, you know...the sun. But, after a while I can look right at it and I make a mental note that it's more yellow than the white sun that we seem to have these days and I'm marveling at it's beauty. When all of a sudden, another sun forms over the lake and looks sort of like a huge egg yolk. Either that or a huge orangey yellow beach ball...I can't seem to make up my mind as it switches back and forth. This sun seems much more tangible and like I can reach out and touch if I were close enough. The rising sequence of the suns happens a few times in this dreams as if I'm being shown something I need to remember. The first time I watch the first sun (the real sun in the sky) rise like normal and the egg yolk sun is rising in sync with it. Until it falters and crashes down and lands in the street and breaks open (at this point it's more of a capsule). I rush to it with a bunch other astounded people and see that it has a whole bunch of random things that felt out when it broke. They all belong to people who have just passed away and I get the feeling like they need to come claim them soon. Then the sequence starts again.



The suns start rising again and this time the egg yolk/beach ball sun makes it high into the sky with the real sun. But as soon as it starts setting it gains speed and starts falling and leaving a trail of red smoke behind it. It crashes again into the Earth and, again, it's broken and things belonging to the dead fall out of it and I examine them. I remember thinking that this was confirmation that I won't be dying...I'm not dead since I'm here looking at these things.

Being unconscious, and being made from nothing, we live according to how we feel. So we aren’t aware of how what we say or do effects other people.

Growing up we need to learn that feelings and emotions matter. So we cant say or do this or else it will hurt another. As a child, new to this world, we just naturally listen to our elders. Because 1.) theyre older so they should know more and it seems to be right, or 2.) they use their intimidation because they do know more than we do, and 3.) we need guidance as this is new territory for us.

In turn, this can destroy your child within. Telling you that you can’t have this or can’t have this. Can’t do this or can’t do that. Can’t say this or can’t say that. But what if we feel like it because we see something others do not.

0,a68lk0,8,19,"Emotions, feelings...they matter. The issue with these two are that they can get in the way of truth. They can blind you  of something that you don’t want to change because it’s different.

The truth of that matter is that, we need to put emotions aside in order to glean truth about a situation. I do not care if it’s something you’ve done everyday for the past 10 years, something that you’ve come to do because it a part of your routine. It does not matter if these people or things are important to you because they have helped you in a time of need so you felt that you needed them.

The truth of the matter is I don’t give a fuck about your emotions if it is blinding you from an obvious truth. Sometimes we need to man up and grab our balls and change things that we know need to be changed. Sometimes we need to tell other people to fuck off if they are trying to invade our world with their perspectives.

I’ve been using spirituality to contain this anger that I hold within. And now I know that this anger is something I needed to fully accept in order for me to come to be who I need to be and want to be. This anger within is not because of things that need to be worked out on myself.

This anger is my driving force to get people to wake the fuck up to who they are so we can come together and change the cycle this world is caught in. 

As a spiritual sub, we focus too much on the love and light. And while this is what we need in this world, we also need the courage to stand up to the people who continue to force their views on the world and us as individuals.

You need to break off from everything that is controlling your energy. This is a time where we must have faith that the higher powers are giving us the hand to break out of this cycle.. that they are there waiting patiently to come into your full awareness.

We need a major decluttering in the system, and we need people that will expose what it is that needs to be thrown out. Now, we don’t need to do this on a huge scale unless that is what you are called for.

I did try to connect with my twin in the higher realms through meditation when I first started reading about twin flames, but my intuition sucks so I didn't feel anything.

The other day, something happened that made me believe that I wouldn't have a soulmate or wouldn't get married to someone I felt excited by. I started rejecting the idea of a lasting romantic partner, and now I feel this intimate energy around me, but it's unwelcome due to my rejection. It's like if someone's trying hug you to comfort you but you're upset with them so you don't want them to hug you. It's not aggressive at all, just unpleasant for me because I'm metaphorically trying to shut my door while this energy is trying to be sweet and hand me flowers, so to speak. From what I've read about twin flames, I'm wondering if this could be my twin's higher self trying to let me know that they are, in fact, here and that our relationship will be fulfilling?

I feel like it could be a mental illness thing instead though, like depersonalisation or PTSD / sensory overload due to my history of trauma.

So yeah, can you feel your twin flame's energy like this if you haven't met in the 3D? If so, does this mean they exist in the 3D right now or is it possible that they haven't manifested in this lifetime but are still reaching out this way. The energy feels very intimate and almost physical.

What does this sound like to you guys? Twin Flame or a flaring up of mental health issues?

Far in a past time, lost in the space time,

the Children of Light looked down on the world.

Seeing the children of men in their bondage,bound by the force that came from beyond.

Knew they that only by freedom from bondagecould man ever rise from the Earth to the Sun.

Down they descended and created bodies,taking the semblance of men as their own.

The Masters of everything said after their forming:

Builded they then the Halls of Amenti,that they might dwell eternally there,living with life to eternity's end.

Touch him not ever with the power of night.Call not his flame to the darkness of night.

Know him, and see him,one of our brothers,lifted from darkness into the Light.

Release thou his flame from its bondage,free let it flame through the darkness of night.""

Raised then the hand of the figure,forth came a flame that grew clear and bright.Rolled back swiftly the curtain of darkness,unveiled the Hall from the darkness of night.

Then grew in the great space before me,flame after flame, from the veil of the night.

Uncounted millions leaped they before me,some flaming forth as flowers of fire.

Others there were that shed a dim radiance,flowing but faintly from out of the night.

Some there were that faded swiftly;others that grew from a small spark of light.Each surrounded by its dim veil of darkness,yet flaming with light that could never be quenched.Coming and going like fireflies in springtime,filled they with space with Light and with Life.

Then spoke a voice, mighty and solemn, saying:""These are lights that are souls among men,growing and fading, existing forever,changing yet living, through death into life.

When they have bloomed into flower,reached the zenith of growth in their life,swiftly then send I my veil of darkness,shrouding and changing to new forms of life.

Steadily upward throughout the ages, growing,expanding into yet another flame,lighting the darkness with yet greater power,quenched yet unquenched by the veil of the night.

So grows the soul of man ever upward,quenched yet unquenched by the darkness of night.

I, Death, come, and yet I remain not,for life eternal exists in the ALL;only an obstacle, I in the pathway,quick to be conquered by the infinite light.

Awaken, O flame that burns ever inward,flame forth and conquer the veil of the night.""

Then in the midst of the flamesin the darkness grew there one thatdrove forth the night, flaming, expanding,ever brighter, until at last was nothing but Light.

Spoke HE then with words of great power saying:

Then spoke I:

*let me be a teacher of men,*

*leading then onward and upward until they,too, are lights among men;*

Dwelt I again among children of men,

teaching and showing some of my wisdom;

Sun of the Light, a fire among men.

Now again I tread the path downward,seeking the light in the darkness of night.

Hold ye and keep ye, preserve my record,

guide shall it be to the children of men.

0,a6al25,31,28,"I want to share a little bit (or more) about what I have been going through.

I was raised a Christian by a very overprotective mother who taught me to be completely dependent on her. I loved her immensely, but she passed away five years ago from cancer, and my sister two years ago.

This fucked me up. When mum died I went full Christian in hopes that I could see her in heaven. By the time my sister died, I fully rejected the notion of God. I became a walking husk, my only source of happiness from codeine pills which I took religiously for years.
By the end of last year I was suicidal and laying in bed almost 24/7, waking up and praying for death.

At this point I had what I call a very profound spiritual experience. I interpreted this experience as my “self” not really being this jaded and sick person I believed I was. It was intense- laying down and feeling as if my chest was being ripped apart and the pain immediately transformed into pure ecstasy. This lasted for about six hours and was more intense than any drug trip I had.

Since then, I have been trying to make sense of what happened to me.
I have explained what has happened to various people who I felt may be open to it, and said it sounds like “ego death” (there was never a point in the experience where I felt like I was dying) and “kundalini” awakening among other things. I am choosing not to label anything.

Over the past year, many symptoms have occurred. How I describe them is how I am interpreting it and may not actually be like this at all, but I will try and describe what has happened...

Before my experience I was hearing ringing noises and high pitched frequencies, and immediately fell into emotional pits of despair after hearing the frequencies, each time, several hours after.

After the experience this despair feeling became almost all the time, but it was much easier to endure with the faith that had come with how convincing the experience was.

At the start of this year the high pitched noises stopped and I felt a very sharp pain in my left ear. Describing this is very hard, as I can’t look literally inside my head and I have formed various images based on how it felt.

It was sort of like I could focus my attention on the pain, and the pain would lead into other “spots” of pain. By gently placing my attention on the pain and trying to relax into it. By relaxing into it the pain would become extremely intense in that could-be physical location and there would be a climax of pain where I would hear a wet cracking sound in my ear and suddenly the pain is gone and I could move onto the “next spot”. This happened hundreds of times, sometimes several times a day, each “spot” slowly getting further and further down my throat and even into my belly.

About two months after this started happening I would spontaneously start moving my neck around, hearing multiple cracks each time. There is more to this but I am not confident in describing it. It was almost like it started with smaller head turns, until my neck would stretch and the pain would become intense again similar to the spots that I would focus on, and once again climaxing and my neck would be able to relax into a more comfortable position each time.

The best way I can describe what this all started to feel like by this point is as if my body was taken over by tension. As if when my mum and sister died I started tensing really hard to keep the pain down, and coupled with my opiate addiction this hyper tense strain became my normal everyday state and I didn’t even know it was happening until this process started to occur.

Around June this year I noticed as these points started to go deeper that my tummy was almost always sucked in. Really really sucked in, all the time. I started to have blissful moments where my tummy would relax and I would feel warmth through my body as if I were relaxing into a hot spa. My tummy would make groaning noises and stop contracting.

Through all of this my mental state has fluctuated immensely. I am much, much better now. But I still have no idea what the f*ck is going on. I don’t know who “I” am and I’m constantly trying to think my way out of everything.

The more this happens and the more pain I seem to release from my body by allowing this to happen, the less dominant my thoughts become. You can think of my life up until this point being a train going 120mph with broken brakes. Oftentimes I feel like Tobey McGuire from the second Spider-Man film where he tries to stop the moving train, because otherwise my thoughts are hell bent on trying to “solve the puzzle” of what this all means and who I really am. After 14 months of ruminating about it all, I just want to stop thinking about it.

Also, there seems to be a constant struggle for my body to either be in a state of tension or relaxation. When doing anything, I usually have to remind myself to stop tensing, and it becomes really clear suddenly how tense I am and I can relax everything. It usually builds back up within a few minutes though making it a vicious cycle and I rarely get to think about or focus on anything else. If I could say one thing is a major drawback it’s the compulsion to focus on this all like it’s something that needs to be fixed, I literally can’t focus for long on anything else other than this predicament and it’s been that way for about 18 months. Something /is/ happening but I have no idea what. Compared to 18 months ago I am *so much* more relaxed, *so much* more in touch with myself... but still just as clueless, and just as worried about what is going on.

Anyway, that was a mouthful. I’d like to hear if anyone else has had similar experiences. Where I’m at now my tummy is almost fully deflated and not sucked in at all, I have dealt with almost all of those “pain spots” in my head and it feels almost predominantly like it is in my throat and belly now. Physically I feel a lot of strain around my vocal box and the back of my head feels very numb compared to the rest of it. I am constantly flashing back to my childhood and every day reliving feelings that I completely forgot existed. 

EDIT: Around Christmas time I fell into a deep despair and woke up feeling much more in tune with everything. I am still struggling but no longer experiencing the same degree of hopelessness and potentially delusional thoughts.",new,Can anyone help me figure out what is happening to me?,28

M: Did I ever tell you what my aunt said about you?

F: I don't think u shared it

M: The first time she saw you, she that said she knew you because you prayed for her. Remember?

F: Not exactly 😬 but I'm listening ... 

M: The other day when I said I visited with you and your fiancee, she said she wanted to see you again. I offered to show her a picture but she declined saying she wanted to see you in person.

M: I explained that you lived far so she probably wouldn't be able to see you anytime soon. She said that she always thought you would look different but when she saw you, all she saw was an angel

M: Now, she told me that had never told me these things because she knew I didn't believe in the power of prayer

M: Today I had her meet my traumatic brain injured patient because she's visiting, using my car, and they are like polar opposites for the cause of their injuries and I always wanted them to talk. His injuries we're caused by not wearing a seat belt and he blames himself almost everyday. Her injuries were caused by her seatbelt which improperly fit her small frame

M: I told him and his dad about how in her coma, angels brought her prayers and that she was able to identify you without me even knowing you did because I hadn't told you about her accident

M: She then said yes because when the angels came closer, I could see their faces. Naturally, I was surprised so I double checked that it wasn't just your face because of your prayers. She said you brought her other people's prayers too. 

M: How do you suppose that could happen?

Find the music that aligns to you, focus on your breath as the vibrations flow through your consciousness, and induce those trance states that let you communicate to whatever it is you wish to reach to.

0,a5u9nc,0,5,"I hate doing laundry. It's so boooooring, ya know? But then when I'm actually in the moment, everything slows down if you let it. Your stress will be gone for a short amount of time. I guess the same can be said for anything that isn't captivating you in a negative way. You'll be able to talk yourself through what you're doing. Talk to yourself as you do it. You'll learn a lot because you will be focused on what you are doing and not your fast thoughts that are zooming in and out. Someone very special to me taught me that. 

""Talk to yourself?""

Yes. To yourself. Out loud if you want to!

""But people might think I'm crazy.""

They may think you're crazy, but in actuality, it's quite the opposite. So many of us are closed up inside because of the everyday struggles of home life. Or maybe it's that thing in the back of your head saying, ""yeah, you know it's me. We're gonna have to communicate at some point because I don't like it here. It's too dark and I'm ready to get it over with."" What's crazy IS the outside. The inside you can tame because that's YOU. But you can't control what happens on the outside. You just have to wait patiently for Divine intervention and trust that there are spirit guides and angels following you everywhere making sure you're okay and get to where the universe wants you to be. 

We suppress so many things at one time, so many things that we want to DESPERATELY work out in our favor, but it ends up blowing up in our faces because why? Why did that happen? Because you aren't taking care of the most important thing in your life: you. Didn't get the job promotion? It's not your fault. 

""But someone else got it and I deserved it! I'm better qualified, have more degrees and went to school!""

Education is TREMENDOUSLY important, but not quite as important as self care. With self care, you gain experience. Experience is mandatory for you to gain knowledge. Without self care, you can't do any of these things anyway and it will never work out, and your life will never make sense. It'll be a jagged edge that will never stop squiggling around no matter how hard your try to make it a perfect line. A pointless list of things that we call ""material happiness"" will only give you problems on top of problems. 

Look, this is the point. I don't believe life came this far just for it to stop here. This is a new beginning. You are being reborn. Wait and let the universe and its love mend you and rise you up like a Star dust Phoenix and surrounding you will be a pool of a lifetime of joy. Just surrender. Don't let fear stop you, you stop fear. YOU. Stop fear. Stop fighting what isn't meant to be. You should not get in your head and focus on the future. The future doesn't matter right now! If it did, we'd already be there. You cannot expect a gift of change for your future if you do nothing about it and haven't even opened the present. Self care is soooo important. It took me 25 years to figure that out. Luckily, the universe has a funny way of issuing what I now like to call ""soul stamps."" 

So picture this: it's like getting a stamp card at the festival in town for games and the like. Once you get so many stamps, you can cash it in for a prize. Right? So we have to make sure we're prepared for our prize following before what I'll call our ""grand prize."" After all, if we don't... we'll continue to live in an uneducated and monotonous society. 

Thank you all who read this far. My soul reaches out to you with positive vibes and I hope maybe it helped in some way. 🌟💛

This world is in the need of people who can say “fuck you” to the system we currently live in. We need people who can risk looking like fools to the world in order for us to bring what it is we wish for earth to be in harmony. We need people dedicated to help bring man out of this viscous cycle that the world has fallen into.

My vision is that of the one that does not like to see us suffer. And while I know some of us are here to just enjoy the experience, I feel like the call for those who really want to lead the way, or are called to lead the way, will come at you stronger this year.

And it does not have to be to some large scale that you do this. Simply putting more of your energy into helping others raise their consciousness/awareness is a push that we need to make. Do what it is you can, do not give up all of your energy. Know your limits. Just complimenting others or talking to others in a spiritual connection. Just please, express your truths and the opportunities will keep coming, not always how you expect them to also.

Most importantly is to take care of yourself. Make sure you’re not sacrificing your energy to things that do not allow your soul to be. Do not go into things because of security instead of doing what it is you really wanna do with your life. If that is where you go, by all means. We all run to our own clocks,  but it would be nice if all can be on board on making it a mission to wake all who want to just be.

0,a5lc5h,6,3," So I am having this problem, where I am finding it extremely difficult to move forward or stick to anything. I am extremely undisciplined; more than ever before and I think that it is tied to an event that occured during the Summer. I escape my reality using weed, cigarettes, alcohol and videogames/series. I had my shit together duing the holidays; intermittent fasting, almost  no alcohol, cigarettes or weed. Exercising every day, meditating for 40+ minutes  every day. It was going well. I had no idea that I would attempt suicide just a couple of days after I really felt like a King. 

Not long after this period, I went to a festival and after coming back, had an acid trip,  during which I kicked one of my best friends out of my house. The reason why was that everything that he said felt like it was an insult towards me; like he was trying to rile me up and I felt absolutely terrible about who and what I was. I felt immense guilt, shame, self hatred, but on a conscious level, I had no clue as to why this was happening. I tried to figure it out and just couldn't. So I got annoyed and kicked my friend out of my house (who was also tripping), told him to piss off and never see me again. 

After this, I was on my own and  went through a period where my Shadow overtook myself completely (could be a demon/ayylmao too tbh, but I think its my Rejected Self). It was  a whole torrent of self hatred engulfing my consciousness, forcing me  to believe that I was ""evil"". I truly believed at this point in time that in my past lives I  was a Luciferian elite  (think asshole criminal banker working for the Cabal or something like that) and that God now wanted my to erase my being,  or face my death at the hands of another (in a far more brutal way)  within the next 3 days. So I took matters into my own hands, accepted my  impending doom and stabbed myself multiple times over the period of a  few hours. I was bleeding out for hours, and thought that I was already  dead, but in a Hell so to speak.

I heard voices, one that sounded like a Dutch guy speaking English; it was mocking me in a way and  sounded like it came from my speakers (speakers were off). I had certain  thoughts, where I thought that a motorcycle outside was actually a dude  with a chainsaw about to cut me to pieces if I did not carry out  certain tasks and every time I had these thoughts, the Dutch guy would  say some sarcastic bullshit admist a sea of gibberish. 

Another set of  voices, one that sounded like multiple beings talking all at once, in a  hissing sort of voice, all claiming ""ahh, those of the mixed races are  always the most fragile"". Not long afterwards, a mantra appeared to me to cope with  this ""Hell"". It was ""I give my All to the One, I give my One to the All""  and I repeated that for 3-4 hours through the pain, the heavy breathing  and fevers. I just sat there, awake, bleeding all over the floor. It  was a scene out of a horror movie. Once the trip wore off, I realised  that I was not dead, and should just call an ambulance. Was still  bleeding a bit here and there. 

Since then, I have almost no willpower or motivation left. I try  going to the gym haphazardly, I try to work on my uni assignments, I try  to meditate. Nothing happens, and instead I smoke copious amounts of  weed, meet up with some friends, or play videogames or watch stuff for  the last 3 months. Idk what the fuck I am supposed to do in this  situation. I am a little angry at God, at the Universe, for bringing me  back to square 1; the shit I wanted to leave behind is back and the work  I did amounts to NOTHING. Months of my life wasted over NOTHING. All of  because of some shit-tier ""acid"" (I don't know what the FUCK that shit  really was).

All I am doing now is lying to people (parents, friends, professors  etc), pretending I've got my shit together, but its spiraled out of  control. Idk what supposed to do. I feel so disempowered to do anything.

You guys got any advice? Because I wake up in the morning, and feel like life is garbage, like there is nothing to look forward to, and frankly, I feel empty. I try to use mantras, saying ""today's gonna be great"" or ""trust in the Universe/God"", and I feel slightly  better, but then I just end up doing the same. I wake up, say I am gonna work, procrastinate for 3-4 hours, and do nothing, and then smoke a metric ton of weed whilst being anxious about the assignments I have to hand in, the fact that I am gaining weight and am going to end up a loser for eternity. 

I know that it is related to spirit, because this incident with the acid has completely drained my will to exist. Been having episodes where I feel a huge torrent of rage one minute, and then the next, the desire to break down and cry. Its really fucked up and I never had an issue like this to this extent in my life. You guys got any idea? 

Sorry for the long ass essay.

TL:DR had a bad acid trip, lost my will to live and am not getting any shit done whatsoever. ",new,How to regain one's desire to live and move forward?,3

But damned if her words and messages aren’t synchronistically my current situation and mindset. Every. Single. Time. Here is the full text of her most recent message:*

#Dear Ones,#

You continue to be more task-oriented than child-centered. Yet your most direct action path is a child-like belief, innocence, and play. All of which most of you push to the sidelines as you complete one should task after another.

Even though you might enjoy those tasks, enjoying them does not necessarily preclude child-like fun and innocence.

Do you not feel some sparkles of joy and innocence when you observe a small child in Santa’s lap? Reviewing memories of how you used to believe in magic and joy without boundaries.

Likely, your flashes of joy or child-like fun are pierced by thoughts of what you should be doing – and enjoying it as you do. For you have shifted your joy from special occasions to everyday tasks – as we requested. Yet, most of you have not yet shifted your joy to child-like fun.

Child-like fun is created when you have no objective other than play. It does not matter if the floor is dirty or tomorrow’s presentation is complete, you merely drop personal shoulds to play and giggle.

You counter that you must finish the report or you might not have a job or clean the floor for a visitor – again giving your power to others.

You continue to push play to the end of your day or other smaller segments instead of awakening each day to plot giggles instead of daily shoulds. It is likely that if you fully allowed yourself to follow your giggles instead of shoulds, you would discover more efficient preparation or cleaning skills.

Relax and play more and your seemingly endless list of shoulds will melt away. Continue to focus on shoulds and play will falter, then fade into nothingness.
You cannot be new you if shoulds dominate your being.

Trusting new you will occur when you allow yourself the freedom to be in all your child-like sparkle.

Perhaps you cannot understand what we are speaking of for you have always established a to-do list that must be completed before playtime. When in truth, playtime will greatly decrease your to-do lists in ways you cannot yet imagine.
When work of any sort becomes part of your playtime, that work will dissolve easily and quickly.

Of course, you do not believe this concept is possible for you were trained to believe hard work produced results and play merely postponed the drudgery you faced after playtime.

Let us give you another thought that might help you switch activities from work-time to playtime. You are a new being in a new physical body so that which used to be required is no longer. You have different skills and interests than was true in 3D.
Your current difficulty is trusting those new skills for you remain convinced that hard work is required for all forward action. The opposite is now true. Hard work only creates more hard work as you focus on the diligent efforts to complete the task.
Your new approach is asking yourself if a task will be fun and if not, do not complete that task until you determine within yourself a more fun approach or no approach at all.

You are no longer of 3D. Yet you continue to approach “life is difficult, you’ll never get this done,” etc.

Trust your new self, enough to complete the task in fun instead of drudgery or not at all. Perhaps that task is not needed, or you will discover someone who enjoys doing this for you as you enjoy doing that for them.

You already know you do not have the same interests and skills as others. Yet you expect to enjoy all of the skills you found necessary in 3D as you trudge through those areas you really do not enjoy.

Your future is to play with what you enjoy and expect that someone will complete those tasks you do not, or you will create an easier way of completing them.

You are a new being in a new body with new skills and interests. Even though you have perhaps shifted your perceptions of those tasks you feel are drudgery, it is time to shift those tasks from shoulds to playtime or no time.

**You are free.**

Your new focus is child-like play. Any task that does not feel as such can be negated, shifted or created anew. All are within your new skillset. You are no longer one of the crowd. You are a special being with a special task not the least of which is claiming yourself through child-like innocence.

As a child, you expect to be cared for and fed. The same is true now. Expect those uncomfortable or abhorrent pieces to be completed in ways you cannot now imagine. It is time to open your child-like expectations that your reward for a job well-done is the freedom to create different methods of completing tasks.

You do not have the interest nor the energy to focus on unpleasant tasks. It is time for play. Play as you create your life of ease and giggles. So be it. Amen.",new,"“Your new focus is child-like play. Any task that does not feel as such can be negated, shifted or created anew.”",18

All ""religions"" were man-made and instilled into our collective memory through the teachings of the ancient Pleiadian rebels. However, spiritual evolution is impeded through the false teachings.

*It is time for us to change; to free ourselves of our religious,political and dogmatic scientific institutions and ""normality"" of how we view religious institutions, government intuitions, political institutions -- and our selves.*   **It is time to grow up.**

Earth is a living being. It is a uniquely beautiful planet.  The Masters of the Cycles are appalled at how badly we treat her.

Humans are at a crossroads. We have been led down the wrong path by the controllers. Either we work hard to get out of this mess or we will be destroyed. A shift in consciousness is imminent and we must choose our path.

It was told to me that the Masters of Cycles & Suns of Light not incarnated in man:

They generally like us. They especially like our imaginations, creativity and dreams.  They love artists and writers and ironically drunks and addicts.  They can not understand our ability to be dominated by such basic functions.

**When we meditate, pray or dream, THEY CAN HEAR US!.**   **~~Our subconscious and their awareness are linked through the quantum field.~~**

It was said:

A great change is to come.  It is unknown when, but they are certain that it will happen soon.   We are being conditioned for that day.   **This conditioning occurs during normal restful sleep and \*\*\*\*****^(meditation)****\*\*\*\*.**

To finish up & touch on what was discussed yesterday:

In the beginning of this universe ""a""  ""they"" some ""it""  ""who""  Divine Creator"" --    Something **created the  “Games”**.

The Game for this Universe was called Polarity Integration.

0,a5lu6t,15,16,"So I have been experiencing intense negativity for a while now. (I'd blame it on mercury retrograde if i hadnt been feeling it for the last 6 months) I've been hating. Like, hating everything. Myself, my friends, the earth. 

 I feel like my life is a self-inflicted punishment. I asked to be born here. I was warned that it would be hard. And now all i want to do is leave. I want to die, i want to go 'home' as it were. I've hurt a lot of close people in my life, and I can follow the echoes of the behavior that caused it back to my previous life. 

It hurts. Everything hurts. I always want to cry. I want to be free of this pain but I already know it follows me. So i Trudge through this low-vibrational existence because I must. Because I ASKED FOR THIS. The human experience on earth. The purest human experience. 

I loved humans before i was one. Now i hate them all. And that hate makes me so tired. Its an unnatural feeling. Its not me.

0,a5knmd,13,55,"The energies are getting intense it feels like. The universe is practically handing you all that you’ve been wanting for your next step of growth. The thing is, you need to know what you want and put it into action.

The Principle of action. (or something like that) you need to set the intention, forget about it, but implement it into your life. You need to do what it is you wish to do, even if you don’t feel like you have all the requirements to do so.

The universe is handing us the energies to break away from all the things that have been holding us back from reaching our truest potentials and our biggest dreams. No more playing around, if you want it, you need to grab hold of it and not let go. Don’t let anyone or anything swing you off the path that you know is best and true to yourself.

Those of you that have been working so hard to raise your vibrations and spread the love that you wish to bring to earth, it’s working, and there’s a huge step about to be made in your journey as long as you can get past all the illusions.

Emotions, people, job offers, anything. There are many that will come along to try to get you to miss the thing that it is you truly want. No matter what it is, if you know it’s not what you truly want, wait it out. Patience is so very, very key right now I feel like.

It’s the end of the year, and the harvest is here to clean up everything that you no longer need in order to shine the brightest you can.

It seems as of recently that a bunch of my negative habits have been surfacing to my attention. A lot of them I am having a harder time controlling than normal, and I am not sure why. The two biggest ones are pornography (which I have decided to stop watching all together) smoking marijuana (I go off and on about wanting to quit and have been for years) and taking adderall (which I am prescribed but lately have been abusing it way more).

I feel like all of this coming to the surface at once isn’t coincidence, wanted to see if anyone else has had anything similar happening ",new,Negative habits being forced to the surface,12

I have a feeling it's going to be a super synch-y day energetically, and I'm also considering doing daily group meditations on here for it to try to aid in the process.
