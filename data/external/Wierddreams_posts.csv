0,ariugp,0,1,"So, I often have weird dreams, but that's the newest.  For info, I've really been missing my girlfriend (am a girl myself) and have sensitive teeth. 

In my dream, I woke up in a room I shared with my girlfriend, we're both wearing weird clothes.  It looks like white dresses with colorful accents and large hats with two pointy tips on the side.  The who looks Scottish or German....  With that, we have narrow face masks made of translucent grey plastic.  

Going out the room, I realize we must be in some sort of sect, with brainwashed people walking around with the same clothes, even men!  I don't feel brainwashed.  

We are guided to a room where they make us sit down in front of the projection of a manga that a man proceeds to read.  Once it's done, I turn around and see two of my friends, turns out they're not brainwashed either. 

But then my top left molar hurts and I run to my room where I literally just pull it out.  No blood.  

Then I think I fucked my girlfriend and my cat woke me up.",new,Anime sect and tooth aches,1

0,aps9wd,2,1,"Soo.. I just finished having the weirdest dream just now.. here's how it went: 

In my dream, I got bored of my usual games on my phone so I decided to download a new app which I dont remember the name of, but it had ""girlfriend"" and ""ari"" in it. Anyways, when I download the game, it emediately says that I could skip a couple chapters of the game. So here's the thing about this game: supposedly, it's a game where the character you play is a really strong fighter of either gender that had a sword of light. The sword was ""so bright"" that it blinded opponents, giving me the chance to.. idk, stab them? Anyways, in the game, there is like half ""choice""(such as choosing where you go, do, or say) and half ""oh, you said your favorite blank was blank so blank is deffinately happening"". When I get the the final chapter of the game because seemingly In my dream I read and finished all other chapters(dek how dream logic works). 

This is where it gets weird.
Apparently, I am fighting a woman who is a maniac, in a very tall building. Like in a city. But I have a partner. His sword I think was blue, with the power to slightly weaken the opponents power or to dull it (you'll see how I know later). So here I was, fighting this  woman, when somehow the maniac loses her sword? Dream logic. We both end up on the ground, with my back to the ground and the maniac crouching around my feet for some reason and my partner on his knees behind me. Yes, the battle wasn't that interesting or epic. Right when I took my chance to freaking obliterate this lady, my partner *DULLS* MY SWORDS BRIGHTNESS! wth partner. That's when the lady starts to lean over me and try to find something to hurt me, because my partner was dulling my power to an extent that made me like the average 5 year old with a cold. She proceeded to find a knife, almost axe-looking weapon. She tries to counter my sword, cuz I mean self defense, so she goes to my FEET. She then gets a hold on my left foot, and digs through the sides of my shoes and into my skin. Like, not paper cut, full on bone cuts.

Then my partner stops dulling my sword and I get to finish her off with a good stab in le eyeball(I think.. keep in mind dreams are weird and dont tell the full story). When I turn to face my partner, he has the creepiest, biggest grin I have ever seen in my freaking life. I didn't say anything, but I wanted to start to head back to wherever, but he said something like ""if you let me kill you, I'll push you out the window myself"" in this happy, excited tone....

BITCH


sorry.. anyways, when he said that, I think he dulled me because I felt weak in my dream, and I tried to escape by jumping off the building into what I think was a trash can? When my partner went into another room seemingly for a weapon to kill me(whilst yelling that I was a disgrace and that ""my brother wouldn't like if I ran away""?) i took my chance to jump off and succeeded, but not before getting a question for the game. The game asked what i was most afraid of. 


Right then and there is when i woke up. It is currently 5 a.m. on the spot. I really liked this dream so i thought I should share it..


TL;DR. In a my dream I have a new game, in which I have a bright sword that blinds people so I fight a maniac lady with my partner, who then turns on me, making me weak, so the lady hurts me but then my partner returns to my side. I kill lady, and partner offers to kill ME..?..so I escape and wake up from my dream. Now here I am?",new,Weird dream with a sprinkle of creepy,1

0,al9s56,0,2,"This was a while ago, last October or November.

The college dorm where I live, and where I am typing this right now, is a typical hallway-style dormitory with wings branching in multiple directions. In my dream, for some reason, the federal government was executing two criminals by locking them in a vacated wing of the building and burning it down. I didn't see it happen, but know it was happening because everyone was talking about it, and I came back from lunch and saw the wreckage and police vehicles. Due to the fire barriers in the building, the rest of the structure was fine and we all had to return to our rooms as normal. It was extremely disturbing, having to live in the same building where two people were just burned to death.

That evening at dusk, I went to visit some acquaintances (who were vague female figures that didn't resemble anyone in reality) upstairs in the building. The event earlier that day was in the back of my mind, but the creepiness had faded. There was a staircase leading from an entry-floor room directly up into their room, but at the bottom of the stairs, there were nearly endless storage units overflowing with sneakers and lacrosse equipment.

0,al8zqb,0,3,"Ok so this dream was interesting that it woke me up. So basically, I was in a place that looked exactly like my house. However, where our kitchen usually is, it was extended and had chairs all over the place in a row, like being in a theater or an auditorium. I was for some reason with my entire family and other people also arrived later on. We saw what was a young Matthew Lillard or well known as Shaggy Rogers in the live-action 2002 Scooby-Doo film. However, he was looking exactly like Shaggy from the film. I also apparently didn’t recognize him. We saw a screen come down with Matthew Lillard hosting what was a new Scooby-Doo live-action film trailer.

0,al7032,0,2,"I am terrible at remembering dreams so when ones like this come along and stick in my memory, I make sure I remember any detail. 
I recall multiple dreams last night, all involving Kevin Spacey, but it was one that woke me up. Kevin had invited two people into what looked like an abandoned room in some ancient asylum, where he continued to put on some form of helmet which attached to a speaker system in the room. He then mocked the two people before grabbing his chin and his forehead, pushing out his tongue and then, by using his hands, he pushed his teeth down onto his tongue, severing it, all while his screams were heard over the speaker system, without him actually screaming. He then grabbed a knife and fork and began to eat his tongue all while the screaming continued, I distinctly recall the sounds of chewing a tongue and even tasted blood on my own spectating tongue. 
It was the way he moved his head, as if his jaw was dislocated as he cut his tongue in two that I repelled at.
Now I immediately fathomed a reason as to why I dreamt this, as I had recently seen a few clips of Kevin Spacey in Se7en and one where he appeared to be tortured with various acidic items.
I don’t think this compares well with the other dreams here, as mine seems easily explainable and quiet cliche I suppose, but for me, that was mighty strange.

0,akd4mm,2,3,"I am dressed up as IT and I go for a ride on my dirtbike. I leave the house & end up driving +15 miles. Its not quite sunset yet but close and I point out the different colors in the sky to myself.

A car starts getting too close to me so I pull off to fix my eye makeup. As I am beginning to fix it the same car pulls up so I drive to this empty Chinese buffet place. They follow me to the parking lot so I go inside the resturant.

 The owner, an elderly Chinese man named Mr. Lee, is busy getting orders. I order pork fried rice & sesame chicken and the other guy, a manager(?), pulls me aside and tells me he likes my outfit. He offers me a job. I take it and call my ex, Daniel, and let him know I got a job. He is very clearly upsey because he never wanted me to work. I work there for a couple of hours while the girls from the car that was following me hang around. I end up getting into a fight with the manager and he fires me. So I decide to go home. 

I am walking home and another person in an IT costume tries to run up and scare me & a girl I am walking with (we appear to be friends but i have never seen her before in my life). I tell them they arent scary and hug them. I chat with them and the friend that is walking with me. Then we continue to walk home.

I ride my dirtbike the rest of the way home and when I get home it's finally daylight. I am no longer wearing the clown outfit. I go inside and I can't find my family. I am running through the trailer calling for them. ""Home"" is a run down mobile home in the middle of a trailer park that I have never seen before. 

A skinny, young, blonde woman comes to ny door and tries to get me to let her in. I ask her to leave. She refuses and I threaten to call the police. She disappears where I can't see her & I call the police. They instruct me to go outside and check to see if she is still there. Then I notice the roof of the trailer has flames coming out of it. I yell and my mom and dad fill up pots of water to put the fire out. It catches quickly and the whole hpuse is in flames. I call 911 back and ask for a firetruck (but I give them my old address instead of the new address. I moved out last year). While waiting for them to come we are able to put the fire out and go inside. The lady comes back and  tries to get back in, bragging about starting the fire & threatening to start another if I do not let her in. She takes off when the police come and they look for her to arrest her. 

Then I wake up.




Errors/Details that don't make sense:

-An IT costume? I don't own any kind of clown costume, never have, never would.

-I don't own a dirtbike. Never have, never will. I can't legally drive nor do I have any interest in driving.

-My ex and I broke up 7-8 months ago now. We don't communicate. Why did I call him and not my current boyfriend?

-This girl I am walking home with literally appeared out of nowhere. She is completely random. I don't know her.

-It appears to be Halloween but everyone is wearing summer clothes (October's here are pretty cold).

-I don't recognize this trailer or the trailer park it sits in. 

-Why did she want in my home? Why did she set the house on fire? How were we able to put out a fire with a tiny pot of water?

It was NYE and I was home from college and attending a huge public new year party hosted by my high school. (It's a small town that would do a party like that, but the high school wouldn't host something like that in reality). There was food and drinks in the school lobby and a showcase of the girls volleyball team in the gymnasium. All of our family friends and my alumni friends were there, but everyone was only an intuitive suggestion of who they were, I didn't vividly see their faces. The school looked more like how a specific high school in another nearby town looks in reality, but painted with our blue and gold. It was dark outside.

Last night I had a weird dream. It started in my house where I somehow had died and become a ghost. Ghosts existed everywhere and could see and interact with each other like normal humans, except the living people couldn’t see them (but if they touched me they’d feel me)
With that being said, I lived in my own house with the members of my family even though they couldn’t see me or interact with me. I had to be careful to always stay out of their way and move everything back to where I found it so people didn’t notice. Eventually this became very discouraging and disheartening because I wanted to talk to my family one more time but I couldnt.
And then I met this girl. She was a beautiful red headed girl who looked similar to Scarlett Johansson when she played as black widow. And eventually I impregnated this girl, and rather than deal with the pain of living alongside my family, we decided to move to the Canadian wilderness to live in peace.
We lived in an abandoned log cabin in a clearing in the forest and raised our child. And one day when the child was about four, a group of ghost hunters came to the house, and we had to flee. But before we did, the girl confessed to me that the child wasn’t mine and the reason she was dead was due to complications during childbirth (which also killed “our” baby). And after telling me this, we had to flee.
Eventually the ghost hunters caught her and I was forced with the moral decision of going back to rescue the girl who had lied to me and encouraged me away from my home for four years, or to flee and try to fend for myself.

0,9zxp9d,1,2,"I had a dream that I was 13 years old and going shopping with my mom at Walmart. For some reason we decided that we needed to be at the store for 1 hour and 23 minutes. I got bored and wandered off, then an idea for a prank popped up in my mind. I grabbed a shopping cart, filled the whole thing with condoms, in hopes of people (adults) walking by the cart and feeling weirded out, while at the same time doing so without getting caught and without it getting seen by kids. There was an entire isle in the corner of the store that only contained rated M games and rated R movies. I placed the cart there and my plan half succeeded. The cart was seen by 6 people and none of them were minors. Unfortunately I didn’t notice the isle was right next to where the flowers were (because reasons) and mum saw the cart, which I also tried hard to avoid happening. She knew it was me who did the “prank”, because I was suspiciously nervous, but I wasn’t confronted about it, until later.

Later happens and we’re in the breakfast room of a hotel and the room has a staircase cause it’s a 2 story room. I’m upstairs and I brag about my prank on Reddit and I get exactly 1102 comments 67% consisting of people roasting me REALLY hard. 13 seconds after posting this my mom confronts me, yells and me and was so mad about it that she gave me a $5 bill and 3 ones (8$), which caused me to instantly turn 18. My punishment was that I was supposed to drive to the movie theater and watch a movie. I instead stopped at McDonald’s and bought a small chocolate milkshake, without whipped cream. This caused the dream to crash, before I got to take a sip and I woke up at 2:58 and it took 18 minutes to write this.

0,9yqxh4,1,2,"I had this dream a day or two ago. Not sure if this would be considered graphic but I'd say it unsettling at the least.

Before I talk about my dream, lemme say that I have a skin condition called Psoriasis. It's a fuzzy yet scaley growth, kinda like a fungus, that some people can get on there legs or back. I have it on my head and neck. There's no getting rid of it, but there are times when it goes away and comes back. Nothing life threatening but annoying. When my psoriasis flares up, its typically not too bad. Sometimes it can get pretty bad, but nothing a couple head and shoulder treatments cant fix.

But anyway, the dream starts and im walking about my house and I start to scratch my head. The psoriasis makes my head itchy sometimes. But there's a lot of dandruff coming off my head. Dandruff being a reault of the psoriasis. But theres a lot more then usual. I scratch a little harder and small chunks of psoriasis start to fall, getting a little in my eyes. This doesn't happen in real life, but psoriasis doesnt burn your eyes.

I go to the bathroom and turn on the sink. I splash some water on my face and try to wash the stuff out of my eyes. I look up into the mirror and I see two big mountains of the psoriasis growth on my head. Its even caked over my hair. To describe it, imagine an ant hill. Put it on your head and make it white and fuzzy. There was two of those on my head. One was smaller then other, but the bigger one I started picking at. Not sure why, just did it out of curiousity. There's so much I could scrape chunks of the stuff off, and it felt good too. Soothing.

Eventually I scrape and scratch off the entire ant hill of growth off my head. I notice there's a hole underneath where it was. I tilt my head to look inside using the miror and almost the entire inside of my head is hollow. Empty. Its looked like the growth had eaten away at the inside of my head, which psoriasis cant do but in my dream it can apparently. And I could feel the emptiness too. I cant describe it, but the best way is to just call it cold. Like there was a breeze going around in my head.

So as I keep looking around in my head, I can tell there's nothing there. No brain, no skull, no flesh. Nothing. But I stick my finger in the while and I feel something. Not sure what. I couldn't see it but it felt hard. And when I touched it I felt this odd sensation all throughout my body. The type of static-like feeling you get when your foot falls asleep, but way more intense and all over. It was most intense at the very point where my finger touched whatever it is that it touched. There, it wasnt so much a static type of feeling but more like a zap.

I poked that area of my head three times. The third time the zap woke me up. The strangest thing tho, is when I woke up that zap feeling was still there in my head. Like it was in my brain, but in the dream I didn't have a brain. My head was empty. And the static-like sensation in my body was replaced with a mild case of the chills. It went away after a minute but seeing that giant mound of psoriasis growth on my head and peeling it off, I dont think I'll ever forget it. That whole thing felt so vivid and life like. And the aftermath, waking up after it at like 5 in the morning was so...like I said, unsettling.

I'm not sure what to make of all of this. Could just be my imagination making shit up as it goes, or maybe there's something to it. If you read this and think you can find reasoning or a hidden meaning behind this please tell. I'd love to know what it is.

He went up to this ravine in the ground, which seemed to be in whiterun hold, and a voice from below initiated a dialogue sequence with him, I don’t remember what she said, but it was definitely some crying wolf to get an adventurer to come down there. So he uses the turn ethereal shout, and hops down, after walking through a small narrowing of the passage into a cave, he enters this grove of corpses. I mean a goddamn GROVE, there are some bodies standing upright because they were waist deep in corpses. Here’s the kicker, every single one of them looked like his player character. In his case, a khajit with silver fur and steel armor, there are some variations, like hairstyle and gender, but little besides that. In the center of it all is Serena, for some reason, maybe a placeholder for my brain, she didn’t aggro for some reason. Occasionally he’d find some cold-weather breath fog coming from beneath the pile, when he moved the corpses out of the way (interaction not rag doll levitation) it was just a severed head that quickly split into two pieces. Need I mention that all these bodies are mutilated as hell?

0,9w4s1r,0,4,"So I only remember the last half of the dream, just before I woke up. My dreams have always been whacko. So somehow I was in like the setting of a book. But get this - in my dream, the song ""The Adventures of Raindance Maggie"", a RHCP song, was the title of the book and in my head the book was about an outcast girl or someone who had been bullied. I could see everything happening in the dream like in a book, I saw her being chased off in tears again and again, with others. Somehow I was an outcast too. 

ANYWAY - so also, in my dream, the book was by William Faulkner (?), although the setting was modern and I was more likely thinking of an author like James Patterson but for some reason the name Faulkner came to mind. My dad and family were also in it.

Before I get into detail, I AM NOT INTO SCAT OR FART FETISH, I just happen to find toilet humor funny. I was as weirded and kinda grossed out as you may be when I was experiencing the dream.
I use the term ""You"" because I am describing it as I saw the game(AKA: I have bad tendency to do this and already had wrote it out, this would require a big rewrite, just assume I said ""I"" instead of ""You"").

\-\-\-

I had a dream about a game which I think was called ""three crazy poops"", where you had to collect 3 poops. A gorilla sends you on this quest to get them. The gorilla wants the poops for food. Catch is, each poop is increasing difficult and offensive(in all ways) to get. You have to do a ton series of micro quests to finally access each poop. Upon getting the 2nd poop, the gorilla gets impatient with you and uses a jet pack to follow you and shoot at you every 5 seconds(bullet is slow so you can dodge it) as a deterrent of standing still. Eventually when you get the last poop you have to climb your way to the top of a cube mountain in the center of the map where then you and the gorilla use jet packs and fly off into the sky.
PLOT TWIST(Still taking place in the context of a game), you wake up and are in a cryochamber like thing being forced to inhale fart gas. After getting up, you find that you are aboard a space ship controlled by intelligent gorillas, however all of them are dead(presumably from eating poop) where you slowly try to make your way through several rooms trying to access the cockpit, only to get trapped in a room made of poop(Imagine like a space ship room except the walls were poop in a similar manor to conker's bad fur day(great mighty poo), or how the walls are gore/blood in silent hill games). The last bit of being trapped is what I assume happened because after that I woke up.

The only micro-quest I remember vividly was to collect a poop from this pirate area, except the pirates are floating lock/key people and when you collect the poop one of them yells ""that guy thinks he can steal from us, get him!"", and you have to unlock the lock people(requires you to twist a key multiple revolutions while the lock person is trying to twist it the other way) while fighting off lock people. This is the only micro-quest I remember vividly.
The entire ""map"" was like the inside of a box but green, and the ""cube mountain"" was in the center of the map. When I say cube mountain I don't mean like a pile of cubes, it was just a giant rectangular cube. It did have water pond on one side. The terrain was flat for the most part and plain undetailed green(I am 90% certain about this, it might have had pixel grass). The pirate area was in the lower left corner and wasn't connected to water, but it did have a cave thing(???) on the inside and did go under the normal ground level.
Granted the portions I am unsure about PROBABLY CHANGED due to the nature of dreams and their ability to defy logic. I know one part of the area would not possibly be able to fit in the supposed ""map"" unless it were non-euclidean space.

Part of me wishes it was a real game due to the shear absurdity of it, but part of me also wishes it remains buried in the deep dark corner of the ""vivid weird dreams"" part of my brain.

I was chilling at home walking around, and next thing you know I start hearing screams from the house behind mine (which happened to my grandmas in the dream).

But obviously we couldn’t use the front door so we crawled into an air vent. There were armed guards EVERYWHERE, even in some of the vents, but we managed to escape all of them un-noticed and get to the attic. When we entered the attic we were baffled by what we saw. There they were, all of the children that have gone missing over the course of the week. We safely got them out through the vents and out onto the streets. We called the police. The police arrested my blind and deaf grandma I was curious of what happened to my uncle but was to scared to ask. We were walking down the street to the police cruiser mindfully past all of the dead bodies and spewed guts all over the side of the house.

It was an odd refueling because the plane was on the nose of the C5 just sitting there.

In the middle of the night I was walking to a building in a small L shaped plaza/strip mall that was painted black. The windows were black as well and I didn't notice anyone around. Well, it was the middle of the night so that's understandable. Yet, I could enter the establishment I was in front as if I knew it was open. Unlike the outside, it was full of people waiting in line. There were a few lines, maybe 3 or 4, full of people wearing colorful clothes giving contrast to the dark interior. Everything in this establishment was painted black.

Apparently I was in a chicken restaurant and everyone seemed to want some chicken despite being midnight. I decided to go to the bathroom before I got in line, so I enter the restroom and inside it was like a sauna or at least a shower room from high school. Something like that because there were people showering with towels on. On my right was a wall, or at least I thought it was a wall. Turns out that was the pick up window. Yes, you pick up your order of chicken in the bathroom!

So I get back in line (don't ask; dream, remember?) and while I was waiting, I take out my phone. Suddenly some one grabs my phone. It was Don King and he started blabbering about giving up my phone for some great purpose or some such nonsense. Pretty much he was trying to convince me to relinquish my phone. Obviously I said no then this other guy wanted to get my phone but this person wanted to run off but I had a grip on my phone so he couldn't.

Basically myself and my four year old son, popped round to an apartment and introduced ourselves to Kim Jong Un.

Tastefully decorated, all white big windows out on to the balcony, maybe not what you'd expect ;)

Thing were very cordial, we said hello introductions all round. He asked if we'd like some roast vegetables.

We went into the kitchen where indeed he was prepping many trays of roast veg (carrots, peppers, onions, sweet potatoes). 

I complemented him on his large oven -it was twice as wide as a regular oven.

It was me, my mom, aunt, and three other cousins. Next, we went to this restaurant,  like a mix of Golden Corral and Longhorn Steak house. I remember going to the restroom with one of my cousins to dress in what I think was swimming clothes, as we were staying in a resort close to the restaurant. The restrooms were weird, but nice and unique. Let me say, there were no male and female restrooms, they were combined and open to the restaurant. There were multiple very clean and nice looking stalls with bright brown doors, one of which actually had a small camplike fire in it, yes I know that seems weird. But the thing in this dream that kinda freaks me out was a girl that was walking perpendicular to the restroom, remember the restrooms had no door and was open to the inside of the restaurant. The girl walked by with a strong look of lust at me with a huge, elongated ass that perplexed me. I know I may seem crazy, but the sight made me feel kinda uneasy. Plus, I know this dream was very illogical but that girl looked at me like she knew me. ",new,Ohio Restaurant,1

Except your vehicle is a wooden pallet, and the road is coated in a thick slather of coagulated sheep blood. For some strange reason, I accept his offer to do a demonstration.

My cellmates consist of 3 6 year old (don't know why they were six, but I vividly remember them being six,) children, and one 30 year old pothead. The warden had a literal attention span of 3 seconds, if you talked to him for more than that, he would simply walk away from you and sit on the nearest chair/stool. The pothead pretended, seemingly, like he wished to murder all of us, but taught us how to use throwing knives, anyway (they were actually kitchen knives, dunno where he found them). After this, the pothead tells us all to sit in this rather odd chair that looks like it's made out of cannibalized gas masks. the children sit down, but I run into the jail itself, face the warden, try to tell him my problem, but by the time I take a breath to speak, he has turned around. I peek into the door to see what the pothead is doing, and he is apparently eating something. (might I mention, the jail itself is, for some reason, a fancy dining hall.) I slink over to him, and he disgustedly mentions that he's cooked food for us all, and hands me a bit. It appears to be a potato. I almost ate one, but noticed the faces of everyone around me, and noticed they were all high. I took a closer look at the potato, and it appeared to be a pot-stuffed baked potato. I got semi-high off of the fumes from the potatoes (don't know why the potatoes were giving off fumes, but,). white lines and pink stars appeared everywhere, as a result of the high, I'd assume. For some reason, Suzaku from Code Geass was seated across from me, at another table. Not sure why he would randomly be inserted into the dream.

As I catch up to what I'm chasing, I notice it's a tall woman wearing a bikini. As I catch up to her, I jump on her back. It was strange though, as there wasn't the expected buckle from the person after someone jumping on their back. 

While riding on her back, I somehow get her to turn around and run the other way. Remember I said I had a gut feeling she shouldn't be seen? Well, there was something of a bit of mischief in me, like I wanted her to be seen by everyone even though I knew she shouldn't.
