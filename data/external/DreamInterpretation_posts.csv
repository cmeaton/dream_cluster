This is my first time I'm going to write something on this sub reddit. I'm sorry in advance if I have violated any rules so far.

I just had a dream last night, I was walking down the street and I encountered a person who's very ""ugly"", with a scary face. He startled me, so I decided to kill him. I followed him around the neighborhood with a knife hidden behind my back and my left hip underneath my shirt. I wanted to stab him on a drugstore but kept telling myself that there will be cameras and I will eventually be identified. I waited until he was closer to his home, stabbed him the second he opened his door, and left. I kept thinking, nobody saw me, I can't be traced down.

When I was leaving the murder scene, he walked behind me and told me : ""Why did you stab me ?, what did I do to you ?"" I didn't know what to answer so I stabbed him again and ran away. Of course, it's really hard to run in a dream, I was incredibly slow. I had to get rid of a heavy backpack (apparently I was wearing a backpack), to get to a famous author's home faster. Once I was there, I knocked on his door and entered, the author saw me, I got on my knees, pleaded, and begged him for forgiveness, I confessed everything, and I told him : ""I wanted people to remember me, please write a story about me and my murder"".

So the dream starts with me and my little brother playing with toys in our house, while my parents do taxes. My brother has a wooden train and I have a metal spoon. As we play with the toys our house starts morphing into a mansion. My brother and I dont recall getting to the mansion, and we start getting weird vibes from the surrounding bookshelves. At this point the living room has morphed into a library. My brother and I set down our toys and start looking around, ignoring our parents muttering. We find that there aren't any doors or windows and just say eh, and start looking at books. At this point we start to get really bored, when some mannequins manifest nearby and try to get us to play with our toys. My brother is fine with it but I still feel like something is off. I take my spoon and get bored with it as my brother gets bored of his train. Now the mannequins start getting touchy and try to force me and my brother to play with the toys, when one comes up with new toys. A diamond encrusted spongebob plush for my brother and a shopping cart for me. We push them off and run out the door that was apparently there. As we run out we hide in a bathroom, where it turns out Monty burns had been hiding in the back of my neck the whole time. Monty then explains to us that the mansion is an entity that feeds off of fun. The more fun you have the faster you wither away, and if my brother and I had played with the toys we would never have been able to leave, as the power the entity gets from your fun is used to trap you in. My brother is worried about our parents and Monty says that they are physically incapable of experiencing joy because they  are too stressed from taxes. He then tells us that even without energy, the mansion can still keep you in if it can trace your Scent, and the only way to mask it is to wash your face. I was my face but my brother doesnt know how, so Monty has to help him. But before we leave the mannequins appear. Monty sacrifices himself to save us, and becomes trapped. We run out of the front gate with the mannequins searching blindly for us. I hop on a motorcycle and drive into the ocean with my brother, and then wake up, but before I woke up Monty came out of the building, transformed into a mannequin calling for us to come back in and have some fun.

Hello guys! I was looking for a sub like this because I had a dream last night that disturbed me a lot and now that I googled some symbolism I'm scared even more so I really feel the need to discuss this, it would help me a lot.

So usually I don't really dream a lot or I just can't remember my dreams when I wake up except for nightmares. But since I take antidepressants I have really complex dreams full of symbolism, most of the time quite absurd and disturbing but not really scary, if that makes sense. This just being the explanation for why I can't really deal with this dream by myself rn.

So the dream:
I was lying in a field or something with my boyfriend and a few other friends iirc, it was nighttime, the sky was quite clear I think and we were watching the nightsky. The full moon was spinning around its own axis which at that moment was a normal fact to me, but it started spinning faster and faster. I thought it was super cool and told the others to check it out, they were excited, too. But suddenly it gets bigger and bigger and we realise its moving towards earth, got really scared and watched it crashing down somewhere in the distance, followed by a huge explosion. What followed is somewhat blurred but earth was going to hell it was everywhere on the news and we were prepared that humanity is about to find its end and that earth is dead for good, also the moon's crash was somehow humanity's fault.
Scene cut, I'm standing outside with work colleagues at nighttime during work, doing the typical smalltalk. I asked them if they saw it too when the moon fell bc it was super wild, they didnt know what I meant. I look up at the sky and see a perfectly intact full moon standing where it should be, everything normal. ""aah haha it was just a dream, thank god"" I realize. But when I woke up for good I was still very disturbed. I immediately checked the moon cycle, but full moon is tonight. I have spiritual beliefs in a way that I feel very connected to nature and the earth and see it as something divine, I have a spiritual view of the moon cycle and believe in a higher self that knows way more than our conscious self (including near future) that can be explored with tools like tarot cards and can manifest in dreams. 

So now, after a few hours, I researched some moon dream symbolism and found that quickly moving or falling moon warns about serious danger, and it's lowkey freaking me out. 

To logically approach this, I worked until 2am last night, spent a while outside chatting with my work mates and at one point I looked at the almost full moon for quite a while because it was right in front of me, bright and beautiful. Also I watched the In A Nutshell video about genetic manipulation and how humanity could use it in the future yesterday afternoon, which really disturbed me.
This ""oh so that before must have been a dream"" thing usually happens when I wake up to 50% and fall back asleep, my boyfriend had his alarm set earlier than me today, so this makes sense, too.

But to me as a spiritual person the moon carries a lot of importance so I find it hard to accept this easy logical interpretation. I am also scared by the fact the falling moon appears to be a such widely spread motive that it appeared in the short dream symbolism lists I found with the meaning of danger. 
I take the antidepressants for depression and anxiety, the moon, as we know, stands for the subconscious, so the positive interpretation would be that as I realised the moon was still there, it meant my generalized anxiety is irrational and the things I stress about are not real. But that's not really convincing me, either.
Then again it could generally just be the anxiety itself, telling lies, as usual, in a visual form. I generally feel the med-dreams pulling up some deep subconscious stuff, often linked to the mental issues I am now finally working on.

Do you happen to have some more ideas or anything to add to my theories above? Hearing other people's theories, coming from different interpretation bases, would really help me sort my head, no matter if your interpretations are positive or negative.

In my dream it was summer time and I stopped by a new pool. When I arrived a lot of people were just hanging out and playing under water. They were all human but were able to breathe under water. The water was very clear and it looked almost cartoonish, but still real. The drop into the water was very long and deep and the life guard told me that I needed to jump at a certain angle otherwise I'd hit a metal pole and die. 

I left the pool and the roads were covered in ice and snow, but it was melting. Nothing was slippery and I began thinking about the side roads and they are still icy so I can't drive in this weather. 

I went to my high school. I was looking for something in particular and knew if I got caught I would be in trouble. I knew the exact route to take except I took the wrong one. There was a navy Sargent in a locked room with a bunch of people. It was like he was monitoring prisoners. 

I turned around and walked up a different stairway. This led to where I wanted to be and nobody was allowed to use that hall so I knew I wouldn't be caught. One of my former classmates was going the same way. 

I went back to the pool and a bunch of people were there getting ready to jump in. The metal wasn't there from before and everyone was waiting for someone else to get in. One girl said, ""I'll go first!"" She jumped but the pool had no water and she died. It looked like it was a 100ft drop to the bottom. The platform we were standing on was breaking. Mine was fine but other people were struggling to get off. One girl broke from her ankles and fell into the pool. I looked at the platform and her feet were still there.

I remember Joey playfully punching the other in the gut as they talked about something vague, I can't remember the specifics but it sure was funny.

Next thing, I'm in this strangely large diner, I'm sitting in the inner part of the booth, the table takes up most of the room, the bench is one of those long wall benches that have a ninety degree angle at the corner. Across from me in the stools, sits Joey and the guy but they are just drinking coffee. To my right, is the Blonde Girl I've been seeing and even being in my dreams, this is the third time I seen here, I know it's her because she doesn't ever look at me, she doesn't talk, she is also my age, if not younger by a year. I see her and think, ""Why is she here? Why am I in my shoes this time?"" Last time, I dreamt in her shoes, was strangled in her shoes, I felt her body as my own and it was absolutely disturbing ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/alf8y3/craziest\_dream\_ive\_had\_in\_my\_life\_im\_perplexed/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/alf8y3/craziest_dream_ive_had_in_my_life_im_perplexed/)) And the other time I dreamt in her shoes, she was in some Space Station ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/aj0ft2/dream\_of\_being\_a\_girl\_in\_some\_weird\_ssp\_type/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/aj0ft2/dream_of_being_a_girl_in_some_weird_ssp_type/)) these are the only dreams I've been in this girl's shoes, I know it's her because she has straight blonde hair, kinda long, she's a little shorter than me, not a large chest, not as skinny as me either (I lost 70lbs in the passed year, I'm dangerously underweight.)

Anyway, I'm looking at her as she's writing down things in some pad of paper, she says she's going to do something but I hear nothing, all I hear really is quiet diner music, light chatter, and footsteps. She walks away and another blonde girl comes and sits down, she is visibly different and not someone I recognize, she's older and a bit wider, what's weird is I think I wasn't even sitting in this booth in the dream, like my sight as just from this position like an invisible camera. As we all know about Diners, the bench seat is always unnecessarily close to the table, she does the shimmy walk in between the bench and table right past me, like I wasn't even sitting there. Weird thing is, I didn't pay any attention to her or anything, I just kept looking in the direction outside the booth, she sits down and the Dream Girl comes back, sits down, and next thing I know the other girl starts bullying Dream Girl verbally, I don't remember specifics again but I know that Dream Girl seemed a bit insulted and looks in my direction (at the other girl) and I see her blue eyes, crisp and clear as the Maldives, I really do think she's beautiful of course, but here's what's weird. People that dream of individuals sometimes feel this emotion of unconditional love, or something along those lines. I'm not feeling that, I'm feeling nothing, because I am just a witness and not actually dreaming of sitting in the booth. I am solely visualizing all this. What's weird about this, is the fact that in my other dreams, I was HER and not ME, in the Space Dream I saw her from a camera-style view before entering her shoes, that's how I know what she looks like.

Is this girl real or just some strange reoccurring anomaly in my dreams? Should I seek her out or just consider it another dream amongst dreams? The reason I'm on the fence is because reoccurring dream characters are USUALLY people I know in my life, friends, acquaintances, bullies, family, and even celebrities, but I don't know who this blonde girl is and this is my third time dreaming of her.

So in this dream I'm on a cruise, yet my ""cabin"" within the cruise is something like a trailer/modular home outside but still somehow within the ship. All of a sudden I notice an infestation of bees or wasps in the ceiling of this trailer that is my cabin so I go to some sort of help desk to complain. How I transition from this seemingly outdoor trailer ""cabin"" into the public part of the ship isn't clear.

Somehow that part of the dream ends and the next thing I know I'm over at my dad's buddy's place for dinner with my dad and someone else I didn't recognize, and perhaps there are a few other people there. I also don't recognize the place but feel like, at least in the context of the dream, it belonged to his friend. This friend of my dad's is quite particular about certain things so some things obviously set him off. One thing that I think would do just that is exactly what I did in the dream; he came in with some grocery bags and for some reasons I started to go through them! As I'm doing this my dad's buddy is laughing with my dad and my dad getting upset with me. I ask him why he's getting mad even though I know why. In reality I would have never gone through this guy's grocery bags, let alone likely have an opportunity to go to his place for dinner.

In this dream I'm upset that I left my phone on the cruise (apparently the places tied in even though transitioning is unclear, or I just told this part to my friend for a laugh but I don't think so) as I was expecting the reply text of the friend whose actual text in reality ended up waking me.

The title basically sums it all up, but I can explain it a bit more in detail here;

I remember this section of my dream starting off with me inside a jeep. I was riding in the back middle seat, and the two people in front of me were ( what I'm guessing since I have no idea who they were) friends 

We were driving, in what I believe, in search for something. At one point we drove through a party. The settings was night, and ( while dreaming ) I interpreted as a college party ( just want to clarify, I've never been to one. It looked exactly like something out of a movie ). The only way to go through the party was to actually walk through all the people grinding and dancing the night away which had an affect on my anxiety. 

As I made it into the house, I saw a group of college boys making fun of a girl who seemed to be clutching her knees and rocking a little.

In seeing this I got infuriated ( all the anxiousness i was feeling, completely evaporated ) and told them to back off and get a life. They seemed to dismissed as if i wasnt really therr me. It wasn't until I went indepth and said that she was having an anxiety attack. They threaten me, so I threaten back, which made them scoff and turn around.

It starts in an Asian major city. Idk which one cause I cant recognize the difference in their handwriting but it's a big place. I know that I woke up and I'm with a girl but I dont know her face, as its blank with no features. When we go outside we noticed its empty. Like nobody anywhere except inside some food spots, and some music coming from random chariots on some random streets. As we walk around, blank faced people in the restaurants turn their heads to look at us. The first dream, nobody had eyes. Each following time, more people have eyes. I never remember the middle part, but we decided to go to the mall cause it's probably got some people. Its absolutely massive with huge stairs in the middle with atleast like 5 stories high. We go inside and it's dead again. Were walking quietly and see people in restaurants turn their heads to watch us and they're all shaking their heads slowly, with still blank faces. We go into a restaurant that has windows facing the street and a balcony with more seating. We get the food from a dude with a blindfold on, unable to tell if he had eyes, sit on the balcony and the only other people on the balcony are blindfolded. There just happens to be a pair of binoculars on my table, so I'm looking at the crazy view we have with a weirdly dark haze and I notice this chariot looking thing but no horses has 4 ""people"" in it but they move like Lego characters or robots. As I'm looking at them through the binoculars the one turns its head directly to me (hundreds of feet away but staring right at me) with eyes and a creepy mouth, huge grin, so I'm creeped out and drop the binoculars, so the girl I'm with and I get up to leave, but as the girl and I are backing up to go inside and leave we both get drowsy, fall over, and see the guy behind the counter pulling dark bags over us. We wake up in a random forest in the back of the chariot we saw earlier with the grinning lady, still playing eerie music, dim lighting, and they stop at this tiny puddle 10 feet in diameter, but very deep. They plop us both down, and the girl starts crying but neither of us can talk cause they towels in our mouths. They drag her over to the edge of the puddle, lay her on her back, stick her head under water like they're water boarding her, and use a canoe paddle to slit her throat. I hear and see her moving and kicking, but then she just sinks down into the puddle. Thinking the same is happening to me, I kneel in front of the puddle beside me and hunch over, only to be grabbed and put back in the chariot, and as it's going back into the thick forest I wake up. Every time. 

I also forgot to mention that each time I have this dream, more people throughout the story have eyes - but not colored eyes, just eyes with oddly large black pupils. Nobody blinks. The girl I'm with has eyes and a mouth but no nose.

TLDR: reoccurring dream of a nearly abandoned city that only has faceless and eyeless people inside restaurants. Each reoccurrence more people have eyes. Go to a restaurant and look through binoculars, see person with eyes and a mouth grin directly at me, realize we got drugged while trying to leave, dragged to a forest, and the girl I'm with gets her throat slit.

We didn’t last of course, and after we broke up (also in 7th grade) him and his friends harassed me for a long time. Although my ex seems to be over it, some of his friends still try to mess with me occasionally to this day. Just recently one of them tried to
contact me on social media, and I found
out a few days ago that he was recently expelled from my current school (the reason he was expelled is unrelated to me). Anyways, last night i had a weird dream. I was walking home from my middle school like i’ve done hundreds of time before, except i was walking with a girl. I can’t for the life of me remember any details about her, or who she was, or anything. But i remember looking
behind me in the dream to see my ex. He lives near me, so i wasn’t weirded out by this, only a little tense because i don’t like seeing him. When the girl noticed that i’ve seen him, she changes. She starts talking about my ex and his friends, and she says something about how “they all know where you live . They all know you”. She also said something about how she’d been in my house before. I didn’t know this girl. i was trying to walk faster to get away from her, but before i know it i’m in an area that looks like a forest. And not only is the girl there, but so is my ex and some of his friends, and they’re standing in a circle. The sky was pink and i was stuck to a tree, unable to move. I remember calling 911 while they talked to each other, but as soon as the operator answered the phone, they let me go “for now”. As i was walking home, i told the operator what happened and she told me i needed to come talk to someone at the station, and she couldn’t do anything since it was no longer an emergency.  
Now i’m not one to believe that every dream has some deep meaning to it, but i think this one did. 
My main question is, who is the girl? Why did they just let me go like that?

Very soon I am going to have to make a big life decision soon(don't want to go in too deeply), and just had this dream.  I am a big believer that dreams is your subconscious telling us something(disguised as images that we see or think about daily), but I have no clue what it means.  Maybe someone can help?

&#x200B;

So I am washing a dog in a bath tub and removing the dirt.  I take the dog out because the job is done.  All of a sudden, there is a little black kitten that is in the bathtub.  She is underwater and I'm anxious that she is going to drown.  But every-time  I'm about to grab her, the kitten pulls her nose up to breath.  Even so, she is stuck swimming in the bathtub.  Me fearing that the kitten will drown I grab her and take her out.  But then she jumps in again.

&#x200B;

Rinse and repeat.  I lay in bed sleeping(in my dream haha), but I have this hunch that the kitten is back and lo and behold she is back in the bathtub! I panic that shes going to drown(but again it repeats, nose or head goes up to breath and down she goes again swimming and trying to get out).  This happens a couple of times until......

&#x200B;

The next time I pull her up, its a black dog(different then the dog in the beginning that was brown).  I pull her out, and she seemed like the most loving dog.  The anxiety was gone, but the loyalty and love was there.  And voices where praising how amazing the dog was.

I stumbled upon this reddit and it is a savior for me right now.
Last night (Friday to Saturday) I had a weird and not really sense making dream.

I dreamed that I wanted to visit my passed away grandpa. Somehow I knew that if I get on a certain boat and pretend to work as a crew member I can sneak in. It all took place in the 60‘s-70‘s I think.
We were going overseas and I was told to change the tickets in a ticket machine used to buy an entry to the boat. 

I had to go deep inside the boat to open up the pipe in which a long string of tickets were attached. Long story short - from a small bullet window I was able to see that we were going to arrive at a port. Really small and next to a pretty big beach. On said beach I saw my grandpa.

Now that I‘m writing all that down I remember that it all had to do with a picture or a memory I had in this dream. I knew he would go to that beach and burn something. But he was young. Maybe in his 40‘s. Which matches with his date of birth considering he was born '37.

So anyways - he was there and I rushed out because the boat/cruise wanted to leave right away. I jumped out and ran after him. When I touched his shoulder he stopped and was confused. He didn’t know what to do and how to react since I wasn’t supposed to be there. 

Of course I was happy to see him and pretty quickly he was as well, yet he remained reserved.
We took a stroll through the city but kept close to the sea. I saw different versions of my grandpa walking past and by me while walking with the version of my grandpa I suprised. I figured that this must be some kind of version of heaven. Or at least his reality of heaven. There were different shops, some to grab coffee, some restaurants and stuff.

We went to another beach there to sit down, somehow my best girlfriend must‘ve came along with me because I remember us three sitting there on the beach.
We talked, he had pants on as always but one pantleg seemed longer than the other. I told him about it and offered to cut it so it‘ll be equal again. He agreed and as soon as I took a scissor out of thin air (lol) his pants were normal. Weird detail that doesnt make any sense at all, but maybe you guys can figure something out.
He then was aged more, kinda like before he got really sick and that being the most vivid memory of him by me.

Soon after we went for a coffee. The employee there was a woman, kinda freaked out to see me. All people there looked at me like I dont belong there. We took a seat close to the big window. 

Suddenly the whole shop closed down. Front door closed, glass window closed. I figured that the woman alarmed someone that theres an intruder. Not that I was mad, I expected it, but I was sad that my time got cut short.
(Since my mother and my grandpa passed away I dont really have a big will to live. Not that I‘m suicidal - I wont end it myself nor will I try to end it. Its just that theres nothing really holding me here.)

3 people that seemed like police came in and sat on my table. My grandpa went silent and and they just looked at me. They asked how I got here and I explained. Surprised just like I was, they told me that its usually not possible to go there. I had to leave. They were really nice about it and even gave me a little time to at least enjoy the moment for some secs.

So I stood up and asked the women „I know its not my time yet but when? When can I finally come back here?“
She was hesitant but then whispered „Saturday“


Then I woke up, I wasnt able to fully wake up. I felt like I was in trance. I knew that I will forget about it so with my last little power I took my phone and wrote „Grandpa visited, Saturday my deathdate“

The dream started with me sitting in a darkened movie theater. I can see two men sitting up front. They seem to be arguing. I listen in, ""She's not going to know what it means by watching just a couple of minutes!"" The other man says, ""Just be quiet,"" in response. The movie starts. There's no title sequence, but I know that the movie is called ""The Hero and the Heroin Addict.""

The scene begins with a woman that I do not recognize wearing a clean white dress standing in a lush green yard in a nice neighborhood. It suddenly fades to the same scene, only the woman appears to be battered and bruised. Her dress is dirty and ripped. The yard she's standing in looks patchy and littered with trash. The whole neighborhood behind her looks run-down. She begins walking toward the street. All the while, the scene keeps flipping between these two dirty/clean settings. She makes her way across the street and enters another yard where two children are playing with a ball. Same deal: in one version, they look happy and healthy, in the other, they look dirty, unhappy, and hurt. The children notice her, but don't say anything, they just watch her curiously.

She walks across their yard to a tree with a dog chain tied around it. She picks up the dog chain and circles the tree hanging onto the dog chain, and ends up walking back the way she came. 

When she gets to the street, the dirty version gets hit by a car and dies. As soon as she dies, we see a little girl wake up in a hospital. Then it flashes back to the clean version of the woman entering the street. She manages to avoid getting in by the car, but the little girl in the hospital starts flatlining.

I've been having lots of dreams lately, not quite sure why, and most of the time I can't remember what they were about, but this time it's been... weird, and has left me thinking.

&#x200B;

The dream had started before, but I think it's not important until a certain point. My mother and sister had gone on holiday and, deciding I wanted to surprise them, I travelled all the way to where they were and met them. They didn't seem very surprised, so I decided I would get back home and travel again with my father. 

&#x200B;

Somehow, because it was quite immediate, I was in my home country but I had run out of money to get back home, so I started heading there on foot. I ended up in a mountainous region, quite hungry, where there was a concert. Having forgotten my original purpose, I got in, and once there I had one of the most lucid feelings I've had in a dream in a while: I could feel the breeze of the mountains and see them with extreme clarity.

&#x200B;

At this point I woke up, fell asleep again and resumed my dream (though I'm not sure if they are connected). This time, it started with me waking up in what seemed to be a well-off district: there was a black, luxurious car parked in front of the house I was, and at the other side of the street there were some nice looking, Parisian-like buildings and very clean streets. Continuing with my journey, I made it to another city that looked like those western movies, with streets filled with sand and wooden buildings. There were some people talking about soldiers getting back home after completing their service, but the dream ended here, that I remember.

I grabbed her brother and held him tight against me and kept telling him ""it's okay stop crying stop shhh it's okay."" And my voice was calm but I could feel myself crying. I just held him until he fell asleep. Someone opened the door and I see them looking at me with the girl laying next to me and the boy sleeping in my arms. I whispered to them, ""get the fuck out.""

Two nights ago, I had a similar dream except it was me and my young teenager. We were in the mall dept store outside a fitting room. There was a group (like on the bus) and saw my mom. I hurried and tried on a dress but I had it on all wrong (backwards, inside out, arm hanging out my sleeve) bc In real life it drove her nuts when any of us had our clothes disheveled. So I knew it would get her attention. I asked her to help me and she stopped talking to her people, looked over to me and turned back talking and walked off. In my dream I felt like I wanted to go with her or her to stay and it broke my heart all over again bc she left me again. I hugged my young teen, smiled and we left the store.

I was in a fancy restaurant with my old middle school friends. I looked out the window and saw the night sky. All the planets were visible. I thought this was odd so I mentioned that you can usually only see the moon, but the others acted like I was crazy. Suddenly I saw what looked like dozens of meteors. I felt a rumble and I knew that they'd hit somewhere close. One of my friends turned on a conveniently placed TV, where a news person explained that meteors had hit a mountain and it broke pieces of rocks from it, causing them to crush whole buildings. Immediately I went to look for my mother.

I reached a field. Looking up, I saw a plane that was about to crash. It was spinning. I watched it go above my head and a few seconds later two helicopters landed. The pilots asked where the plane went so I pointed the way.

0.0,aqyigr,6.0,3.0,"Last night I (F32) had a dream about an ex (M34) who I'm still into, but who doesn't love me. I've been told he exhibits symptoms or behaviours of having what is refferred to in psychology as a love avoidant attachment style. I have been trying to end things, but keep wanting to contact him. I know logically that it will never work, but my heart won't listen to my head. It's tearing me up, even though I feel so dumb for still having feelings for him. I can't admit it to anyone, so I just rant about it on Reddit.

In the dream, we were at a party and at one point got into a car to drive someone from the party home, then returned. We were laughing and having fun. He was much happier and more affectionate than usual. We started kissing in the car and he asked me, ""do you want me to make love to you?"" 

(He would never say something like that irl, and when we were together we normally just fucked, but there were maybe 3 or 4 times where it did feel more like making love.)

In the dream, I didn't have time to answer him because just when he asked me that, I noticed that in the front seat of the car was another him, looking sullen and a little angry or maybe a little sad. The other version of him was watching us.

I don't remember anything else, but I woke up with a deep sense of malaise.

to spread the wealth among my family and peers. Vision faded and I awoke in my house but it was extended further, and I slowly walked towards a room that looked like it came out of the renaissance. It was full of woman, all of them strangers. They were sitting criss crossed on the floor staring up at a man giving them directions. In my hand was a stack of cash that I brought with me and laid to my side as I sat down next to one of the girls.

Next thing you know I was instructed to dance, a friend of mine came up with me out of nowhere and proceeded to dance with me. I felt embarrassed, but what happened next was even stranger. We all went outside to a pool and had some sort of pool party. But everything felt off. Shortly after they all went back inside to do whatever and I just ran down a concrete slope. I saw that a girl was following from the top of the slope as I made it all the way down. 

She caught up and I began flirting with her, we held hands and she led me to a church, the sky was dark, all around us it was night. She led me into a drama theater and I lost sight of her, then from nowhere a friend of mine and I were running through the halls pranking people.

anyway, this one could be the scariest dream i ever had, maybe  because it's long. usually, my weird dreams last for an hour. this one was 5~6hrs of sleep. there's a time when i kinda woke up, and the dream still continued when i slept again.


me and my friends went on a trip to japan. then fast forward to a time when this certain friend tried to kill me, with a sword, on my back. we were all there, but i was the only one who noticed it. i tried to tell them, but they didn't believe me at first. i then showed them the wound on my back (while it was bleeding). they kinda believed me. next thing i know we were running around because the killer was chasing me. we were swordfighting. however, my sword was kinda useless. it's not sharp. it's just like a bread knife in a form of a sword. his sword was very sharp. there was a time when i tried to grab it, preventing it from wounding my body, but my other friends (who were just watching while we fight) were shouting and telling me not to do that because i'll be more hurt. i tried to get some meat from him then i hid it somewhere because i can't finish eating it. idk what was that. maybe a powerful thing for him? more chasing happened, until we kinda won (yes, we had teams) because a member from his side helped us, risked his life for us. that member (my past neighbor) didn't die there, but he was really injured. his skin was sliced and all that. we thought we won. we were going inside our house and realized from an opponent (a workmate) that all the guns of the policemen (some of my members, including my dad) were lost. we knew then that they're gonna use guns. we collected the guns left from somewhere and hid ourselves in the house because it's made of something bullets can't wreck. after some minutes, i woke up.

that killer friend is some guy friend in my volunteer group that i randomly slept with. that night makes me puke, actually. i don't like him because his beliefs are kinda irrational and pure boasting. i realized this few days after that night. i liked him at first. he's been messaging me, but i haven't replied in a month i think.

location was in japan at first and suddenly it was near our house.

from my dream few nights before, my dad was pointing guns at my mom and i was grabbing them from him. there was also another dream wherein my past love was threatening me with a gun. he's gonna fire at my legs if i continue running away. (we kinda flirted at the start of the dream but then his sister was interested in me and i said i ain't a lesbian. she continued to be really clingy and i ran.)

So, I dreamt I was at the beach, but it wasn't really a beach. There was no sand, no dunes, just a barren rocky outcrop snugged up against these towering peachy, coral colored mountains. In the sides of the mountains there were tons of little interconnected shops and stores that I was exploring with a pair of friends. Every store that we went into was flooded with about a foot of water, enough to just almost reach my knees, but no one was commenting on it. It seemed fairly normal, and I felt too uncomfortable to say anything about it, so we just kept going. 

We weren't looking for anything in particular, we were just wandering around. Overall, everything was pretty pleasant at this point. Another friend entered the dream—a male friend who I'm fairly close with—and asked if we wanted to go swimming down at the beach. We said sure, and traveled down to the water with him. But the way that it was set up was that there was just a small little sliver of stone that inched out into the water before it dropped off into a great blue void.

Myself and my male friend swam out into the water, and sort of drifted away from the others. He was leading me out further and further into the water, and I followed without question, sure that he was leading me to something interesting. We kept going until the beach wasn't visible anymore, and the mountains had faded to blue. He said nothing for a long time, but then he pulled me close, his hands on either side of my face, looked me straight in the eye and *breathed* into my mouth before saying ""you need more air"". 

Then he vanished. 

I began to panic because I was alone in the middle of the ocean, so I swam back to the coast, but everything had vanished except for a small group of people. Some of them I knew by name, others just by face, but all the stores had disappeared, and so had my friends from before. We couldn't leave the beach, as there as no way through the mountains, but the sun was beginning to set, and we knew we couldn't stay where we were. So, we walked along the small precipice of stone that reached into the water until we came to a split in the mountains that opened up into an inland lake. In the center of that lake was a floating city, tethered together by boardwalks and rope. We traveled down to the village, and while the people were modern, the buildings were not. They almost looked like ancient ruins of some sort. 

We went to eat dinner as a group, and encountered another group of people that were just like us, but different. I'm not sure how else to explain it, but they were similar enough to almost be the same, only just a slightly off. We looked like each other, acted like each other, but we *weren't* each other. I could feel it, something was wrong with them, but they were compelling and charismatic. My group encouraged me to ignore that feeling. 

We were having a good time together, and they invited us back to their house. We agreed to go, but when we got there, their house was *my* house. I kept telling people that, but no one would believe me. Every time I'd try to open doors to *prove* that it was my house, the other group would block me and say things like ""you don't need to go in there"", or, ""don't worry about it, you don't live here"". 

I woke up trying to break my way through a door.

0.0,aqvf2y,2.0,4.0,"So to go as far back into my dream as I can... for whatever reason I was in a random house that had no logical or rational design.
I remember opening a door to a bedroom and there was just a long white staircase going down into the room. The staircase was as basic as can be, just plain steps that looked like they were carved out of stone. 
At this point I wasn’t necessarily feeling anything, no feeling of dread, no feeling of happiness... nothing. When I got to the bottom of the staircase I encountered a bare room with a solid white floor, no windows or doors. Except on the left side of the room, there was not a wall, there were 2 staircases (modern style, white again with rectangular shaped steps coming out the wall). 
At this point I turned around and in the center of the room was a friend of mine. This friend wasn’t a close friend but they were still friendly enough to where I could spend the night at their house. All this friend did was look at me and smile and then turn and walk off and just disappear to my right. They just simply vanished. I actually got a warm feeling from this.
Then I remember walking towards the side of the room with the two staircases. From the point of view where I was facing this side of the room head on, there was one staircase to the very left, and one staircase to the very right. They both led down into a dark area, not pitch black but rather one to where you could see maybe 10 feet in front of you. I walked between the staircases (they were about 100 feet apart) to this small wall that came up about 2 feet, acting as a railing between the floor I was on and the dark lower floor. 
This is where it gets weird. For some reason I become aware of a gorilla perched halfway down on the right staircase. This gorilla then proceeded to jump down further into the dark room to its floor. As the gorilla was jumping down, I for some reason leaped over the railing also into the dark room trying to land on the gorilla. ( at this point I was feeling only fear) I end up landing on a dark grey bed about 100 feet down from the railing and 300 feet across from where I jumped. 
I’m lying on the bed on my back with my arms at my side and I look up and I’m centered between the two staircases. I can see the two staircases clearly and the room isn’t so dark anymore, to where I can see the railing and anything that would stand up there too.
I look just beyond the bed and I see a shadowy figure resembling the gorilla but lacking any detail such as fur or a face. It was just black with no pattern or any detail. As soon as this figure got on the bed, I lost the ability to move or yell, and I tried yelling for help but made no sound. I felt two hands wrap around my neck and I was being choked. I wake up and this sensation doesn’t stop. I’m face down in my real bed in my real room, and there’s a pressure holding me down and I lack a ability to move or make any noise. At this point I sincerely thought I was going to die and was just hoping it was just another dream that you wake up from when you die. But it wasn’t a dream, because all of a sudden everything disappeared and I was able to flip around and look around. Everything was fine, and my dog was sleeping peacefully next to me. I think I had sleep paralysis but it still was the most terrifying experience I’ve ever felt. ",hot,A gorilla was choking me and I woke up and felt like someone was choking me still.,4.0

 The earliest I can remember was that a friend of my husband (I don't have one) that disappeared years ago contacted me to say that my husband is still alive but he is stuck in deep space. So I did anything to get there, and I found myself in a school bus with kids, which  brings me to my shuttle. The friend says that they sent someone already, but he didn't have the right suit so he died midway. I saw then a rocket going up and exploding. I put my suit on and went in my own rocket. Bumpy ride with a load of clouds and fire from the engine. I arrive in space, and there is a lot of trash, but after searching and almost dying I found the husband. He wasn't so surprised but he was happy to see me. We talked a bit, and then I saw the earth. That view mesmerized me, it was a kind of Space Odyssey moment. Then mirrors started to appear, like in a museum. But I could only faintly see myself, and saw mostly other places that seemed to belong to very far away times. The storm came back and I was obliged to go back to earth.
When I was back there,  I ended up in the middle of some teenagers cutting each other's hair. They tried to cut mine but couldn't manage. I then escaped, transformed in an octopus/spider being (I was seeing the situation from both outside and within), and after being kicked around I went to hospital to search for paracetamol. When I transformed back into a human being, I noticed with horror looking at a mirror that I grew very fat.
Then it changed completely, I was back to my old self with my current boyfriend about to take the plane, but they told us they replaced the plane by a long haul train..

It was a weird feeling of being scared to death, panicking, yet determined and when I saw the earth it was a monumental moment.. I wish I could go back there

My workers caught some kind of evil robot posing as a friendly, attractive woman and brought it to the lab. We could tell it was evil and decided to dismantle it, even though it would constantly be saying friendly things in its robot voice. Small talk, etc. It sounded like the latest high tech robots that some find creepy. But physically it was like an evil Alita, although I havn't seen the movie. It keeps trying to sweet talk us into letting it go. Hell no. We know it actually wants to kill us and everyone else.

Eventually we realize that the parts in this thing are actually growing back! Like it is repairing itself. We have to increase our speed in productivity of dismantling to keep up. We are very afraid of this thing, now. I leave and come back and we get this thing dismantled down to a nub. Just the face. A mask. And it continues to try to sweet talk us. It doesn't seem worried, just tenacious in regaining its control and power. 

I get very confused how it works. It's whole ""brain"" is just in this mask? It seems kind of thick and indestructible and we can't seem to dismantle further, yet it still talks. I turn it around in my hands as it talks and i look at the back of it as I see it blinking from the other side. Not putting it on (I'm a dude), but just keeping it in my hands. The back doesn't have wiring or anything. It's as smooth as the front. Clearly artificial, though. There was a focus on its eyes at this point, indicating that it sees the world artificially.

I put it down and leave. I come back to the lab and the mask has repaired itself into a head again! How are we ever going to stop this thing?! I hate this thing now and resort to more crude attempts. I take a screw driver and stab it in the eye. More like around the eyeball, trying to stab it into where it's brain should be, stabbing through the tear duct. I hear a ""crunch"" sound and it has a brief studder in its speech. It clearly didn't like that, even though it continues to try to talk normal like nothing happened. Clearly I hurt it and it's trying to hide it's reaction.

That's it. I can't think of anyone in my life who is evil or trying to change (kill) anyone. I can't think of anyone in a false identity (mask).

&#x200B;

I'd love some help analyzing this now reoccurring dream that i've had. 

&#x200B;

The first dream: I'm working at a hospital and there is an airborne virus that's black. Like a black fog. It goes into people and their breathing almost completely halts, so it's my job to breath through a tube into their chest until the fog passes and they can live again. There is a women staying in one of the rooms and I can see her through the crack of the door. The room is bright red but she is alone and facing the windows which have massive black curtains all the way closed. The door is locked and I cannot get in. I see the fog approaching her and she is screaming and I feel so scared and I am trying to pry open the door to get in and help her but I cannot. I know that she will die and I cannot get in.

&#x200B;

The second dream (last night): The fog is back, as are the colours red and black. The fog this time seems to originate in the sky and you can see it coming. The layers of clouds starting parting and reveal a black and red fog that comes down from the sky and starts attacking people by killing them through suffocation, the same way that fog did in the previous dream. I must run into a room and lock myself in. I am pulling on the door to keep it closed and the fog is banging down the door so hard and its getting more and more difficult to keep it out. There are others in the room but they do not help, they are too afraid and unable to get up as they are in shock. I must do this myself but I am truthfully only concerned about myself. Eventually, the fog moves on when it cannot get in through the door. This plays out two times.

I am a 21 year old male who serves at a restaurant, me and my girlfriend recently moved in to a new apartment for the first time, I started serving instead of cooking last year but I'm fairly certain I've had these dreams for years. I know i have submechanophobia and thallasaphobia, but honestly I think the dreams have given me my fear. I have to close my eyes and have my girlfriend guide me walking near dams or water machinery.

&#x200B;

On with the dreams; they almost encompass some sort of the same world. A main part is this really long and tall bridge, and to the sides its sort of foggy but there are rusty tall buildings, pipes and oil rig like things and just machinery I can't explain. I visit this place quite often and I relate it to a bridge almost nothing like it in my hometown for some reason.

&#x200B;

Another is based in a coastal town, we are out swimming and the waves get unnaturally big, they start sucking me out to sea, bring me back, slam me in to the sand or rock wall separating the beach from the road and then suck me back out. Eventually the waves would start pulling me down and down until I was at the bottom and I would be so scared and I would close my eyes and just cry and pray for the end as I felt fish graze me, movement in the sand and usually a very large presence in front of me. If we manage to escape the waves rarely, the town is full of thieves and liars and riots, almost as scary as the waves. I'd say I see this place second most often.

&#x200B;

Then a blend of various others.. sometimes I'm at the foot of huge futuristic dams, maybe inside looking at the pristine cogs and turbines in see through glass, other time rusty old decrepit dams. Sometimes I fall in to the water near a dam or  one just appears  behind me when I'm in the water and I feel it suck me against the grate to the turbine and I close my eyes and can hear the roaring and whirring of the turbine behind me until I wake up.

The dream starts out with me revisiting my elementary school, I go to see my eighth grade teacher, we're chit chatting, my English teacher comes in and I greet her but she tells me the way I addressed her was rude, I seemingly did not know her first name (I address teachers with mrs. ms. mr.)

Things change a little, we're in the art room of the same school, this time it's a class and I'm not revisiting school; it's a full on class. My bully is there and I sit next to him, things get fuzzy around these moments, a lot of parts get fuzzy but I'm trying my hardest to remember. I remember he was insulting me and I was getting violent, my teacher was backing him up so at some point, I grabbed something and tried to hurt both the teacher and my bully, but everything I did was completely ineffective, like as if I was too weak to hurt them. Weirdly enough, I would never do things like that, I'm not really violent, I'm not lucid in this dream. Please keep this in note because I don't understand a lot of the weird intricacies of what's going to happen next.

Later on we're going and get on a weird van-bus, im sitting in between my bullies, to my right, a bully, to my left, one bully and one individual who necessarily didn't bully me, also he wasn't a part of this part of my life,  he was a student in my high school when I was a junior. All of a sudden, they clap my head really hard, laughing at me, I do nothing, the high school student leaves, and so does the bully, the bully to my right tells me they did that to him too, but he called it a Triple Decker Slap, I sympathized.

This is where things I don't fully understand occur.

Ok so we're in this manor? It's weird because I remember seeing aa pool, but inside, it partially looks like my small house, while in certain parts it opens up to huge rooms and hallways. I go to one big room and find this uhh I don't know how to describe this individual, but she was like a transparent witch, I can't remember why but I needed her help. all of a sudden, things change and there's this weird person in a body suit, it's black, and he's following ME around as I'M standing in the kitchen. There's two me's walking around, I see my dad but he's wearing glasses and a button up shirt (this is NOT how my dad dresses...) I tell him ""You need to help him out!

During last year, I had multiple nightmares of not being able to shut the front door of my own apartment or an unknown house I am in, despite greatest efforts to do so. And also occasionally about burglars or other people coming in, without me being able to properly lock the door.

&#x200B;

These dreams have now been replaced by a less frightening but slightly more puzzling series of dreams. Mid-dream, whever being in one apartment building, I either realize I have rented or own several apartments, or at least unnecessarily have stored my stuff in a 'forgotten' apartment I somehow was connected to. Sometimes these apartments are intricately connected in a maze-like building, other times all my various apartments are in another area of an unknown town altogether.

There is always a sudden urge to consolidate apartments and to resolve far too many living situations because I have rented them all. Somehow my things are all over all places.

&#x200B;

My gut instint read the first scenario as a boundary violation or maybe fear of the unknown approaching.

But the second, I don't know. Maybe hidden opportunities or the need to concenrate efforts on on area? At time it feels just astounding to have amassed so many living spots, at the same time somehow frighteningly wasteful to be forced to maintain all of them.

In this dream, I'm on the back of a four wheeler with a girl I just met (I just met the girl in the dream, she's not somebody I know IRL). My brother is driving recklessly, so I have my feet out on the ground trying to steady the cart which is wobbling. I ask brother to slow down, but he dismisses the worry. We spin out, and I go sliding off the cliff, but surprisingly, I hang on with two fingers. The girl is hanging onto me. Somebody grabs my arm and pulls me up. I pull the girl up.  The dream continues. Maybe me and the girl will start dating; her parents are there and expect that to happen because I saved her life.

Background - I've not seem my brother in years and I don't talk to him on the phone; he's in prison. I've not dated or even tried to date anybody since I got divorced five years ago. I don't know anybody who the girl might be - she's young and Asian.

I remember tailgating a car really closely and all I was doing is slamming the breaks. I was completely conscious of the fact that I was driving stupidly and I was trying to stop the car but I had no influence over it. It kept driving crazy going really close to the edges of the road. The dream later transitioned to an unfamiliar strait road that led into a dark forest. As I was driving towards the forest I felt as though another car was following me even though I never seen it. In order to get into the forest I had to drive through a tunnel, as I was approaching the tunnel I jumped an unexpected ramp that flew me up over the tunnel. I noticed that I not only flew over the tunnel in my car but I also started flying over a bridge that was over the tunnel, then on top of that bridge there was an identical bridge that I also flew over. At that point I instantly realized that this isn't real and that this can never happen in real life, I kept flying up, the quality of the dream got worse until I woke up. After awakening I heard a super loud frequency in my head, kind of like an old tv but 4x louder. I was experiencing sleep paralysis. As I was laying there trying to move my body, my right leg started moving towards the end of my bed as if someone was pulling it (I didn't feel anyone touch me). As my leg was slowly being pulled toward the edge of my bed I started freaking out in my head a bit until I was able to move my right leg again.

&#x200B;

The second dream happened on a different car but still on a familiar road, this dream wasn't as long. I was driving and tailgating really hard and all I was doing is trying to break and stop the car but I didn't have any influence over it.

First, the pot brownie dream. I'm in my homeroom classroom from Junior year of high school, I'm sitting up front as the teacher talks about some shit. Behind me is my buddy (who I dreamt of before) who has a big Ziploc bag of brownies, he says to the teacher, ""You want some pot brownie??"" the teacher is like ""I'll pass"" but I say, despite my horrible experience with pot brownies, ""Hey I'll have one."" I get up and walk over to him, he breaks it in half and gives me the bigger piece, how generous...

This is where things transition, I don't even know if I ate it or not, but I did not feel high in the dream so I'm sure this short sequence ended abruptly.

Now, for the other short dream sequence, I'm in a car, in the backseat, and my mom and dad up front, dad's driving, mom's in the passenger seat. It's quite dark as we're driving on the highway, my mom is eating some candy from a silver bag, she's quite ecstatic and they're chatting and suddenly, she takes a handful and starts throwing the orange candy out the window (they were like orange balls.) She's laughing and happy, which is good. Suddenly, an 18 wheeler overtakes us and crosses back into our lane; it's tires are completely coated orange, we're all laughing our asses off, I'm especially laughing really hard, I look behind and there's another truck behind us and it's entire front grill plus the tires are all coated orange.

Another transition, this last dream sequence is quite odd and a bit disturbing, but there's some interesting guest stars, it's been a while since I've had some characters from film and TV in my dream.

This dream starts out with me looking over a huge valley from the top of a hill, it's absolutely beautiful and the enormity of the rolling hills leaves me in awe as I remember seeing it. There are houses and huts scattered throughout, not many roads (they were dirt roads, not paved.) some stone wall structures too, looked almost like some place in China. I turn and there's this big building, people standing around and sort of hanging out or something like that. Immediately I recognize my best friend (not the same friend from earlier; but another individual I've dreamt about) and he says, ""We got a situation dude."" We walk over to this little kid bullying this fat kid, the little kid is saying extremely rude things and before I could attempt to interject, the fat kid picks up the little kid and gives him the dirtiest suplex I've ever seen. It was brutal, everyone was shocked, Adults, teenagers, and kids. These two women console the fat kid since he's crying and upset, I walk up and tell the kid, ""Hey it's okay, you did good. Go home and rest little buddy."" I assume the two women were his parents; two mom's. They leave, other people around leave too.

So now it's me and my best bud, standing in front of this little kid who's unconscious on the ground. He says ,""Is he dead?"" I say, ""He'll be ok, I think."" We go inside the building, and we realize it's a Chinese restaurant, and I make the assumption at this current moment, typing this all out, that this was OUR restaurant, since no one was inside, no cooks or chefs, just tables, a counter top, and lots of food all ready to be eaten. I'm not really too sure why were inside doing, but what I remember is we went to this back part, and went into a walk in freezer, I stood outside it to hold the door open, all of a sudden, Bender Bending Rodriguez shows up, I ask him, ""What are you doing here Bender?"" (remember, I'm not lucid, but even my dream self was totally befuddled by the fact a cartoon character shown up in my dream. It's happened before tho, in my early childhood mostly) He didn't say anything to me, he just walked into the kitchen, and grabbed this enormous platter of fried rice, and was about to walk out, me and my bud ran to him and were trying to get him to help us out. After some time trying to convince him to help us, he puts the platter down on an empty table and says, ""I have a plan!"" we go to the walk in freezer, he grabs all these colored strings, and we follow him as he exits the building, along with him holding the platter of fried rice. He puts it down on the ground, and rigs the strings to the inside doorknob, and has it tied to the outside screen door, I ask him, ""What the hell is this for?"" He says, ""So you can get in if you need to."" We all then look down at the kid, he's still unconscious, Bender asks us, ""Why do you have a dead kid?"" my bud exclaims, ""He's dead!?"" (The kid is lying on his back, but his elbows are stiff, his neck is stretched, it's like he's perpetually stiffened) Bender leaves with his friend rice, and we walk over to the edge of the hill and we look down at this weird hut, with stone slabs placed in weird patterns, kinda like a traditional farmland, I don't really know how to describe it other than it looks kinda like some place in South-East Asia or China or something like that. As we're looking down at this place, these people in white jump suits (not KKK clothes! more like the white outfits guards in mental asylum's wear.) and they're beating the shit out of the women from earlier, I see one kick the woman out from the hut, the other is having her head slammed into the stone wall, it's absolutely terrible. I tell my bud, ""We gotta help them!"" he responds with, ""We gotta watch the restaurant."" I look back down... and that's as much as I can remember about this.

The last thing I remember from this dream is seeing something happen to the restaurant, a flow of toxic sludge floods the interior, but that's pretty much it for last night's dreams.

Some background on me, I astral project in my dreams more often than not, and I’ve visited many lower vibrational realms and have experienced “lower” beings. Odd and spiritual dreams are not an unfamiliar topic to me. However, higher vibrational deities are less common for me to come across.

Now onto the dream, it felt as if it lasted hours. I was a different woman, living my life and then I died. This cycle continued again and again, once even being a man and then I came to the last woman I lived as. I was in some predicament involving a man and I chose to take my own life, jumping from an indoor balcony. As I was about to hit the floor, everything began to melt together. I melted into it as well. I knew I was dead, and at first I was afraid but then a safe and warm feeling came over me, I was at peace. I became one with everything. Then I felt somebody lift me out of the everythingness and I was crying saying I didn’t want to go back. It was an older man and he began to form and mold me as I cried. He told me that I have to go back, and told me what I have to look forward to and need to do in this next life. Who I would be. 

I don’t remember how the dream concluded, just that I woke up in a cold sweat with a feeling that this dream was important.

I was having weird tingling sensations all over my body.

So I had a fairly weird dream last night. I don't remember all the details, but I was essentially meeting an old high school friend and his new girlfriend at my university (I really miss my high school buddies, I see them in my dreams all the time). We were going somewhere from the uni at about 18-20 o' clock, so it was dark outside. There was a hill near our uni, which was unclimbable because of a building that blocked our path (we wanted to get up the hill). There were supposedly stairs somewhere we could have taken, but I decided that taking the elevator inside the building would be easier. 

The elevator itself was nothing but a chair that went up and down in a vertical pipe. It still turned out to be extremely complex in its functionality, with multiple wooden, hastily-assembled buttons labeled with different words in the big control panel right next to it. I tried to ask my friend how it functions, as he was apparently familiar with it. He started telling about all the amazing things you can do with the elevator (like emulating old video games) and how many different floors it could reach. I tried to politely tell him that I just wanted to go the upper floor.

Eventually I sat on the chair and pressed certain buttons. At this point I noticed that the elevator was extremely unsafe, with the only thing preventing me from falling off it mid-ride was my ability to hold on two grips underneath it. Nevertheless I managed to successfully reach the next floor, and somehow ended up in the middle of someone's apartment, with some people relaxing on a nearby bed. They weren't shocked or anything, as they were familiar with the elevator's existence. Next I saw my friend come there with me; he had apparently quickly taken the stairs while I was riding the elevator. This is where the dream ended.

I saw her and my aunt (who had passed away the year before) sitting on the couch and I walked over and sat with them and talked for what felt like forever. I was very happy to see them, and apparently had forgotten they’d passed away since everyone was acting normally. Fast forward to a few hours and the realization that they’re not alive hit me and I try to explain that to everyone around me.

I also missed her birthday the year prior due to getting stuck on the far side of town and not being able to find a ride which everyone in my family was angry at me for. Anyway back to the dream, upon realizing that she’s dead and I can no longer call her to tell her I love her and I’m sorry all I can remember is crying out in darkness “MAMAAA, MAAMAAA!!!!” Till I feel her warm, wrinkled hands grab hold of mine.

Caleb used to be my best friend until a thing happened and we essentially hate each other, Jessica was someone from high school who used to hang all over Caleb and she hated me. Rachel is my friend who used to be my best friend until the thing with Caleb, then I cut all ties with everyone and I’m getting to be friends with her again. Anyway, here’s the dream...

Then when I get to prison they gave me a cell that was a decent size with an orange rug with blue shits and matching decor. And I was dressed in standard orange attire, and my personal officer(?) kept telling me to stay strong because he knows I didn’t do it, but I did? And I couldn’t do normal activities like writing or drawing or anything because they thought, since I was a murderer, that I would kill them with the pencil or whatever. My jail cell had no door, but I couldn’t leave, like. It was against the rules so I didn’t do it and I was always nice and never did anything bad, like. Irl when I’m stressed I clean, and in the dream that’s all I would do. But one day they came and got me for lunch and I went and ate I think? (This part I didn’t dream but I knew I ate) but when I came back to my cell Rachel, Caleb and Jessica (😒😒) were in my cell waiting for me and I just, broke down crying, Jessica gave me a disgusted look and left with Caleb, then Rachel reluctantly followed them and left me alone crying. Then my parents came in and I asked them if they believed I killed a person and they wouldn’t look me in the eye and I remember asking them 3 times specifically each time telling them to look me in the eye and they never could, so I woke up crying. Then I fell asleep and back into same dream, once they left I got a roommate, I dunno who it was but they’re family treated them like it was a rehab facility(which I can understand now, to me it was a prison) and the father of the family started going into cardiac arrest so I was yelling for someone to come help and no one would come help, it was just me and the family. So I leaned out the doorless doorway but it was against the rules but I did it to get a nurse who was walking very slowly to me yelling to get  back in the room because I broke the rule, then I woke crying again. When I fell back asleep it had been about 5 years and it was just me, no guards, visitors, nurses, roommates. Nothing, no one. The. My personal officer came and I said I could do community service, so I drive to a school and started tutoring students then another year passed and they made me go into the military. Then halfway through my rotation I got a letter stating that the person who was murdered committed suicide and that my prints were on the gun because I tried to stop them. Then I woke up crying.

I was on some sort of tour group and we (myself and people i have never seen before) were walking through these fields and people kept asking “how much longer” and the guide just said “you’ll see”.

They were all dressed plainly and modernly. The middle one had blonde, curly hair while the others were constantly changing appearance (if that makes sense). They told us that they would answer any question we had but I was extremely cautious while still awe-inspired. I felt like they were so much more than I could comprehend. Everyone else had questions about how they died and who missed them and I just asked about the goddesses (how they came to be, what its like, etc). This happened around three or four times (leaving and coming back) before one of the middle goddess refused to let anyone speak but me and she asked why I never asked about myself. I said I was afraid. She picked me up into my arms and then she delved into my life. I guess I was dead as she said I “had committed suicide before march had a chance to end”. I was just bawling. They were holding me in their big arms (they all seemed to be larger than I could understand. I literally looked like a small cat compared to them) and I kept having these flashbacks to my life and crying harder and they just kept me there, comforting me.

They were weighty robes, made from hard-wearing material but I don't remember them irritating my skin. I was stood in the lower half, towards the plug hole and I could see a huge crocodile facing me at the opposite end - a very well fed and meaty fucker! - aware of my presence, but in no way in a rush to hurry over. He began sauntering towards me, his scaly belly rubbing against the enamel floor, which produced unpleasant abrasive vibrations I could feel in my feet at the other end. There was a sense of inevitability brewing. Like my demise had already been determined and I was to just here to watch it play out in this dream.

As soon as I caught wind of this design I began to panic, immediately trying to call upon some dormant mystical power within that could get me out of there, or materialise a weapon with which I could kill the croc. But I remember the sinking feeling knowing that neither of these options would be available to me. I wouldn't be able to draw upon any external source to aid my escape. I was powerless, and the cause of my end was a lot closer now, steadily advancing at the same ominous pace - the vibrations underfoot and atonal sounds of the croc's scraping belly really jarring my insides. The crocodile seemed content for me to take as much time as I needed to exhaust all possible escape plans, because it knew all were futile. 

By this point I was balancing tentatively on the grating in the middle of the plughole as attempts to climb up the sides all resulted in my sliding gently back down towards it.

Then a realisation about what I should do came to me. What I was most afraid of was not being rendered dead, but the indignity of dying in this way - excruciating pain and my desperate screams for help reverberating in a cold sterile chamber as the crunching and popping of my bones in the crocodile's jaws violated my ears with a quality which was beyond intimately vivid. No fucking way can I let this happen! So I detached my mind from my body. Disconnected the two somehow. It was only when I needed to that I knew how to. I relinquished my body to the crocodile while I remained present as spirit, conscious of what was taking place around me, but not physically connected. Uncoupled from all pain.

Anyways, so i ended up thinking my friends were being deceptive (and they were) and whenever i shut whichever one that matched out, the dreams would stop and I'd get a pretty nice one. It ended up with me having to tell my boyfriend i was breaking up with him because he overall wasnt very nice to my friends and family, and pushed me around and manipulated me. I left him, but didnt completely shut him out.
I started talking to another few friends who typically had my back and never really gave me a bad vibe, and then i had this dream.

""I emerge from a dark tunnel into a large cavern, outstretched before me is a bridge of rock leading to an equally dark tunnel on the other side of the cavern. Beneath the bridge a river flows with great speed carrying the bones of humans as they are carried down river. A tall, gaunt man in white rags is at the centre of the crossing with his back too me. I know I have to cross. As I approach, he doesn't move. I try asking and then pleading for him to let me pass. With no movement or indication, his voice whispers in my ears.  (I can't remember the words only the cold dread they made me feel) I looked over the edge into the river and decided I had to jump.""

To clarify a few things:

&#x200B;

\- I have no pets, never considered getting one.

\- There are cats around the neighborhood yowling at times, but none of them are white. Nor do I see them much.

\- Yes, I love cats. But I also love dogs, wolves and lizards and I am yet to have a dream with them in it that came out of the blue and as vivid.

\- There isn't anyone at home replicating or even hinting at this behavior.

\- I tend to associate dream cats with a particular god I've been doing research on (I mean, I've already done it, I just they're really cool and still on my mind).

\- I've had like two more dreams with white cats. I posted here once explaining one of those dreams.

Bonus Q: I read once that in dreams you don't get to see your hands or legs. If that's true, which doesn't really sound like it, what happens if you do? I didn't see them in this specific dream, but regardless. Thanks!

Anyway, I remember that I was on my roof probably just sunbathing when I noticed a family below entering my yard and stealing my things. It was weird because they were stealing things of no value to me such as rubbish and glass bottles. 


I proceed to talk to them asking them politely what they were doing and I told them If they asked me nicely  I would be ok with them taking those things. The family consisting of a father a mother and a small child , they were aware of my presence but continued to go through my things. I remember asking them multiple times for them to just ask and id be ok with them taking that stuff because I didn't really mind and I wanted to help them. 

They were now inside my house just observing it and looking through my things, I had this feeling that they were very interested in me suddenly and my goals and aspirations. They remarked how I wanted to be famous and were very interested, They started looking through my personal possessions that I had sentimental value too like my art and journal where I write everything. During this time they were also just running around the house still stealing things like socks ?? I kept on telling them to stop and if they asked they could have these small things I didn't care about.

 I offered to make the food because I thought they must be hungry and poor that's why they are stealing from me. I just wanna say during this whole time I was very calm and I actually wanted to help them. Things started to take a turn, I sensed that they were very interested in my knowledge I had acquired, specifically occult knowledge. I remember then that I and the mother had a deep and personal conversation, I remember I was staring very deeply into her eyes, we were both trying to figure out the other person, I got the feeling she was very intelligent and was much smarter than the Father. Her eyes had no pupils and were basically just the iris. Very very mysterious and beautiful eyes. 


Anyway, after this, I left them alone to maybe get something from another room, when I returned and the family was together, the father had my kitchen knife and he was pointing it at me. 

I started to get very very angry. I told them to get the fuck out of my house I then stood up to Father as he had the knife pointing at my chest I stared into his eyes. Suddenly everything goes crazy the energy changes I feel extremely powerful, I start to communicate through staring into his eyes that I was going to kill him. His face suddenly dropped and his face showed pure fear. I was feeling extremely powerful after his face dropped magical energy came out of me that destroyed him and threw him and his family out of my house. The end of the dream.  I remember thinking that a demon was helping me get them out. Because the energy I felt was not from me, neither was the thought of wanting to kill him, it was like i was taking a backseat to what was happening.

This dream was very very detailed including small talk with the family that I chose to not include since it wasn't that interesting. The feeling I had when I was staring into the fathers' eyes was like nothing I've ever experienced in my life before. ",hot,Demonic energy helped me take control.,8.0

I'm in a haunted house, an old, dimly lit, dirty, abandoned looking one. I usually start in the basement and slowly work my way up. There is a ghost/spirit thing that looks a person with tattered clothes and long dark hair. The head is usually down and they don't appear solid and clear, it looks like a possesed spirit. I don't interact directly with the spirit, it's almost like I'm walking though the house reliving someone else's memories. 

The first part in the basement there is a small boy who is getting abused by the spirit. As I make my way through the steps up the levels of the house, when I get near the spirit it tries to keep me from passing. 

At the top of the steps there is a long dark scary hallway.

When I dreamt it last night, for a change I was pretty aware that I was dreaming, which is why I remember the dream so vividly now. So I tried to force my way through the dream because I knew I couldn't be harmed. But I was still terrified while doing so. When I got to the top, I recognized the dark hallway from my Aunt's house when I was really young. I always thought it was scary as a kid because it was long and dark.

I was in a classroom with a teacher and a bunch of students. The teacher was a small middle aged woman who looked a lot younger than she really was. Short black hair with bangs and bug eyes. Think ""Kate Micucci"". I feel like I've known her before, but from where I don't remember. The vibe she gave off was one of paranoia and uncertainty. She tried to act commanding and confident in front of the class, but unsuccessfully. Her lecture wasn't grasping everyones attention like she had hoped it would and this just made her seem more unsure of herself. I took out my phone and started playing music from it. She didn't say anything about it at first. The volume of the music was somewhat low so it was a little hard to tell where the noise was coming from. Realizing this, I stealthily pinned it on other peoples desks who were close in proximity to me, maybe thinking they'd get the blame if she decided to say something about it. Soon after, she stopped, and in a tone of annoyance said ""Where is that noise coming from?"" I had my phone on the persons desk behind me, and as she was about to get upset with that person, I fessed up and admitted that I was the culprit. I don't think I confessed out of guilt, but rather because I didn't care about the consequences. I was a snarky ***hole in this dream and idk why. She decided to discipline me in kind of a weird way by deciding to cut all of my long hair off in front of the class. Maybe she thought it was humiliating for me, idk. Not caring, I just said 'ok'. She seemed surprised by my lack of resistance. She sat me down in a barber chair that came out of nowhere and wrapped this bandanna thing around my head, half covering the top half of my eyes as to keep me from getting hair in them. I suddenly remember feeling my scalp being massaged with warm water and shampoo. It felt really nice and I didn't want it to end. She then cut my hair and it was a nice experience. When she finished she put up a small mirror in front of my face for me to see the end result. It didn't look bad at all, not amazingly professional, but not bad. I was happy with it and told her as much. My praise and thanks took her off guard. She looked flustered but happy with my reaction. She asked me if I wanted to see it in a bigger mirror and I enthusiastically said yes. She told me to hang on, then she walked over behind her desks and brought up this hidden keypad that she had in one of her books. She typed in a 4 digit code and the bookshelf on the wall opened up. It revealed a hidden room with a mirror on the floor, slightly angled towards us like an adjustable drawing table would be. I thought it was odd but didn't question it. When I walked in I figured that whatever she had in here was probably personal, so I made an effort to keep my eyes dead set on the mirror and not let them wander anywhere else. I got a better look at myself and she apologized for the mirror being on the floor instead of the wall. As I looked in the mirror I was too distracted by letting her know not to worry about it, and wondering about what else she could have in this room, to pay enough attention to how I looked. Though I'm sure I still looked good. I walked out and thanked her and she seemed happy. Somewhere in this dream I had been texting with friends to make plans to go to the movies later on. When I realized I was late, I gave her a hug and told her thank you again. She hugged me back and seemed touched by the gesture. I left, and when I was walking down the hallway I noticed some stray hairs on my shoulders. I may or may not have wiped them off, I don't remember. That's where it ended.

Maybe part of why I was acting out was so that I would be sent out of the classroom because I wanted to watch the movie with my friends earlier. Idk though. I don't know why I acted the way I did in this dream. I felt more aware of how I was being in the latter half when I wasn't annoying her. 

Extra: There was one point, I'm not sure when, where she started playing her own music from her phone. Maybe it was to counteract my music, or maybe it wasn't until after she cut my hair. All I remember is her playing ""Ocean Man"", (""that song from Shrek""), and admiring it. She was telling one of the other students why it was brilliant. I don't remember exactly how she described the song, but she used a lot of big words and musical lingo, and I wondered if they were even real and if she actually knew what she was talking about or not.

So here is how my dream went....

My brother, mom and I were in a house doing our own thing. He was playing games and our mom was doing laundry and such. I was just walking around the house...? Now my mom in the dream was not in real physical appearance to my mom in real life. She was hot as fuck....but I felt like she was my mom so I didn't have extreme weird feelings towards her. I just recognized like ""Man....this lady is fucking hot but she's my mom right?""

She decides to take a shower with the door open and when done... stepped out and started drying off and I kept awkwardly walking back and forth past the bathroom glancing...at her ass and such when I went to hang out with my bro in his room which was nearby lol. So we start playing some console game (can't remember what kind) and the doorbell rings....

Apparently, I am to tutor some senior high school girl. For some reason I am to tutor her in my brothers room in which case he leaves....my mom turns on some music while she folds clothes or whatever lol. The girl and I enter his room and close the door. We start talking about her assignments and such but then start talking about life...I felt like I was at the age I am now...with almost a decade on her. I started making her laugh...she made me laugh...a real good time. Strange enough we start flirting with each other...now let me say this now...

This high school girl/woman looked like she could of been in college. Her face and body, personality....everything about her was fucking ideal to me. In real life I would probably change my life for the better if I could have her... So in the midst of flirting I remembered I'm supposed to be tutoring this girl so I told her to hold on while I get some papers from my room. I go to my room  and while picking up the papers...started thinking about working out again...getting a good job...getting my own place all sorts of shit. I quite literally thought that I wanted to be some sort of man to take care of a wife and kids. It was odd as fuck since that is NOTHING like me in real life. Wife...Kids...Everything, Shit even A Girlfriend Is Nowhere On My Fucking Radar....hasn't been in over 12 years.

So...I come back to the room and we try to continue talking about the assignments but it's hard? I can't focus and neither can she it seems? The sexual tension for some reason was heavy as fuck. Then I said something like ""We're not going to be able to focus right now huh? We might as well just fuck...and do this afterwards.""...the high school girl was like...so into the fucking idea. She was so excited and asked me if she could use my shower. I Then thought ""What the fuck am I doing? I'm going to fuck this girl I'm supposed to tutor while my mom and brother are in the house?"" I leave the room while she's in the shower to go talk to my mom. I tell her whats up...but she already knew. She said she sent my brother outside a while ago and turned the music on so she couldn't hear what was going on while she watched a show on t.v.

She then told me that I better not have feelings towards the girl...I lied and told her I was just going to have a bit of fun.

I go back to my brothers room and wait. She enters the room a few minutes later and closes the door. Standing there in her panties and this little white shirt...I was hit with almost a frenzy feeling. This girl was so fucking delicious looking I almost felt like my sanity switch was about to be flipped off. FROM TOP TO BOTTOM PURE FUCKING PERFECTION. Then I was quite literally thinking in the dream ""OMG I want this chick to come here a second time but If I have full blown sex with her...she might not come back! Fuck!"" So I decided upon oral...without me even saying anything she got on the bed on all fours...she was so fucking happy/excited/sexy looking...even her fucking voice holy shit...thinking about it while typing this is wild. So I get on the bed behind her and slide her panties down...and I think I started drooling LMAO! I told her ""I'm going to eat out your ass and pussy...and how about next time...we fuck like animals?"" She agreed!...I placed my hands on that plump...soft and smooth ass...and spread her cheeks and...I started eating this chicks ass out (I feel like I should of started with the pussy but her asshole was just so damn alluring..) and she started moaning and FUUUUUUCCCKKKK!!!! I lost my mind and BAM! I fucking woke up...with my tongue sticking out licking my pillow LMAO!

When I woke up I was begging to jump back into the dream and finish...sometimes I can drift back into a dream but not today...not now...not when I REALLY WANT TO.

I always think in my dreams but this dream was one of the more, sort of lucid dreams I've had in a while....I felt like I had some sort of control of my thoughts and actions.

&#x200B;

Some background:

I'm from Finland, 19, male, graduated high school, got university on hold as I'm currently training to be a reserve officer in the army. I recently led a 14-week project with \~40 employees to produce a book of sorts, all the while undergoing military training, so that might be a source of stress, as I'm still fixing parts of the book. There are other things that might be useful for interpreting, but I'll leave those for PMs if somebody is willing to tackle this dream.

&#x200B;

Now, in the actual dream I'm leading a larger-scale project similar to the real life one (down to the office layout with slight changes in size and arrangement). I ""know"" just about all of the people I'm working with. Everything is going smoothly. The setting, though ominous, doesn't concern me in the dream; the office is located in a mall-like structure, and in the middle, between escalators, are our living quarters' lockers (identical to the ones in the army). They are surrounded with black, engraved stones I never bothered reading in the dream, as I was in a constant hurry to reach interviews and the office.

&#x200B;

One day in the dream I had a meta-dream of sorts. I recall seeing a little girl live her life with her parents. This is where the dream gets darker and more confusing. The family ends up murdered; not much else is clear from the dream, apart from a happy jingle linked with the parents and some screams.

&#x200B;

Upon waking up pretty unshaken, I head for the office. Grabbing things from my locker, I notice some of the engraved stones have shifted from their pedestals, now uncentered. Paying it no mind (not like my real self, a perfectionist) I go to work. That day a little boy appeared to give his input on the project. That was pretty normal, as we had a lot of different interviewees. The boy was later revealed to have some knowledge of the girl in my dream, though.

&#x200B;

This marked the beginning of the confusing part. I start seeing vivid apparitions of the girl appearing around corners I turn or right behind me in the office. They disappear when acknowledged, fading away with a sound from the meta-dream. Each apparition lasts longer than the last.

&#x200B;

The next day, the girl doesn't disappear. Instead, she sprints away with a look of amusement on her face. If I lose sight of her, I find a note in the place she ran to. Upon cornering her, she hands me the notes and disappears. The notes in question are neatly printed on thick, coated paper. They have an orange lining and black text, making them easy to notice around the office. However, when I begin reading them, they too disappear after a while. They're written in some sort of cipher, presumably Caesar. I want to write a note down as I read it, as to not lose the gibberish and try to decode some of it. To my surprise, nobody in the office obeys me even though they all acknowledged me as their leader. They also do not see the notes or the girl or know anything about her. For some reason I don't want the girl to disappear (a strong feeling of sadness overcomes me when she does).

&#x200B;

At this point they think (and maybe me too, in the dream) that I'm losing my sanity. The dream ends with me placing the notepads I ordered to be placed around the office for writing down the notes myself.

&#x200B;

The office, mall and all places with interviews were well lit and relaxed spaces. The dream is not really a nightmare, but it did leave me rattled. Writing this, I felt the same sadness for the girl as in the dream even though I know that she never even was real (a figment from a dream wihtin a dream, even).",hot,I dont't usually dream,2.0
0.0,ap32qk,0.0,1.0,"The dream started pretty realistically. Nothing special was happening, just me doing chores around the house and my family watching TV and eating dinner. Then I started feeling kind of uneasy, as if I had felt something was wrong, but nobody was saying a thing. My best friend was also in the house and doing literally nothing, just standing there. In the evening, my mom approached me and just said that she will be gone by the end of the week, acting like it was no big deal. It sounded like she scheduled her own death, that's how sure she was of her end on Tuesday. Almost immediately, tears came running down my cheeks, I was sobbing and hugging her and broke down, pretty much. My mom was very chill about it the entire time. Then I realized that all of the other family members knew before I did, even my younger sister. They were all informed about this in advance, even my best friend knew and I got so mad that they didn't tell me. I remember thinking how could you have not told me that this could be the last movie we watch together, or the last dinner we cook together etc. I was so mad and broken during the following week I just wanted to hug her and cherish her while she was still here. I remember I had so much to study for school and for some reason this was more important than my dying mother, and I had to devote a couple of hours to books, but felt extremely guilty about it. I just knew I had to do it somehow. The dream ended with no dramatic end or anything, just faded away and I woke up.

A bit of back story: I'm a female high school student. I do think this dream has some correlation with my mother's health in real life. Last December she was hospitalized and diagnosed with two serious autoimmune diseases. She started therapy and came back home with a lot of restrictions. She can't be in a room with more than 5 people in it, because of the risk of catching an infection or a simple cold, which would have severe consequences for her. So she's not allowed to go to work for at least half a year now, until some progress is made. She also has to be warm all the time, can't leave the house, can't do any physical work. In the beginning, this obviously left a significant impact on the entire household, but now we are kind of used to it.

I have a recurring... plot in similar setting. I've been having variations of this dream for my whole adult life, maybe earlier.

I'm in a huge building with lots and lots of hallways and staircases. A tall building like a hotel but it barely has any rooms. I also know in these dreams that this is the site of some huge busy event like a wedding, or it's a giant school campus or theme park outside this building. I am aware that there are a ton of people I know, and I'm supposed to be involved in this event or location in some way and this is the most vivid part: I know that a lot of people are there expecting me to come outside/downstairs to be a part of the activities and for no discernible reason I'm terrified of doing so. I run through the building, taking dark hallways and staircases as fast as I can trying to lose the people. They aren't chasing me menacingly, nobody even knows where I am. They're just casually looking around for me. They only want to find me so that I can be social or whatever. There's no reason for me to be so terrified of being found but it's the most important feeling in the world. Once I feel like I'm in a place where I won't be found, I sit down and feel intense relief and the dream ends. I'm usually in a dark staircase when I sit down. Sometimes like a weird carpeted attic space.

I especially want help decoding this next part:

The last time I had the dream, it was different. I was going to visit a friend at work and as I approached the building he was working in, I realized it was again a version of the building in this recurring dream. I went inside, same place but no feeling of threat. I knew it was only full of strangers, so nobody could be expecting anything from me, so I wasn't scared at all. I knew he was busy and he'd make his way to me if I just asked someone for him and then waited. I asked a young guy to go let my friend know I was there. His reaction was ""He's going to be REALLY happy you made it"". I waited downstairs, on the floor I'm usually running away from, the busy and well-lit lobby. I found myself chatting with strangers and not caring about much of anything. Finally my friend came to get me. I was so happy to see him. He grabbed my hand and led me across the floor until we got to a staircase leading DOWN this time even though I knew we were on the bottom floor, this led to like a secret room where a bunch of his friends were hanging out. (I'm always running upstairs in the scary version). So my friend lets go of my hand once we get to this staircase and asks me to sit down and wait, he runs off again. He was very busy and important in this place but very happy. I sat and the dream ended. No feeling of relief this time because there hadn't been any fear.

I was moving into an apartment with my mother, aunts, grandmother, my neighbors grandmother, basically every older lady in my life.  I was walking around, helping people move, etc. I had a conversation with my grandmother and when we walked by her room there was someone in her bed.  I didn’t recognize this person, but my grandmother instantly recognized this person as her own grandmother.  So we’re both freaking out cuz we live in a haunted house apparently, and she addresses the ghost. The ghost looks at her and yells “Grandmother!” in Czech.  She got up from bed and ran at us with her arm reached out.  I couldn’t tell what the ghost’s intentions were, and both of us quickly moved out of the way.  She bolted straight past us, toppling over a banister and disappearing.  Comical, yet terrifying.

This isn’t super important, but it puzzled me, because this grandmother is Swedish, and I had to look it up to identify that it was Czech that the ghost was speaking.  I speak Russian so I knew it was some sort of Slavic variant, and I’m part Czech, but this wasn’t a word I knew because I don’t have a family member who uses that title.  I was in a house with my mormors, babcias and everyone else under the sun, but the family member I would most associate with that title wasn’t in my dream at all.

So anyways, I ran to the kitchen and wrote it all down, running to tell my mom that she got us a haunted house.  She didn’t listen to a word I said and thought that what I wrote down was a grocery list.  After several interrupted attempts at explaining, she showed me that everyone was crowded around another room.  I ran there and my perspective shifted from first person to third person like a movie camera.

There was an older woman who I didn’t recognize as a family member, but this was her room in our apartment and she was seeing ghosts as well.  This ghost was a young man from the 1970’s.  She addressed him, asking if his name was Timothy Wells.  It was apparent that this ghost was her, she was trans and this was a vision of her dead self, which she addressed with her dead name.  It became clear to me that what she was addressing was a demon taking on the form of her dead self, as it reacted incredibly violently.  My family crowded around her to comfort her as the demon’s eyes rolled back into his head and he took an aggressive stance, shouting horrible things about how she was going to hell for being trans.  I’m non-binary, so that made me incredibly angry, so angry that I woke up from my dream just before I could tell it off.  After I woke up, for my own emotional sake, I had to imagine exorcising the shit out of that thing.

So my question is, what does this all mean?  Do I have some sort of inner turmoil that I have to deal with?  Is it trying to give me insight on my relationships with these people in waking life?  I don’t know why I can’t interpret my dreams like I used to, I feel like I can identify all the important symbols but there’s just too many specificities and I can’t find any meaning within them and it’s incredibly frustrating.

Anyone feel like helping me out?

I was with an old friend of mine walking through a city until we reached an industrial part. We got up a roof and could see from far away. There i was looking at a specific building and i had the memory that we once stole stuff from there. I reminded him about it.

Then, in a flash I was there, 
it was now nightime and we jumped the fence and everything I would see is like I saw it for a second time. The alleys, the countainers, I knew where we were in the compound and how it was designed. I would see people running sneakily around with masks at multiple area while I was just walking around. 

(Now that I think about it, this flash was probably the memory of us stealing stuff in the area and we must have been the people I saw all around the compound)

Then again, in a flash, I was back on the roof far away with my friend in the middle of the day.

We get down the roof and walk up a street, we are now in residential area with big houses and large land. We see a house and enter by a window. I was in a room with carpet floor, blue walls and two ladders. I went up a ladder and a door was locked. I lockpicked it and opened it. There was a very small room with a window and lots of sunlight. There were chests and cases all filled with expensive jewelry. I was grabbing everything and heard a sound downstairs. I go down the ladder and see an old lady come ( i do not know her) she's clearly shocked to see me and my friend and has an heart attack. 

(At this point I start waking up a little bit but stay in the dream)

It started with me and my fiance on our way to the city I lived in in Japan. We were getting off the train late at night. As we exited, the location marquee glowed strikingly bright red with the phrase ""火事場"" (Kajiba) which I understood in the dream to be the town's name. In reality it simply is The Scene Of A Fire. 

From there we were going to get on a bus, but we were running late and watched the last bus leave without us. I asked a station attendant if there was maybe a nice hotel here in Kajiba City. I actually physically asked her out loud and woke myself up for a moment, but fell back asleep quickly. She asked me to speak quietly and gave us a phone number. When called it only played an unsettling and somber song. We couldn't listen to it long because it was upsetting for some reason, like something we shouldn't be hearing. There was a voice singing, though it wasn't in Japanese or English or any language that I recognized. It was more like a cry or wail. We were scared to call back so instead we left the station to see if we couldn't just find an inn nearby.

We found what seemed to have been an old inn at one point but now it was just a dilapidated and crumbling building. There were people there but no one would speak to us, look at us, or move from behind piles of rubble. I tried speaking to them to ask directions but they only stared past me. My fiance was nervous to be there and urged us to go back to the station, so we left. 

On the way back we passed a peculiar road accident. A bed in pristine condition sat in the center of the road with a car, smoking and crumpled against it. There was a man sleeping peacefully there, entirely unbothered by the blaring horn and flickering streetlight. We stopped to wonder but as we watched, an emergency vehicle pulled up aside the bed and before they could even get out to attend the crash, their own car crunched against the bed like a magnet pulled it. My fiance pulled me away, afraid of what had happened. I kept looking back, at a loss.

We made our way back to the station, deciding to stay there until the morning. We sat against a brick wall and as we fell asleep leaning on each others shoulders I woke up.

So the dream starts off with me and my dad driving through my apartment complex. Here we come across a group of stray dogs, there were about 20 of them. So I get out of the car to try and help find some of the owners. Every dog had a collar and a leash, all the dogs come up to me and start jumping on me and kissing me and want to play, but I pick out a German Shepherd (I’ve always loved German Shepherds but have never owned one). He had on a blue collar and a black leash, a blue bone name tag that said “By Chance”. So I start calling the dog Chance and try to find his owner. We’re walking around the apartment complex and end up at our lake house (a place my dog really loved), and w go to one of my favorite restaurants and to the beach, but I can’t find his owner. Everywhere we went though people would say “There’s Chance”, but no one knew the owner. So we go to a restaurant cause I started to get hungry, I tried tying him up outside to go in and eat, but never thought it would work, I didn’t want someone to take him or for him to run away. While I’m in there a bunch of police come in because there was a high speed chase going on and that’s where they were gonna stop the guy. So I go out to protect “Chance”. They stop him and I ask some of the officers if they knew anything about the owner and eventually one says yes and is excited that they found the dog and took him. 

So the night of the dream, my dog was fine, and she was healthy. We went on a 2 mile walk and she ate all her food. Fast forward to that morning, my dog got sick and threw up. We didn’t think anything about it at the time, cause it was just once. Well we came back that night after going out and she wasn’t doing well, so we took her to the emergency vet, after examining her the doctor working said that he can’t say for sure, but it is MOST likely a cancer mass in her stomach, saying it’s about 95% likely. Given her age it wouldn’t make sense to operate or do chemo. The doctor comes back and says that the X-ray to determine it would cost $1,500, and euthanasia would be $75. $1,500 is a lot of money to spend, considering there’s a 95% chance you’ll put your dog down regardless. So the tests come back and it’s the best case scenario, it’s the dog equivalent of appendicitis. So they operate on her, another $4,500, and she couldn’t fully recover from it, and we had to put her down.

I apologize and we went to go to the room to play. As we played we slid down the room, it was snowing so we decided to go sledding, onto a near by hill of snow. This took us to a little shed in the backyard. I went to the shed to go grab something as the girl went back to the house. When I was looking around the shed I heard a meow. I followed the sound to a large container. Inside the container was a bunch of animals! Rats, mice, kittens, a few puppies, and baby rabbits. They all looked okay at first but as I started to investigate them more I noticed that they were all in very bad condition. The were infested with fleas, ticks, I even notice someone of them were dead and the other animals were feeding off of them to keep from starving. Of course I was frightened but I have this habit of not being able to be fully scared or scream in a dream. In a way I just quietly panic. As I was panicking and trying to separate the still living animals in a different container I began to notice that the blood was still wet and that a lot of the animal corpses were decapitated. I don’t remember what happen after this but I remember so desperately trying to help the still live animals. After this I woke up.

0.0,anvel2,2.0,4.0,"About me: 28 year old white male with lower middle class upbringing mom struggled with money growing up, filed for bankruptcy and occasionally, our power and water would be shut off from lack of payment of bills. I now live comfortably with a stable job, two college degrees, a fiancé, a cat, and a dog in a nice apartment just outside the city. Personality type is ENTJ. 

I had a dream last night that really stuck with me. Most of the time I have a hard time remembering my dreams, but this one hasn’t faded in to obscurity like most of them do.

Background related to the dream: my family has a farm outside the city where I spend a significant amount of time. It’s nice, secluded, and very peaceful. I also hunt there, not for sport, but as a means of providing food for my family and in an effort to curb our consumption of processes meats.

The dream:

I’m in the back pasture of my farm in a field where I regularly hunt. It’s early afternoon and the first thing I notice is it seems to be overgrown, but not sinisterly so. The woods have come further in than once they were, but it’s still recognizably my back pasture. In addition to the woods growing up, the wild grasses have grown taller and there is a mixture of garden vegetables growing where they should not be.

 In the center of it all stands a stag. The stag has large misshapen antlers, what hunter’s would typically “non typical” in growth, this meaning they aren’t symmetrical and have an uneven number of tines on each antler. Additionally, this stag is a deep emerald green and appears to be in pain. It’s flesh is rotted away and his skull is exposed, but partially covered by flesh and fur. There is a large hole in his side and his ribs are exposed.

My dream self recognizes that this animal must be in extreme pain and that it would be merciful to end its life. I take aim with my gun and shoot it three times. Nothing happens. The deer then charges and I grab it by the antlers. We fight for what seems like hours and then the stag turns and runs away. Through out the entirety of our fight I never felt fear. In fact, I felt no fear throughout the entirety of the dream. What I felt was peace. There was no feeling of malice from the deer either, just a battling of wills that was never fully resolved.

I’m curious to see if anyone else could shed some light on what this could possibly mean.",hot,Attacked by a stag,4.0

I know some stuff from life is creeping into my dreams but this morning was pretty bad. I've been struggling financially more than I ever have in life. I have all these advanced degrees (2 Masters) and somehow have been unable to get a job for the last year. It's definitely to the point that bills are being skipped and stuff is being turned off. I'm normally optimistic and hopeful about life but this situation has tested my faith in ways I never thought it would. 

Last night I dreamt I started robbing people. My neighbor gave me money to pay an important bill for them while they were away, and it was related to his daughter who was sick and needed treatment that their insurance wouldn't pay. He had somehow got the money and it was a lot. Instead I took the money and paid off bills I owed. Then I broke into people's car to start stealing stuff to sell it, and the dream basically ended with me robbing people at GUNPOINT to give me their wallets or else. In the last one I told the guy, who was an older gentleman ""I will kill you and I @#$%\*+ mean it. Give me the #$%\^ money now. Ain't asking again.""

That is not me. Not me at all. I don't even cuss irl, have never held a firearm and quite literally stole money from a baby while threatening murder.  It's left me pretty shaken up still some 6 hours later. That is not me. Or is it that that IS me and I can be desperate to the point that I would start hurting people to survive?

0.0,anssd2,10.0,2.0,"Relevant ""back story"": I woke up this morning at 4:30 to drive my husband to work and my son to daycare. When I got home, I thought I could get a quick nap before an appointment I had today at 12:30 p.m.

I was driving back home from dropping everyone off and decided I wasn't tired enough, so I got back into my car and went back out driving again. Next thing I remember, I was waking up in an intersection. Apparently, I fell asleep in the street. I woke up still groggy, and decided to get somewhere safe to get off the road and crash. I pulled into what seemed to be an office building, struggled to get up a flight of stairs, and passed out in a bathroom. I woke up again, panties and shorts around my ankles, as if I had used the restroom before I slept. People began to come in, so I took off my panties, pulled up my shorts, adjusted myself, and walked out to get in my car and drive, as I felt way better. Where there was a stairway coming in, there was now an abstract staircase being used as a game by a class of Japanese kids in uniform. Some steps were steeper than others, some deeply steep, some average height and they tapered down into a point towards the door. I made my way down, and the children encouraged me as I went down. When I hit the door, they wished me on my way. I stepped outside into the bright sunlight and made my way to my car. Everything went dark and I woke up in a bed in a basement. It was raining outside and I was with a young man, about the age of seventeen, black hair, sparse facial hair, average build, and acne. He was a stranger, but for some reason, I knew his name was Ethan, a friend of my husband's nephew, which is odd because my husband's nephew has a friend named Ethan. I felt drugged, like I was slipped Xanax or Klonopin. I felt sleepy-groggy again, yet high at the same time. I was naked and so was Ethan and we were lying on the mattress, and he was putting the moves on me. I knew I was married and I didn't want to cheat on my husband, but I couldn't stop him from sliding in my butt. I remember he said, ""boy oh boy"" in excitement (major turn off). I wanted to stop him, I didn't enjoy it, but I couldn't stop him. He then pulled out, and wiped his dick off, telling me that he knew not to ""double dip"" (pet peeve). As he wiped his dick off, I looked at the window and noticed that it was raining inside the basement. I got up to close it and noticed that I was in the basement of a school and I could see up into the parking lot. I remembered my car and that if I was parked in the back of a school, I more than likely could be towed. I told Ethan that I needed to get my car so it wouldn't be towed. Ethan said, ""You're mental delusions are manifesting themselves. Calm down"". He shut the window and proceeded to climb on top of me and enter me vaginally. I couldn't stop it, and it didn't feel good; All I could think about was what my husband and what would happen to my marriage if and when he found out. Next I remember, my husband, a strange female, and Leonardo DiCaprio were in the basement with me and Leonardo was threatening to tell my husband about my encounter with Ethan. I started talking about him, ripping him about the grays in his beard, and that's the comment that set him off and he told my husband that I had slept with Ethan. When my husband asked who Ethan was, Leonardo mentioned that he was friends with two other people, one of which was named ""Sweet Pea"", a male, that my husband claimed he knew. My husband began to take off his wedding ring, and I got up and tried to stop him and explain my case. I don't remember what exactly what I said, but I know that whatever I was saying, didn't really matter to my husband in the slightest. I caught a glance out of the window and saw it was late at night. The moon was out. I instantly remembered the car, then realized I couldn't have driven there in my car, having been in a fender bender two days ago (real time). I had borrowed my roommate's car, which could've been towed. I abandoned the conversation with my husband, and ran outside in a t-shirt without panties and ran all around the parking lot. I clearly was at a school, but like a high school. There were kids showing up for band practice, there was an orchestra event going on that seemed to be coinciding with a wedding held in the school. I ran in the school, and saw it was late enough for administrators to be locking up their offices and leaving for the day. I ran through this door, that exit, everywhere throughout that school. I remember the school building being huge, almost as big as a cathedral. I saw the front of the school was the same place with the abstract staircase I saw the children in uniform playing earlier in the daytime, which is odd because this wasn't a private school, but a public school. While I was running all over the school and the parking lot(s), I had the key fob to my roommate's car, pressing it like mad, desperate to hear the beeping to find his car. I heard nothing. As I began to realize my husband might be leaving me and I just got my roommate's car towed accidentally, I go into a severe panic attack. I notice my husband sitting outside a shack across the street from the school, smoking a cigarette. I run my way over there, screaming and hollering for help and run into Snoop Dogg and Shaquille O'Neal clearly engaging in a drug deal. I scream and beg them to help me, and they both look at me oddly, and said they couldn't do anything for me and walked away. I ran over to my husband who immediately asked me, ""Did you get \[friend's\] car towed?"" I replied truthfully. As I saw tears well up in his eyes, he threw my hands off of him and simply said, ""Fuck you"". I begged him not to leave me, in a school parking lot, in a t-shirt with no panties, and no way to get home, and no one able to help me. He then asked me if the friend's car took a trip to the fucking moon. 

I forced myself to wake up. After lying in bed for a minute, I asked my husband to call me on break and explained this to him. That's when I broke into the real panic attack.

0.0,anq3hk,2.0,2.0,"I didn’t know whether to flair this as nightmare or reoccurring. Anyways. My school class and I along with everyone’s parents were at a wedding or something. Then, I go outside, from the back door that’s through the kitchen, when I come back. It changes into this nightmare which is extremely realistic and terrifying to me. I can say I’ve experienced this second half of the dream about 3-4 times and that’s just the ones I remember. Mind you Im also a little mad since there was a bit of action between me and my crush during the dinner of the wedding. So, this nightmare is me, in my house, in my bedroom with my sibilants, I decide to leave my bedroom and go to the hallway right outside, which is a long corridor that connects to doors from the left to right. I always end up going and finding a tall standing Erie monster with a creepy bull mask staring right at me. And somehow delivering a message that within a few days I’d be dead. Run back to the room tell my siblings, they don’t even listen. I try hard to make them see him but he hides. I use my iPhone light throughout this thing but I can only turn up the power of the flashlight to two ticks even though I’m trying to move it up. While I’m scared doing acrobatic maneuvers in my room trying to avoid interaction with him, my dad comes and tells us, bad news and is mad at us and tells us to stay in our place. (Mind you this is all in my house which I thought I was awake every time.) then of course I unwillingly go back to the hallway and see him again hiding right next room staring dead through me. I’m of course still terrified. I just remember going back to my room and the hallway a lot and then I wake up. Right now at 6:30 I didn’t go back to sleep, I wanted to crack down on this issue, since it’s pissing me off having nightmares repeatedly especially ones where I think I’m awake. The rest of the ones it was just slightly different as in the mask would change. And with one I could only use the iPhone display screen light by shining it towards everywhere. I really need help understanding the meaning of this so I can stop it, thanks for reading.

The dream started with me and two of my very close friends riding on a wing of an airplane which flew between every city in my country. By the way, there is only one airport in my country. Anyway, we were having a lot of fun in the air and just talking. We were supposed to jump off whenever we wanted to land, but we couldn't agree where we wanted to go. I was pushing for a small town on the north, my friends wanted to go to the seaside. Eventually, I was too scared to do what I wanted myself so we just jumped and gently landed in a town on the coast.

Almost immediately, we found ourselves in a big car and I was in the driver's seat. I still haven't learned how to drive and in the dream this was accurately represented. I tried to figure out which  foot pedal I was supposed to use for gas and the cars behind us just kept yelling and shouting at us for being so slow. I figured it out and continued driving to the beach where we got out. My friends suddenly disappeared and my sisters and brothers showed up along with my dad.

Me and my siblings found ourselves on some weird bicycles and we went into Chinatown from the beach. The bikes were supposedly designed for performing stunts in the air and we were having a lot of fun. My brother was the only person failing in absolutely everything and we laughed a lot at his unfortunate attempts. In the meantime, dad was following us on foot and I remember suspecting he was cheating on mom then telling that to my sister. We continued riding through the neighbourhood and I noticed dad going into a club of some sort. My siblings all went off into different directions and I decided to follow my dad inside.

As soon as I stepped foot inside, a blonde short-haired girl stopped me and told me one of her friends really liked me and would like me to draw her. In real life, I've recently dedicated more and more time to art and I have drawn a couple of realistic portraits of my friends, so this wasn't a big surprise. Moving on, I agreed and quickly drew a portrait which actually turned out amazing considering it took me around 10 seconds. The girl then thanked me and told me I should go to her house for a drawing session.

I don't know why, but I followed her and found myself outside her house. There were two more girls there and we all just sat in the front yard and started sketching. I was struggling to find focus and inspiration. Across the street there was a dumpster and I wanted to go over there and lay down in front of it and draw. I gave up on the idea because I snapped out of it and saw that it was a very dirty environment. I then leaned onto the car and continued drawing.

All of a sudden, I found myself in a hotel room with 3 more girls. One of them was one of my best friends, a person I love and care about very much. The other girl was an acquaintance with blond hair. The third girl was Asian and I don't know her. We were in a very mediocre hotel room, nothing luxurious or anything, but we were apparently rich. In real life, only the blonde girl is of an above average financial standing. Anyway, we were very rich and these small, ugly rooms we were in were supposed to be very elegant and sophisticated. We were just sitting and chatting, having fun. Then we started thinking about some robberies that have been happening recently. All of our rooms had exits to our own roofs. Since we were in the room of that close friend of mine, we went up to the roof and set up some sound recorders and equipment in case anybody wanted to break in through the roof. We went back into the room and continued talking.

I was standing in the hallway, leaned against the wall. My friend was sitting in a chair besides me, and the two other girls were sitting on a bed near the exit to the roof. Suddenly, my friend heard some noise upstairs and started panicking. A tall, muscled man with a huge bag stormed into the room from the roof. The Asian girl started screaming and immediately ran away. My friend was screaming as well, this was her room. Apparently, the blonde forced me into some sort of a plan she had to rob my friend. I don't remember exactly what it was and I don't think it was explicitly said, I just know I was forced to participate in her betrayal. She started screaming how maybe stealing artworks was my friend's profession which maybe didn't make a lot of sense, but that was a sign.

I threw myself at my friend and lifted her up against the wall. I am stronger than her so I put my hands around her neck in order to get her to lose consciousness. As she was slipping away she couldn't believe I was the person hurting her and she had the most disappointed look on her face. As soon as I knocked her out, I started crying and apologizing and explaining how the other girl forced me to do this. I leaned my head on her chest and started sobbing. I felt her slowly beginning to wake up and I knew what I has to do. I once again, put my hands on her neck and pressed a bit harder until she was unconscious again. I lay my head down on her and hugged her and couldn't stop thinking about what I had just done. I was whispering ""sorry, sorry, sorry, I love you, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry"" and so on. In the background the blonde and the thief were making a chaos and taking everything they found. I was just crying and apologizing and wondering how would I be able to stay friends with her after that.

Then I woke up. If you read this far, thank you! I guess I just want to see if there is some meaning behind this, mostly because I don't see how any part of this dream relates to what is happening in reality. 

I am a female high school student and have such long dreams very often. What was very unusual about this one is that it was very intense in an emotional sense I guess. I just couldn't stop thinking about my friend's face and everything I did.

I recently visited New York for the first time.

My second night in New York I had a dream about a  dead actor (he died before the 60's) out of the blue.

He met me in Times Square, snow was falling, we were the only two around.

He walked up to me, said ""Hi"", smiled, I said Hi and we walked side by side smiling in silence then I woke up.

The next day I recalled the dream vividly and emotionally. It felt very real.

I went on with my day, got on the subway and visited Central Park.

At one point I crossed the street and sat on a random stoop of an old Brownstone building, to look up the nearest coffeeshop directions on my phone to walk to.

&#x200B;

Just then - this actor appeared in my mind again.....it just kind of HIT my thoughts  like a bird on a windshield and I thought, ""What is going on?? Why am I thinking of this actor so much?""

&#x200B;

I got distracted then and instead of looking for a coffeeshop anymore, I typed his name into google.....

I vaguely recalled he used to hang out / live in New York, though he mainly lived in Los Angeles.

&#x200B;

I found an article about an apartment he had in New York, that he went to when he wanted to escape Hollywood, etc.

The address was in the article as fans go and visit it regularly.

&#x200B;

When I typed his old address in, it turned out I was sitting on the stoop of his apartment.

Somehow in my minds eye I know that the boy has been sucked through a tiny wormhole in the luggage bay and is trying to communicate with us to make us aware of the escape route. He does this by playing old pop songs over the intercom and splicing the words together. anyway we queue up to go through this tiny wormhole portal thing, old man and taylor swift go before me. I get sucked through and on the other side I'm in some weird toy town carnival happy land.

I'm just wondering if anyone would be so kind as to help interpret this nightmare that I had last night, which was one of those dreams which linger all day and make you feel like something's watching you behind you're back because it was so terrifying! I'm 28/F/American living in Western EU/INFJ/Neurotic-Openness dominant?? IRL, my husband & I are looking into buying our first house, which I think is relevant to this dream, as I'm very terrified of break-ins and robberies. 

&#x200B;

First, I was in ""Italy,"" flying above a forest & war ruins. It was apparently an extremely cursed place that had a lot of very, very, very, very dark energy emanating from it. This is where the version of my current apartment was. In this dark, dark forest. After having an aerial view of this, I was back home--or at least, a dream version of it.

I was with my husband and there was an intense feeling of distance. He said that he had to go to his hometown, and so went. While he was gone, I went back to my childhood home, where I found his mother smoking a cigarette in my old bedroom. She told me that he had been cheating on me for a while. After that, I was back in the version of my current apartment and was laying down to sleep. Someone started banging on the front door, violently, and for what felt like a super long time. My cat started scratching at the door and screaming, so I tried to calm him without letting the stranger on the other side of the door realize that I was there. The banging eventually subsided and I remembered that someone had been knocking on the front door at random hours of the night for months. My husband eventually came back and the feeling of distance was even stronger. He admitted that he had been cheating on me, and we were talking about what we should do. I wanted to tell him about the stranger, but because of the cheating and emotional distance felt, I didn't want to add another stressful thing to the pile.

That night, again, the banging on the door started. Only this time, I saw the guy driving up to our apartment in a red sports car. My husband was in the other room, and throughout the dream, he was really cold, uncaring, apathetic about everything, so was very uninterested in what I was doing/the stranger. Again, the banging would not stop, and since I had seen the guy and realized that he had been following me for a really long time, I decided I would finally open the door & confront him. When I opened the door, he was wearing all black, and was holding an extremely giant machete. I started panicking as he began to try to attack me. As I was screaming and fighting him, my husband handed me a sword, which I used to split the stranger's head in half. (I can still see the image and ugh, it's sending shivers down my spine omg).

Realizing that I had killed him, I started crying, and freaking out. My husband, meanwhile, seemed to have not been able to care any less. The body of the stranger was laying face down next to its red car. Behind, it was all black forest.

I realized at this point that I would have to call the police. I tried to talk to my husband and get his advice, but he just wasn't interested. Eventually, a neighbor came to visit, and upon seeing the stranger's dead body, she started screaming, and I told my husband to quickly call the cops, so I could tell our neighbor that they were already on their way.

I'm in immigrant IRL and in the dream, this was one of the things that I was so scared about regarding the stranger, because attacking an intruder is a crime where I live. In any case, our neighbor was just losing her mind screaming, so my husband and I decided to get out of there. We started driving to someone's house, and it seemed like the people at the house were somehow related to the stranger. I remember our drive there was extremely dark, and my husband just wanted to practice making U-turns, lol. On our way there, I checked my phone and found that I was added to a group chat called ""Neighbor Murderer,"" which was all the tenets in our building talking about how I had murdered some innocent guy. Eventually, we get to this house, and it's daytime and really, clinic-like bright and sunny. It's a couple with a newborn baby. They're very polite, but cold, and unhappy, but they do let us inside. Once inside, we hear the police sirens, and eventually, the police appear.

I was sitting at a round kitchen table. It was very dark. I felt petrified but hopeful that maybe the police would understand that I was trying to defend myself. I was also really scared because I could tell my husband didn't want to be around me, and was so disinterested in me and the fact he had to put up with my now having killed someone. In any case, he was sitting to my left, and the ""leader"" of the police was sitting across from me. The other police officers were lined up against the wall, barricading the door. The leader started interrogating me by asking questions about whether or not I had killed the stranger. I admitted everything and started crying. The police officer started to ask if whether or not my migrant country had ""treated me right,"" and reminded me of how much the country has provided for me. How could I have killed one of it's real citizens? I remember being really thirsty and asking if I could get up to get a glass of water. The officer said no, and that's when I started to wake up.

It started out quite normal. I was wandering around a country-esque environment looking at nature and the small neighborhoods that were scattered around. A few cars and trucks would drive by on the roads I came across. Nothing out of the ordinary.

I eventually encountered a group of women who just appeared out of the trees suddenly (This dream skipped around a bit and wasn't completely coherent). There was about 4-5 of them who ambushed me. I remember talking to them a bit but not what was said. I ended up being tied up upside down from two poles sticking out of the ground while they performed an odd ritual under a full moon. They then began to feed (draw/suck blood) from my groin area while I hung there. This lasted for a few minutes.

After they were done I was taken down and brought to their home. It looked like a pretty normal country home but was quite large. Each having their own room. They explained to me that I was welcome to come and go as I pleased and had full reign of the house, including them. I could be friends or lovers with any of them. The catch was that I was forced to live there and be used once a year in a feeding ritual.

Usually it involved someone I liked, found attractive or a friend. I was adopted and last summer I found my adoption papers and there are a LOT of hints, quotes from my 5 year old self and suggestions that I had been sexually abused. I know I was physically and emotionally, the papers say my mother didn't defend me from sexual abuse, but they don't say straight up that I was. I do know I was very sexually suggestive and awake (if that makes sense??). I began masturbating without knowing what it was and would touch my underwear often, at the age of 6 or so.
Mostly my dreams would be violent, the other person would be aggressive, make threats or I would cry. There had been times I would masturbate while asleep during these dreams. As I got older I realized what was actually happening in there dreams and I felt immense guilt and shame. At one point I tried to discuss it with a group of friends and one of the people made posts about me online, indirectly talking about how I'm a terrible, disgusting person who romanticizes rape. It had never been like that for me. While awake, I had a lot of fear and was very triggered by rape. I had also been knowingly raped at 8 by my sister but these dreams began before that happened.
I don't have these dreams anymore, but I still feel the shame. I have watched fake- rape porn. Anhthing that feels too real gives me a massive panic attack. It's something that fills me with a lot of shame but I can't control it

&#x200B;

I occasionally have dreams about ex-girlfriends or the ones that slipped away, but aside from a ""woops"" thought in the morning, I don't really remember them. Every few weeks I might get a strong dream where I focus on an ex moving in with me, and the dream moves towards her underwear or her (sexual) actions that make me happy.

&#x200B;

The dream I had last night was especially vivid and I'd like to see what you all think. To preface this, as mentioned I'm a young single guy living alone, but I've just completed a purchase on a large family house. My thought process is that you buy once, you buy forever.

&#x200B;

So, the dream itself consisted of a marriage ceremony to a girl. Interestingly, she actually didn't appear at all in the dream. I'm Asian (brown, short, slight beer belly), but she was white with blonde hair - the physical traits I like from women. She was only mentioned via description, to my closest (male) friends, as she wasn't there yet.

&#x200B;

The ceremony was set in a house that I owned - yet was basically a mansion. My sister was dealing with the PA system, and I called a few songs first, before calling everybody in to welcome the girlfriend (as I called her). The ""everybody"" includes colleagues, friends, family - basically what you'd expect from a proper marriage gig.

&#x200B;

This is where the dream ended as I woke up. I was a little pissed off that I couldn't see the dream to the end, and when I tried to snooze for the next two hours, I only got a dream of a long-forgotten ex giving me a lapdance.

&#x200B;

When I was younger I used to lucid dream very often. I'd be put into a scenario and just work through it. Normally it involved cars, family, or occasionally mixing a (female) partner into one of these. When I had a girlfriend the lucid dreams died off, and I've not had them reappear since.

My personality type is INFP

So I’ve been noticing zombies in my dreams for like 2 weeks now. I haven’t made a conscious attempt at remembering my dreams until about a week ago. I’ll briefly retell the 3 or so dreams I remember pretty vividly.

In the first dream I remember (these zombie dreams had already been happening, this is my first attempt at remembering one) I was in a city, and there was a plague going around. It had to do with anger turning people into zombies. They would get so angry that they would turn into mindless, killing machines. I can’t remember if they were fast or slow zombies. You could turn by getting too angry or being killed by someone who turned. 
This dream was the trippiest. I remember living in a small cottage-like house. Well, I ended up crafting large, wooden legs, like 50 feet high with joints like knees, and attaching them to this house. My house was essentially quadrupedal, and I was on the roof and steering my house with a pirate ship steering wheel. This is how I would travel without being killed by the zombies. 

This dream bled into another one the same night. I was in a fancy hotel, but the rooms were oddly cheap. I found out that the prices were low because my uncle (the person in the dream did not look like my uncle, he looked like Simon from the walking dead https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(The_Walking_Dead)

Well, Simon, my uncle, was unassuming at first, but would chase people away because he was creepy and would turn violent when they refused to keep talking with him or do what he wanted. I confronted him, and he chased me throughout the house with a knife. I forgot how, but I defeated him. The dream was so blissfully lucid after that. I found a part of 3D glasses, and when I wore them, I could bend reality to my will. 

Same night, the dream warped again. There was a child in my grandma’s backyard, but it was like a forest. I was seeing things from 3rd person. The child had been missing, and the locals were looking for him for like a week or something. He was in the backyard looking for baseballs, for some reason they were important enough that he couldn’t leave until he found them. He befriended an animal, might’ve been a tiger. But I know for sure that he found 5 baby tigers who were harmless, but the animal that he befriended killed all of them by biting their heads. The child ended up leaving the backyard, and someone saw him  and told him to come with him. The child said he had to find the baseballs, but the person said they didn’t matter and he had to go now. The child retreated into the forest, and was abducted by aliens. The leader of the aliens was the child, but from a higher dimension. He said ‘this can end however you want, I can change the ending to make it whatever you want.’ The child had a sandwich with only jelly. He asked his future self to put peanut butter on it, and that’s how the dream played out and ended. 

Yesterday night, I had a dream that I was living in a post apocalyptic world. I was with a sizable group, about 20, and we took refuge in a log cabin. Well, they all ended up turning into zombies, and only me and one person in my group were still human. It felt like this other person was my closest friend in the world. We had to kill all of our friends who turned before they bit us, it was very bloody and gory. I remember getting so close to being bit that I felt teeth on my skin, but my friend saved me. We ended up having to bolt out of the cabin, and this is when a hostile group showed up, and we had to hide and flee from them, lest they kill us. 

Many of my hazier dreams include conflicts with people in a zombie infested setting, or running from/killing the zombies themselves. I have yet to become a zombie or see myself as one, though.

Skip this next paragraph if you just want to read the dream, the next paragraph is background. 

It may or may not have something to do with some onset depression I appear to be having (more than usual that is). I have depression and anxiety fueled procrastination issues which keep me from excelling academically and which are slowly eating me up more and more each semester. I'm going to take a break either next semester or the one after that to relax and make up for the sleep I don't get, I'd rather take a semester off than drop out of school. I'm usually okay if I have a break away from things, I feel overstimulated and overpressured when nearly any expectations or deadlines are placed in my path. I end up learning more and feeling extremely motivated when I take online classes via MOOCs and read tons of books and science journals amongst myself outside of school (this was my life before university) and typically come into contact with fewer people in general. Ergo, learning is one of the most meaningful things I can do for myself yet university pressure destroys me. Don't ask me how I expect to be able to work with deadlines in my future career, I've just not figured it out yet. However, I am engaged to a guy who makes a pretty comfortable and stable salary and who has said that he wouldn't care whether I worked or not and that he just wants me to do what I enjoy so if all else fails I'll be okay. I just want to finish my degree both because I'm passionate about the subject and just in case I can get better in the future and put it to use. Another thing which may have to do with this particular dream is that I was in the same situation in real life as I was in the dream when I was 8 (without the drugs which were in the dream) with an older male cousin (who is mentally disabled) and who guilted and threatened me into sleeping in the same bed with him at a sleepover. I don't really have that much closure about it because he isn't right in the head enough to understand the implications of his actions about incest, but he's just cognizant enough to be manipulative to a child at the same time. I haven't thought about the scenario in a while because it was so long ago and I went through couseling as a kid which helped a lot, but I watched The Cowboy with John Wayne the other day and the way that this kid in the movie was manipulated to not tell John Wayne's character about a thief in the movie reminded me of how my cousin coaxed me with nonsensical threats. It put it in my head and now I had this dream. Is it just pure coincidence because I saw the movie or do I need to sort through some stuff? The dream freaked me out because I felt like I was reliving the incident.

So, dream: 

I had to sleep in the same bed with my parents in our camper as we were travelling across the country in the summer and I woke up (in the dream) to my father masturbating in a spooning like position with me, close enough to where he was touching me. I stayed quiet because I didn't know what he'd do if I spoke. The next morning (still in the dream), I got up and I felt drugged. It felt like a really strong drug and I could barely get out full sentences or pay attention to people who talked to me. I managed to asked my mother, ""Did you hear Dad last night?"" and she just shook her head and said ""Well, people kind of have to create fantasies to really get it on."" She brushed it under the rug and the vacation carried out normally, except I could still tell I was still completely high on some kind of hard substance like cocaine or something (I've not had cocaine so I wouldn't know but it was stronger than alcohol) and that it kept me from making too complex of movements like trying to run away into town and call someone to take me home (which I felt I wanted to do).

I wake up and I’m in an eerie vacant house . I’m here to do a specific job. The more I look around the more I found out about myself and my situation. I don’t have an occupation. It’s like this is a random spawn point. I leave the house and wander around the city. Climbing from rooftop to rooftop. It’s really dark and gloomy and always is. The weather stays the exact same with this depressing overcast sky. This place just feels so sad, like there’s almost no hope in this world.   I find my way onto this rooftop, it’s by the sea. One side is the city and the other is a view of a gray beach, lots of rocks. It looked comparable to a uk beach. On the rooftop everyone is describing how thankful they are. I think it was a potluck of some sort. They were praying before they ate. The meal was just dirt with rocks sprinkled on top. It was shaped like food and everyone else was describing its flavor and saying how good it was. It just tasted like dirt to me. While I’m eating, I’m approached by this younger kid who is talking to me about where I’m from and how I got here. He tells me that I’m not alone. No one remembers how they got here. I express to him that I want to leave, he tells me to lower my voice then begins to tell me about this wives tale that there is a way to make the beach light up and fill it with hope. One thing that this world didn’t have. It didn’t make sense at the time so I decide to leave to explore the city. As I’m walking I begin to see everyone doing their job in the city. No one looks even close to happy or content with themselves. I notice we’re all dressed like prisoners. Not black and white stripes or jumpsuits but gray pants and gray thermal shirts. Exactly the same. To keep us from having individuality I guess. No one is happy. In fact everyone looks rather miserable. I come across this huge mansion. I need to find my way out of this place, so I figured spying on the rich would be a good place to start. I begin to sneak through this mansion. As I’m creeping around trying to go undetected I come across this person that I’m stuck in this place with. There’s an unspoken connection. Like maybe it was an old friend, but I couldn’t tell you exactly who. They were all of my friends all at once it felt like. I don’t remember their face distinctly. We pair up and work together to let each other know if there’s guards around. We begin to subdue them one by one, eventually we’re caught and sent to a vocation. Something that the government picks for you to keep you busy. Like that will keep us out of trouble. I think we may have stolen an important object from that mansion. Or we may have stolen it off of a guard. But the object was this wristband, it was small but it was made up entirely of light. My partner carried it. I told him about the wives tale of the ocean being able to open up, you just have to find hope and throw it into the mirky waters. I think the wrist band is the hope. During our vocations we were given jobs we absolutely hated. So as we were working, it fueled the fire for us to leave. There were multiple escape efforts, the only really memorable one was during a marathon they made for people trying to abandon this place by leaving or killing themselves. It was a way of shaming them in front of the public. My friend is just ahead of me during the run, I remember that he still has the wristband. On this one stretch of road it goes from downtown to the edge of the ocean then turns sharply left and stays on the coast. Our plan was for my friend to throw the hope into the sea as soon he hit that corner, and as I got to it. I would dive in with him as the sea was opening up. It didn’t go according to plan the first time. I learned quickly that they had a security guard running behind me to make sure I didn’t pull any funny business. And that body guard was very athletically inclined. He had no problem keeping up with me. The first time my partner jumped in but the sea didn’t open up and the body guard caught me as I was running to jump. They dream then started back at the beginning. I became better and better each time I failed in situations, I learned how to deal with them better. The second time I saw the person ahead of me dive into the dark gray water. This was my last chance, I had to make it into that water or suffer for the rest of my existence. I start to run faster to get rid of the body guard and he is staying right on my heels. I start pulling away and he reaches an arm out to keep me within reach. He misses me and his hand snags on to the back of the neck of my shirt. I shed it as quick as I can while maintaining my speed. Now he just has ahold of the shirt and I’m free. As I make it to the corner I see the gray dark water becoming this clear and vibrant sea. Starting from the coast line, it starts transforming in a single straight line. Like a cloud was being blown out of the area. I become overwhelmed with emotions I’m so proud that I got through that and my heart is beating out of my chest. This is it, I’m free. Free of all of the oppression this life has forced onto me. I feel alive. I leap into the water and find my friends hand. I open my eyes and even see the water changing as I was under it. This wave of warmth engulfs me and makes me feel as safe as I’ve ever been. We did it. We’re out. The picture slowly fades to black.   I wake up. I see a toilet in front of me. And a tool in my hand. Am I in a vocation? Did that really not work?   All I know is that it’s about mid morning. Like I’ve been up for awhile. This world seems different. It wasn’t as melancholy and gray as the old one. Im so afraid to look around. I don’t know if I can be detected or not. I peek out of the bathroom window and into the next window. It’s a sleeping old lady. That doesn’t give me much info. I slowly walk out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. And I am overwhelmed. That’s the only way to describe it. I hear my wife on the phone talking to her mother, she’s laying on the bed and to the right of her is this huge window. Through it I see the most beautiful sunrise I’ve ever witnessed in my entire life. Pink and red and orange with a sparse few blue clouds. I walk in just stammering to myself and stumbling towards the window. I’m in disbelief at the sight of the sun. I feel it’s warmth, like a mother touching her child’s face the morning after a cold front hit. I hear my wife ask me if I fixed the toilet. I begin to cry at the sight of everything through my window. My wife then asks me if everything is alright. I tell her perfect, everything is perfect as I’m still looking through the window almost sobbing at this point. She tells her mom that yes everything is fine and she’ll call her back. I hear her hang up and she makes her way to where she is standing directly behind me. She then slowly wraps her arms around me. I close my eyes, I’m at peace with everything. I’m engulfed in this wave of happiness, it rushes through me and radiates. The dream fades to black and I still feel her warmth. I then become conscious and aware that I’m sleeping.",hot,Lifetimes in Gloom,1.0

Threatened in some why? by these androids controlled by a single conciousness. Like a hivemind, but it wasn't AI, it was something else. Something old that had always been there but had no vessels to act through. All the bodies of these androids were anatomically male, but the heads were the heads of the [Set animal](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_animal). They were very ominous even before turning against humanity, but after they were terrifying. In the dream they didn't actually DO anything but I got the distinct feeling that they intended to even if I didn't see it. The entire dream was tinged in a monochromatic color scheme and the whole setting was a completely industrialized metropolis. It was raining or had recently rained because all the metal was shining and wet. What was really strange (in the dream it was frustrating) was that even though these androids were man made everyone else in the dream seemed completely oblivious to them despite them being everywhere.

it started off somewhere with my mother asking me to go to the pet store and buy her some bugs, and a few snakes. which I did. I came back with a styrofoam container of ""moles"" which looked like fleas, and some other bugs can't remember. the snake I bought was one of those green tree snakes with the wide heads and leafy green color.

I remember the shape of its head very vividly.

irl we have a lot of dogs so it was unusual in the dream when all of them were running free through the house and into my room. but they seemed like they wanted something so I brought a few of them into the kitchen where I discovered my mother started microwaving the animals because it was cold out and she thought it would make them warm.

obviously, I began freaking out and screaming but she didn't understand why what she was doing was bad or wrong. and went about her activity. I retrieved the small styrofoam cup with the green snake, it was all shriveled and looked like a swirled green bean with a big head. that was the most memorable thing, the body of the snake was shriveled and charred on some spots but the head was fine, except it had dead eyes.

I then placed him on the counter to discover many more cups of dead snakes all around. (i think there was at least one dead mouse I'm not sure) she then told me to go to my room and get one of the dogs she could warm them up too. I began yelling and she still didn't understand I went to my room with two of the dogs so I could try to hide them.

she had at some point, released the cup of ""moles"" onto my ceiling which was now also full of cracks that it doesn't have irl. she yelled from the kitchen (we have a small house) that the moles would fix the cracks and let them do as they pleased in my room. some of them then flew down and began crawling all over me and the dogs, and this is where I woke up.

TL;DR: keep on having a reoccurring dream that in back in highschool, failing and disliked by other students. 3 years later, after looking at my transcripts which were actually alright, I had a positive dream about a school reunion where I was finally accepted by my peers.

Real life context: 3 years ago I was very depressed through grade 12 after going through a string of terrible situations (car crash I shouldn't have survived, parents ugly divorce, sexual assault police did nothing about). I skipped all morning classes and maybe we to school 2 afternoons in a week. People stopped talking to me when i was there. Nobody ever reached out to help me. I graduated with mostly 50's I'm my major classes and a 94 in band so I went on to be a musician. To this day, I regret not getting a proper education and feel very guilty about not giving school 100%.

Reoccurring dream: I'm sitting in class, nobody will look or talk to me. It's some kind of math test for either pre-calc or physics (which I never took) so of course I'm bombing it. People keep looking at me and laughing, whispering to the other classmates that I'm totally going to fail. Teacher keeps looking at me unimpressed. The guilt and shame keeps growing until I wake up in a panic.

Real life: I, now 20 years old have started looking into going to university for psychology to hopefully help struggling kids like myself. I was worried I wouldn't have the grades for it and had lost my transcript so I had to order it. I got it a week or so ago and it looks like I actually can squeeze into uni with my grades! A huge weight was lifted when I realized I probably won't have to upgrade my classes! I want to start thinking about settling down with my boyfriend (27) of two years and he's done uni and has a really good job. On some level I always felt that guilt but he's been super supportive in helping me find the right path to a good career.

New dream: I'm back in school and people are laughing again, but this time not at me. It's some kind of reunion and everyone is super nice and chatty with me for the first time. My teacher keeps asking questions about my music career and is actually being supportive of it for the first time. People started actually asking me for advice! It was wholesome and everything I wish school had been.

0.0,altr96,1.0,1.0,"So I don’t dream very often, at least I don’t remember them very often. I tend to sleep like a rock, so it was a little unusual. I used to dream a lot when I was a kid, and I would often have nightmares, but I don’t think I’ve ever experienced anything quite this real or crazy before. I’m not sure if I should explain anything about myself before this, if that will taint the interpretation of the dream if anyone is brave enough to take a stab at it. I will post the initial dream, and then any questions that come up, just let me know!

The dream started with me at a party, I do not know who’s party it was or why I was there.  The girl that I used to be involved with came in with her new boyfriend, she and I are still very close but have not worked out our issues with each other yet. I wanted to leave, but she begged me to stay so I stayed for a while. Finally I got out of the party and went home. I went to sleep and when I woke up I was in my grandmothers house from when I was a kid, she hasn’t live there and many years so it was very strange to be there again. I woke up next to the girl that I used to be involved with, and when I tried to cuddle with her, she told me all I cared about was being physical and left. I went after her, but only found my grandmother who was very disappointed in me for abandoning her in her opinion. I ended up getting away from her and went to the girls apartment to talk to her about our disagreement. When I arrived, her sister (who moved in recently) answered the door and I asked for the other girl. She was very confused and told me that she did not live there, and that she had never lived there. I was very confused at her response and then saw the cat that we used to share, and defiantly told her that she must live there because there is her cat. She told me that that was her cat and that her sister had never lived in the apartment, and had never even lived in the state. I pushed into the apartment and saw that all of her things were gone, and then tried to call her but found her phone number was no longer in my phone. I begin to panic, I was very scared about everything and the fact that I couldn’t find her. I ended up going to a friends house who definitely remembered her living there.  She came with me to confront the sister, only to be convinced by the sister that the girl had never live there. We came back to my apartment to discuss, I was very panicked and then my old ex from years back showed up begging me to take her back. I demanded she leave and ultimately her new boyfriend arrived and tried to fight me as I told them both to leave. During the fight, her parents appeared and told me they were right about me not being good enough for their daughter since I would hurt her new boyfriend this way. Ultimately they disappeared and I was left alone to be panicked about not being able to find the other girl. I was awakened by a phone call and that was it.

I was in a nearby town looking at a sunset and then I fell through the sky into a medieval kingdom with high walls, deep below ground level. 

You could still see the sky, the kingdom was well lit by the sunset, there was a modern swimming pool in view (no idea why), everyone was in Western European medieval clothing, and there were two twins called Iryn and Beryn. 

They had to duel to the death for no reason other than social pressure. In this strange place, whenever twins came of age they had to do this, because there could NEVER be two, one had to be ""the one"" one had to be the superior twin, so when twins came of age they had to duel and the better one would be allowed live. I don't know why whatever society this was, couldn't just let twins co-exist. 

 I remember telling them that it would be okay, for one of them would come out triumphant and the other would feel an air of proudness from beyond the grave. They were so brainwashed, I was and so was everyone else, everyone believed this. 

They had gold armor.

One is easy to interpret- my father, brother, mom, myself and my husband where all in a limo.  My father and brother wore tuxes; my mom and I both in black.  At one point, the limo stops and my father, wordlessly, exits the vehicle.  Not a whole lot to wonder about there. 

But the recent dreams happened to my mom and brother on the same night.  I want to cover my mom's dream, as there is one particular aspect that is unsettling to me.  

In my mom's recent dream, my father is bringing a friend over for dinner (incidentally, this friend passed away over a decade ago and was not a common topic of conversation in the house).  In the dream, my father was very concerned that the house be just right and dinner be wonderful; my mom replied that the house was clean and dinner would be good, but that she ""was not going to go out and spend a lot of money on these people.""

During the course of getting everything ready, a younger version of myself appeared in the dream and complained of hunger. So, my mother prepared me food.  Then my brother saw that I was eating and he, too, demanded food so my mom fed him as well.  After a bit, the dream version of my young self wanted to go to bed, which my mother permitted.  

At this point there was a knock at the door.  My mother went to answer it. And this, THIS, is the part that is unsettling to me.

At the door was not my father and his guests, as my mother assumed it would be.  Rather, there was a small, young girl in a beautiful red dress with white trim.  Her head was down and she asked for me in what my mother described as a very ""small and soft voice.""  When my mother said I was in bed and that the girl should try to come for me another day, the girl disappeared and my mom woke up. 

All of these dreams are very vivid and disturbing to both my mom and brother.  My mom feels my father needs something from the other side and she just wishes he would tell her so that she could do what he needs.  It's heartbreaking for me to watch.  I don't dream of my father at all.

The day previous I discovered information regarding an individual that caused me to lose absolute trust and respect for them. I am worried because from what's been going on and the experiences and my dreams, I'm worried about people in my life because of it. I am Native American, 18, male (important), and im currently seeing doctors about my odd illness. 

This first dream starts out, I'm in my room hanging out with a friend from high school, let's call him Dewey (note it's not his real name. Protecting the innocent here...) and we're talking about his life playing hockey, and he tells me how much he wants me to come to see his game tomorrow, and I'm all for it. Strangely, he's like ""I'm gonna go smoke, I'll be back."" He doesn't smoke, but I think nothing of it. A few minutes go by and I hear a car pull into the driveway, I look out the window to see this magenta car, I immediately go to get him to tell him his ride is here. As I go outside, something happens or another but it's vague and unclear. 

Then the second dream, this is where shit get's really fucked for me personally. I don't know what to make of it since it's happened before. I'm walking around my middle school, looking for something or someone, I look down and see my shirt is partially unbuttoned... and I have breasts; I'm a girl. Again. So I button my shirt hastily, and as I'm rushing around, blonde hair keeps brushing across my face, and I'm convinced as to the fact I am a blonde girl in this dream. I run into a classroom full of kids and I walk around and the teacher, let's call her Stacy, she tells all the kids to Sit down and to pay attention, but she didn't tell me to leave or ask me what's going on. As I walk out of the room, a little kid is in my way but I very politely say ""excuse me"" and I hear my own voice, but I'm not lucid at this point. As I keep going, I open boy's bathroom, and it's like ""Ok yeah nothing in here."" but then as I open the girl's bathroom, I suddenly feel as if I shouldn't be here and I shouldn't be looking inside this room. Inside, there's all these weird machines and pipes, it's really weird because the pipes start spraying water, so I let go of the door and it close slowly. I look to my right down the hall I came from, and there's hundreds of people, people I know, people I don't know. I see my principle first, she asks me ""What're you doing!?"" but I move passed her, pushing through the crowd, seeing kids I recognize, seeing people I remember, seeing people I never met or seen in my life. 

(warning this is where I feel as if something happened to me that I don't understand)

As I'm pushing through the crowd, someone comes up from behind me and wraps their arms around my neck, and starts dragging me. I can feel many sensations and feelings at this moment, my chest is arched out, the shirt half strangles me and crushing my chest (I literally could FEEL my own breasts as if it's like normal or something I don't fuckin know how that works) and weirdly enough, my pants got really tight too, and I felt as if I became lucid or half-awake, because I definitely did not feel as if I had a vagina. I could definitely feel my penis getting squished in the jeans I am wearing in the dream, and my neck hurts so much. My entire body hurts, and as I'm being dragged in a chokehold, I'm let go, then another set of arms grab me and put me in a different choke hold, more painful than before, the person who was choking me first looks like this weird teenager, grinning and laughing but not taunting me or saying anything specific to me that would give me any hints as to who they are. I reach my hands out because I want to hurt this person, I want to grab them and snap their neck (I know the real technique, grip the chin and cheekbone with your nails, and pull) but he just slapped my hands and arms. Before I wake up, I reach my hands over my head and I feel my thumbs plunge into eyeballs, warm yet they feel hard and solid. I wake up and the pain in my neck remains, and it feels as if I'm still dreaming, as I wake up I virtually scream and panic myself to wake up. 

Right now, my neck feels alright and I feel like my dreams last night don't add up with recent events all too much. But then there's the gender dysphoria, which I don't have nor feel, I never desired to be the other gender, but I feel as if I may be connected with someone, a blonde girl, and whoever she is, I've dreamt of being in her shoes before.

At some point I even had to hold a gun against other relatives to get information from them as to where my parents and brother were. I don't think it worked much but reason prevailed. At another part I was aiming a sniper riffle inside my house at my aunt, and when I was to shoot, I'd immediately signal my mother to escape with my brother who I told to hide. I didn't shoot, it just lead to the previous part with gun. There are more things about the dream like exploration and mystery but that's all I remember. I also remember feeling pumped and excited throughout the dream. Even now that I think about it, it excites me, me saving my family or anyone close to me and freeing them and stuff like that.

I was out in a downtown with friends having a grand old time when this guy came up behind me pressing super close to me. I was obviously uncomfortable and am very confrontational so I turned around to curse them out and I noted that it was this guy I knew. This guy likes me irl and I know it and have let him down gently several times but he refused to take a hint irl. The way I speak when I'm drunk can come off as flirty but most people know I'm just good at flattery and only flirt with people I'll never see again. But he's someone I see all the time, maybe he thought me giving him my phone number or Snapchat whatever I gave him was flirting but it wasn't cause he's in my friends friend group and I see them down town all the time.

Anyway, back to the dream, so I turn around and tell him he needs to take a few steps back before I embarrass him and that's when I see the blade he's holding in his right hand. I freeze up and look ahead and my friends have disappeared because we were waiting in line fore drinks and I'm having a hard time thinking about how to handle this. Then I hear him whisper next to my ear, ""You shouldn't have lied to me."" That's when I knew he was about to try to kill me.

Fight or flight kicked in and I ran out of the bar. I'm a really fast running and I never wear heels downtown, so I'm peeling down the street and he's following. The streets are really quiet and there isn't anyone around. I finally think reasonably and run into the nearest bar. Idk why this stands out but there was a song playing with a sick beat like, ""ANIMAL HOUSE, ANIMAL HOUSE, I'm stuck in the animal house"" or something like that. It was a straight bop. (I tried searching for the song but nothing) So I'm screaming and crying to a bouncer to call the police, so much so that I take their phone and call them myself before realising I'd been stabbed where one of my birth marks are on my hip.

What freaks me out is that if he'd stabbed me in a different one, ones a little higher under my arm he could've made me die drowning in my own blood, and or dying from bloodloss.

This might seem a little silly, but these nightmares have plagued me for most of my life.

So ever since the age of 5 to present day, I have gotten these weird nightmares where there's a man dressed as a green elephant (similar to a trick or treat costume, and he stands on two legs and has a trunk but not overly large ears; but also has red eyes and sharp teeth inside his mouth and trunk). The 'man' is stuck in my Aunt's basement, and in the nightmares my Aunt and her kids that live with her try to please the 'man' by feeding me to it, because it can't leave the basement and if they don't it will turn on them.

Most often when I end up in the basement I can't move or turn my head and it's extremely dark, I'm stuck looking at the red eyes of the 'man', who slowly creeps out of the dark and kills me. Sometime though, I can move and try to hide or get out but there is an invisible wall that keeps me in or he always finds me.

The 'man' will sometimes show up in my regular dreams and would come after me. If I ran I would run slowly, If I asked for help no one would believe me and no matter what I did he would always catch me; the only escape is forcing myself to wake up.

The part that bothers me the most is for a few weeks after my Grandpa had died, when I would have these nightmares, after the 'man' would kill me I would end up in this unfamiliar, small room but I knew it was in my Aunt's house. In this room, there are chairs lined up across all four walls and a single tainted window. In the chair directly across from mine was my Grandpa and he would always tell me ""You've finally made it"" or ""Welcome"". In the rest of the chairs are other relatives dead and alive or people I don't recognize, but some chairs are empty; and I would have a feeling that the empty chairs were for other people that would end up in this room. After what seemed like a few minutes, I would wake up.

Also another creepy part, is that in my Grandma's house a few years after my Grandpa had died, I found this toy that looked like the 'man's face'; green skin, trunk and red eyes but no teeth, it was also flat. The toy was home crocheted, so it was probably made by my Grandma and I don't remember seeing it before.

0.0,al6zk9,0.0,2.0,"Hello everyone. This happened Monday morning (between 5am and 7:30am sometime). For background: my husband and I are clean and sober coming up on 5 years in June. We didn’t know each other before we got clean. We have 3 kids together. Also, this will be important later, before I went to rehab I had a blue car which my mom now owns and drives. 

So here it goes, with as much detail as I can remember (I verbally told my mom and husband the dream so I’m pretty sure I remember most of it). Every thing about the dream was life life: smells, touches, etc. 

I pulled into a convenience store parking lot in my current vehicle. I look to my right and I see the blue car with my husband and a girl in it. Apparently, my husband (H) relapsed and started selling drugs. That’s what he was doing in the car with the girl. I approached the car and opened the drivers side door and made him get out of the car. The girl got out and started yelling at me but she faded into the background so I’m not sure what she was yelling. I convinced H to get in my current vehicle so we could get him help. He got out of the car as I’m backing out of the spot, and runs to the blue car. He drops to his knees and a cop comes up and arrested him. Apparently, they’d been watching him for a while. He turned himself in peacefully. 
Next thing I know, I’m at a conference room table with his aunt and a few other family members. I was sobbing and discussing writing to him in prison. But, we’re planning his funeral and everyone’s looking at me with sad faces, like pity. I end up having a flashback in the dream to where he’s on his knees with handcuffs on. The cop runs up behind him and shoots him in the back of the head point blank. He’s dead. 

This is where I wake up in tears, holding our daughter (who was sleeping next to me). My mind wouldn’t “reboot” so to speak. I knew he was alive and well, I even texted him to tell him about the dream while he’s at work. 

Nothing has happened in our life to make me think he’s using again, or even to make me think our marriage is failing. We’re solid, partners, in love, and work every day to have time with each other when the kids are asleep. I’d say, other than not being able to go on date nights as often as we used to, we are beyond solid. 


The fact that I had legit sensory moments (the smell of the food cooking at the store, the sounds of people getting gas, driving, etc, the feel of the car door, the feel of my steering wheel, the chair and table at the conference room, etc) scared me even more. No, I am not pregnant (used to have realistic dreams during pregnancy), and can’t be at all.

The Dream

I am mostly in my normal life in which I am dating my current boyfriend but today I woke up and knew I was pregnant. I went to the drug store and peed in their bathroom and the test came out positive. I had a rush of anxiety but then quickly that feeling was overshadowed by an immense amount of clarity. I am going to have a baby. So I call my boyfriend and tell him the news. He is a bit hysterical and obviously stressed out by the news but again, I am the essence of calm and I talk him through all the good things that will come of it. I am very happy to be having this baby. So somehow time passes by and I am what feels like 3-8 months pregnant (I've never been pregnant so my perspective is very off). I go through the motions of the day and end up calling my friends just to chat. \[Reality moment: One of my friends had an OK pregnancy but she's had a tough go after giving birth. It's all been very hard for her. The other had an awful pregnancy and awful birthing experience and loves her baby now\]. I call these friends and they are asking me about my pregnancy...is it awful? Are you having morning sickness, cravings etc. My answer was no, it's all been pretty easy, I barely even notice. I remember ending the call and knowing I shouldn't have gloated so much. At the time of the call it didn't feel like gloating but after their reactions, I know I had made the wrong call. I guess I was just so excited about how easy it has been. I've made it so far already and haven't even really noticed. How amazing is that? Well the next day I wake up and there is blood in the bed. Not too much, but enough to have me concerned. My belly feels like it's clenching a bit but I wouldn't necessarily say I'm in labor and having contractions. But I decide that I am concerned enough that I am going to walk to the hospital. Walking because I'm so low key (in this dream state). On my way to the hospital I find my uncle's bicycle shoes and bicycle and decide that's how I'm going to finish the rest of my trek on his bike \[disclaimer: I do not have a relationship with this uncle, he is there at social gatherings and I love my two cousins he is the dad of but still, I find it very shocking that he is in my dram\]. I eventually get to the hospital and bring my bike in the elevator, for some reason. In the elevator I start to feel excruciating pain in my abdomen. I think to myself ""I'm going into labor, this is it...but it's too early. OH MY GOD this is too early!! It's happening, I am in major contractions but something is so wrong. Somehow the elevator is the longest in history and I give ""birth"" in the elevator...into my hand. But it is not a baby, it is an egg...a large and cracked egg. It's not cracked all over but yolk is dripping out. The elevator finally opens and I'm screaming at the nurse at the front desk to HELP ME! It is obvious to me that whatever just came out of me is not a baby but it is stillborn nonetheless. The nurse takes the egg from me and there is a wing that pokes its way out of the shell and I feel a little spark of hope. The nurse leaves the waiting room and I am distraught. What was that, and if it is alive, is it still mine??  The nurse comes out and asks me into a room where she tells me that I had a miscarriage months ago and this thing was slowly dying inside of me. As I process, it's obvious she has gone quiet. I notice that this is not out of respect for what I am going through, but there is obviously more. How is there more?? She then pulls out what looks like an X-Ray chart. She then goes on to explain to me that this condition means that I am no longer able to produce children and will be barren for the rest of my life.

0.0,al3fol,0.0,1.0," The story I'm going to tell you happened to me last night and was one of the weirdest things I've experienced so far, but turned out to be very interesting. I wasn't sure about posting it here but I think it's the place with the best community for it.

Do you know that feeling when you're not asleep but you're not completely awake either? This is where it took place.

So, when I was in this ""dream state"", I started having what were somewhat hallucinations. I'm not certain of their order, but one of the firsts was a simple dream. I was leaving school with one of my regular friends, when two girls suddenly get in my front and don't let me go through. That was when I realized they were actually two old friends I hadn't spoke in some years. I thought it was weird dreaming about that (yes, I was lucid during it, I have lucid dreams pretty regularly), but nothing to alarm about.

Now, this is when the weird part comes. For some context, I'm very familiar with the sound of my mouse clicks, since I'm a regular gamer. So... A lot of times, when I'm falling asleep (specially in the winter), I tend to put my hand in my genitals (we all do it, let's just admit it). A bit after the last dream (note that I don't recall the timelines very well) I start somewhat ""clicking"" with my right hand in my balls, like a computer mouse (I have no idea why, seriously). But that's not the weirdest part, the weirdest was when I actually started hearing the clicks, exactly the way I hear them when I'm playing video-games.After sometime of ""clicking"" I finally understood that that made zero sense, since I was still aware that I was in bed, and that was when I realized where my hand actually was and everything stopped (the noise first and then the will to try it again).

By now you're probably thinking this is some insane shit and laughing your ass's off, but wait for it, because I haven't talked about the title yet. After I recovered from the ""mouse incident"" and tried to fall asleep again, I started thinking about random things and stuff that's annoying me in my life (which I do pretty normally and some of you probably relate). I don't remember what I was thinking about but I know it was gradual until what I'm going to tell you happened. As I was getting deeper in my thoughts I noticed that I was hallucinating but I didn't react, so I kept going (remember that I'm, once again, in the sleep-no sleep zone), and I started to hear more and more voices in my head, and it was becoming worse the more I thought about it, until I thought I was having a schizophrenic atack (I don't have schizophrenia, but at the time I thought I was having my first). However, when I was just about to scream for help, I understood that I wasn't awake and it was all probably a dream/hallucination, and that was when I suddenly opened my eyes and took a DEEP deep breath. Just like that all the voices stopped, for my own sake.

After this happened, it's no surprise I lost all my will to sleep. After a while I googled *""dreaming about being schizophrenic""*and found a website saying this might happen if you're very confused and uncertain, which made a lot of sense given my current situation (I'm not going to talk about it, maybe for another post).

*From here, I'll explain to you why this experience turned out to be good and interesting (you can stop reading if you don't care):*

After I woke up, I reflected about it for around thirty minutes and something felt strangely good. All my ideas were making sense and I seemed very willing to solve my personal problems. Right after my ""atack"", I was obviously extremely scared, but at the same time I noticed a difference in the conscience that was with me. That was not the same confused and messy conscience I'd been with in the last months, that was the conscience I recognize from my childhood and pre-teen years. I know it sounds extremely weird, but it felt like a long-time reunion and it was extremely satisfying, it was like I found myself out of nothing, something I didn't know I was missing.

It was extremely good knowing that I'm still in here, since I've been feeling numb, confused and with no idea of what to do with life (own and love lives), and I felt complete for a moment. This made me realize that, to have somewhat of a meaning in my life, I need to love myself instead of waiting for someone to do it (something I'd been told before), something that now looks way more possible. Yes, I still want someone important in my life, but now I think I understand that that is an extra in life and shouldn't always be my priority, as I've been doing in my past months, and getting frustrated over it, which was driving me mad.

I also realized that I have to focus and be determined in the things I like doing, instead of doing it for the sake of doing or delaying it (school or hobbies), which was one of my best qualities I've been loosing recently.

So this why I said this fucked up experience turned out to be good for me. Just think about it, did my brain, after it was clear that I couldn't get out of this ""pit"" on my own, create this hallucination to shuffle my ideas and make me see my life in the right perspective? That would be simply AMAZING and showed me how little I know about my own body.

TL;DR: I started having hallucinations/lucid dreams while I was falling asleep. I thought I was clicking my mouse and I was hearing the exact sound, when I was actually with my hand in my balls. After that, I got extremely confused while thinking about my problems, which lead me to have somewhat of a schizophrenic atack in my own dream (I'm not actual schizophrenic). I finally realized I wasn't awake, opened my eyes and took a big breath, and all the voices were gone.This made me find some solutions about my own life and my search for meaning, which you can read up there.",hot,I posted this a while ago but I found this sub today.

It showed the young cast pissed they had been ordered to get jobs by their parents. One of the group, a boy who looked kinda like an amalgamation of Archie & Jughead from Riverdale applied to McDonald’s. 

It then cut to a dream sequence where he was naked in the parking lot of one of the restaurants at night, woken up from sleep by Ronald McDonald who’s face contorts and who’s voice becomes demonic.

It then showed them naked from the chest up standing next to each other in front of a station wagon parked at a gas station I know in real life.

Then it cut to one of the girls from the cast, she was apparently in a baseball stadium, Richard Attenborough narrated like in Trespasser: Jurassic Park, talking about how her father was the best video game designer in the world until his death, and that she could never see his final creation.

Then her father starts narrating in the voice of Raymundo from Rocket Power “Dinosaurs playing baseball, it’s the best thing I could think of. That’s why I put it in the demo, but YOU’LL never get to see it!” 

It then shows her staring horrified at a metal door while you hear a sports announcer describing several dinosaur species beginning a game of football, not baseball.

Dream starts off, I'm in first person view and I'm in the woods. I'm walking and this wolf is playing with this stuffed doll, it comes to me and tosses the doll in the air, wagging it's tail. I pick up the doll and toss it into the air and the wolf catches it with ease, this goes on for a few minutes, and I throw it from over my back a good distance. I'm turned around and there's a building, so I go inside.

I go inside, my brother is there, and this Japanese man who's checking in like it's a hotel, it looks like a hotel but more homely. My brother brings me to his room and we hang out, he shows me a cool shirt he got, it's a wolf on the front, and tells me ""you look at it at certain angles and it changes."" And as I move to look at it, the wolf changes to this reptile like creature; almost looks like a really colorful Water Monitor, then it changes a third time into this blue creature that is completely almost alien... Unrecognizable to my knowledge.

I leave and see the very reptile in the homely lobby... It's holding the stuffed doll in its jaws, and drops it (it's how I knew it was a singular creature, like the wolf morphed or something)  and it hopped on this couch. I petted it and it seemed so docile and kind, affectionate even. I get curious about the stuffed doll, so I examine it and it's like a Caroline doll (I don't know what it's actually called). I look back at the couch and the creature is gone.

(Warning this is where shit hits the fan. Also, perspectives change and I realize something.)

I'm walking around with this Caroline doll trying to find this creature, I'm climbing stairs, knocking on hotel room doors, all don't even answer the knocks. Then, I see a door ajar, so I walk in. It's the Japanese Man's room, and the alien looking creature (third form?) Is holding it's unrealistic claws to the man's throat. The creature scurries off so fast I don't even see where it goes. But it's claw detached and grips his throat the point he starts bleeding. I try and pry it off, and it breaks apart successfully and I apply pressure to his neck wound, trying to stop the bleeding. It's bad. Really bad. I wake up at that point and I couldn't help remembering this for how odd and scary this whole thing got, it seemed so innocent at first... Literally harmless, I could've been in that Japanese Man's position TWICE, but what's weird is that even as a wolf it looked odd, it was small, but not dog-like, very much a wolf. The second phase was purely a water monitor with green and blue and red scales, it was beautiful. The third phase, was like if the Monitor's snout fell off, and the scales on it's neck were big scale-like plates, solid blue. I realized that I was someone else again, a blond person, and the perspectives changed to viewing me from the side as I stand over this poor Japanese man as he bleeds out, I'm holding his neck, and my face emotes absolute terror and I feel as if there is something more to all this.",hot,Strange creature and an awfully terrible situation (Help interpret?),1.0

Her speech (which I unfortunately don't remember much of) was basically about money and perfection, a combination of financial advice and chastising the audience about their failures to overcome their problems, so that she could position herself as the rightful giver of advice. I was pretty incensed at her behavior. 

I knew from the newspapers that she was a lesbian serial killer who targeted women, particularly women she seduced but then looked down upon as weak for succumbing. I also remembered from an earlier interaction with her that women would be better with money if they stopped buying makeup. I related this to two of my friends in the audience who were sitting next to each other (a man to my left and a woman to my right), and they were both pretty disgusted, moreso at the latter comment than the serial killer part, which they already seemed to know about. The older woman started to approach our end of the circle to challenge us, but I wasn't intimidated by her at all - I just laughed and left the room. Fin. ",hot,Speech from a serial killer,1.0

My family and friends mean everything to me.   This is a long post; please read the entire post if you have the time since it has all the details, but if you are pressed for time, there is a TL;DR at the bottom.  Here is the dream:

&#x200B;

The first part of the dream was very disturbing and graphic, so I don't want to go into that right now.  I actually might post about it in detail some other time because it's quite serious and has been bothering me and I'd like an interpretation, but it's very very horrific because it relates to the possibility of something catastrophic happening in real life when I was a child.  

&#x200B;

Anyway, for the purposes of this post, what happened in my dream was that God was showing me a memory that I had forgotten.  In real life, I have little to no memory whatsoever of my childhood until about age 13.  The amount of memory loss I have for that time is abnormal.  Anyway, back to the dream.  In this dream, I was watching a forgotten memory.   In the dream memory, I was friends with several children at an arts and crafts type camp.  We were all around 5 to maybe 6 years old.  I was brutally tortured along with the other children there.  For a long time.  All the children died.  I was the only survivor.

&#x200B;

Now, to the part I would like interpreted:

&#x200B;

After being shown that dream memory, God took me to a room.  The room was very bright and shining white.  It was like a Heaven gate.  Like a room where there are portals or openings to Heaven or something.  Not the actual gates in Heaven, just something that would send you there.

&#x200B;

The room had 3 openings covered by curtains.  The curtains were covering up door-like openings, but there was no door; just curtains covering up the openings.   Two openings were on opposite sides of the room.  These were small curtain-covered openings about the size of a normal door.  A third opening was in the center of the room.  It was very large.  About 3 to 5 times as wide as the other openings.  The height was a bit taller than the others.  I think the curtains were red, but this is the only part of the dream I'm not completely sure about.  I walked across the shining room of white and meekly pulled back one of the curtains slightly.  Behind the curtain were several children.  About 15 to 20 children.  They were bright white and looked like regular people in every way but they were shining white and spirit like.  Without having to look, I could sense that there were about 15 to 20 dead children's spirits behind the other small curtained opening, as well.  

&#x200B;

They were kind of crammed together behind the opening like they all wanted to see me.  They were very happy.  They were incredibly happy.  Like they had been enjoying the infinite happiness of Heaven for a long time.  These were the children that had been tortured with me at that camp many many years ago.   They had come to see me, but never went past the curtains.  They never even touched the curtains.  I feel they were not allowed to at that time.  But they told me they loved me and that they were so excited for the day that I would come join them.  During that time, I felt such a strong bond with them, like they were my younger brothers and sisters.  Honestly, I still feel that strong bond even now in waking life.

&#x200B;

Now, I turned and faced the large covered opening.  This opening was covered completely with curtains as the smaller ones were.  But there were no spirits behind the curtains.  I was shown in my mind what was behind these curtains.  It was Heaven, just like the place the children were sitting, but another beautiful area of it.   I was told the reason no one was behind this curtain was because this was the curtain I was to pull aside to enter Heaven for good.  This was my entrance to Heaven.  I asked God if it was my time to go, and I was about to grab the curtain and push it aside to enter.  God said that it was not my time yet;  I wasn't finished on Earth yet.

&#x200B;

My question that I really would appreciate an answer for is the following:

&#x200B;

why was my opening to Heaven so large?  I know for a fact that God was doing this on purpose for some reason.  He deliberately pointed it out to me in the dream, but did not tell me the answer why.   He made the openings for the children very small for the large number of children, but my entrance was very large for just one person.  I don't understand why that was the case.  Please tell me your interpretations and ideas on why it was like this.  Any interpretations are welcome to any part of this dream, but this is what I most want to know.  Thank you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**

Had a dream that God showed me a forgotten memory where me and about 40 children were tortured at a place that masqueraded as an arts and crafts camp; I was the only survivor; later in the dream I went to a gate of Heaven with 3-curtain covered entrances; the children who died were behind the 2 small entrances; They were happy to see me and excited for me to be with them in heaven.  I had a very large entrance God said would be my entrance to Heaven when it was time to go.   The children's entrance was very small for so many people, and my entrance was very large for just one person.  Why was my entrance so large?  God deliberately pointed this out to me in the dream.

I then had a feeling that something was wrong. I kept trying to justify why I didn’t get my paycheck. I ultimately knew that the cops were after me. I ran to my dad’s house and on the way a cop drove past and said something out the window to me that confirmed my theory about the cops coming after me.

I have my own theories on what it meant, but maybe someone else can shed some light or direct me to any kind of similar experience? It's going to be a long post. 

I was about 22 when I broke up with my boyfriend of two years, the first man I truly loved in a healthy way. I was extremely depressed at the time and didn't leave the house for a couple of months. One night during this time, I had a dream. 

I was exploring what seemed like a college campus. At some point I found the library--it was a large open building full of art exhibits. In the middle of the library was a native American small canoe, painted red with some native American art on the bottom. It wasn't in a case, just on display on a stand, and its oar lay neatly inside it. I left the library and explored the campus some more: at the very end of one unkept section of the campus were a line of connected booths, almost like what you would see at a fair, except built from concrete. They were all seemingly abandoned, unused for a long time. The very last booth had a long, skinny, horizontal wooden sign over the top of it, which was askew and kind of dangling at one corner. I stood on the booth to fix the sign, and it came right off--revealing an opening behind it. I could stick my head through the opening and saw a sewer ran directly behind the booths. To the right, the sewer continued into an exit hole with light streaming through. I felt a need to see where the source of the light came from.

It occurred to me that the canoe from the library would fit into this hole above the booth. I returned to the library, found a back door and stuck a thin book into it so that it wouldn't lock. Then I waited for the library to close, and returned at night. The book worked, the door was open, and I walked into the library and lifted the canoe off the stand. I carried it through the main doors and walked it over to the booth at the far end of campus. I lifted it above my head and pushed it through the hole: perfect fit. 

I paddled the canoe through the sewer, and to my surprise, found that the sewer opened up into a tropical, undiscovered paradise, turning into a small river that snaked through a lush rainforest. I can still hear the birds singing. I followed the river through smooth turns and overhanging trees, feeling an overwhelming sense of calm and serenity. Eventually, I found it was a loop: the river brought me back to the other end of the sewer, where I climbed out of the canoe, lifted it back through the hole, replaced the wooden sign, and returned the canoe to its stand in the library. Then I woke up.

When I woke up, I still felt that peaceful feeling. Like I was wrapped in warmth and comfort, and everything would be ok. I know it sounds crazy but that feeling helped me out of my depression.

For the next year or so, I visited that place regularly in my dreams, sometimes multiple times a week.  The odd thing though, is that sometimes there would be a security guard patrolling the library or the booth, and I wouldn't be able to take the canoe into the sewer. Every time I had the dream and successfully made the river journey, I woke up with the same sense of calm. When the security guard was there, I would instead wake up sad or frustrated that I wasn't able to go to my river. I never saw anyone else there, and somehow I intuitively knew I was the only one who knew it existed.

After having this recurring dream for about a year, I met a man named Tom in real life. We began casually dating, and I started to like him a lot. One night, I had the dream, and he was in it. I excitedly brought him through the motions and took him down the river with me. He was awestruck by my paradise and I was so happy to finally be able to share it with someone. I woke up and told him about it. 

The very next night, I had the dream again, only I was alone. This time, as I was going down the river, I saw a figure standing on the riverbank up ahead. Curious, surprised, nervous, I paddled toward him. I had never seen anyone there before. As I got closer, I saw he was wearing what looked like a ranger uniform and hat, but all cream colored. Even closer, I could see his face. It was terrifying: cold and angry. He shook his head slowly and said, ""you shouldn't have brought him here."" And then he turned and disappeared into the jungle. It chilled me and I immediately woke up, alarmed and desperate. It was the first time I had the dream and didn't ""finish"" it--I never got to put the canoe back.

My ex cheated on me and sometimes neglected me but the next week would show affection and it was a constant thing until he broke up with me telling me he loved me but wasn’t ready for a relationship. Month later I found out it was because he fucked another girl and cheated on me and one of the reasons were I didn’t want to have sex until later into the relationship. During the relationship I would go to his best friend and rant to him, cry to him, or just complain about my ex. 

Okay let’s get into dream. 

I had a dream that I stupidly invited my ex over and he randomly invited his best friend over, without asking my permission. His best friend held me down and raped me aggressively as my ex watched, encouraging him. After that event in the dream they somehow were around my school (in real life they go to different high schools) like ALWAYS around... I felt taunted. All I wanted was to avoid them and not see them. After school I was about to confess to one of my best friend the events until I saw them walk up to it table and sat down, one of them whispered in my ear telling me that they would kill me if I told a soul. 

Later on in the dream I find out my Facebook was hacked, never found out who was the culprit but I assumed it was those two. They would post inappropriate videos and pictures of random girls and I felt helpless and distraught. I felt as if my life was slowly going downhill. 

I felt like my ex felt like he was the shit, that he was the one with the power and I wasn’t. I felt helpless and it just seemed that all the power and confidence I had depleted. Before I actually fully got help and talked to an adult, I woke up.

I do remember wondering if I could use it to call and talk to my mom who died in June of 2009 though (my mom did actually die then, not just part of the dream). Everyone seemed to accept this matriarch thing as their ruler. It would from time to time demand human sacrifice, and in my dream my step mom and dad sacrificed two of my sisters to it.

I think i know what it means, but im not entirely sure and would like some other opinions. I wanted to write some background to why i think this person is my twin flame just so i dont seem delusional or crazy or naive or something. Idk if thats the correct label, but either way i've had highly ""coincidental"" and synchronous experiences leading me to believe this person is connected to me in some way. 

&#x200B;

I've had some crazy experiences tell me this girl i havent met irl is my twin flame. I read about twin souls in a book written in 1986 that was about a kid going on adventures with an ET who looked like a human boy. The author had had both a near death experience and a ufo sighting in the same spot years apart, and after one or the other he wrote the book in 3 days flat. It only takes about three afternoons to read, and everything in it matches up with my understanding of whats going on on earth and what the nature of reality is. The only concept in the book i had never heard of was an ultimate soulmate created with you as a gift and reflection of the nature of reality as unconditional love and pure joy. I had been deep into a very bad relationship and so i had been thinking a lot about dreams i had had as a kid and teenager where i was in love with this girl. I was upset that id never find that, and then i read this book and it made me recall the dreams so i started to believe that i actually have a twin flame.

&#x200B;

Well, shortly after i started believing that i started having dreams and literal waking dreams with this mystery woman. In one i woke up in the morning but still was in a semi-dream state, almost like dreaming with your eyes open but youre aware that youre in your room and arent in some other plane, and there was this woman whos energy was very high and ""vibrate-y"" who was laying there lovingly caressing me. 

&#x200B;

Aside from a few other dreams my ex, whose always seen spirits and whose dad and paternal grandmother saw spirits, literally woke up and saw a girl floating above me looking down at me whose description matches perfectly with the girl i came across online. Had a premonition of finding this girl exactly the way i did and exactly one week later. 

&#x200B;

Ok enough background. So this dream i had was one where i walked past a house and saw a grey alien looking person sitting on a couch. I went and was hanging out with people when ms TF girl texts me asking me to come over to her house. I ride a push scooter over there which i found kind of funny when i woke up and thought about it. I arrive at the house and it was actually one i used to live in so i just walk right in. 

&#x200B;

I walk into the living room and knock on the walls as i do so she knew i was there. I tell her im sorry if i scared her and that i just walked in because i used to live there. It was a nice old brick house with high ceilings by the way. Not too old and not too big, but definitely cozy and comfortable. 

&#x200B;

I go and sit next to her on the couch. We greet and shake hands and she says ""My name is earthbeargaia"" and I asked what it was again and she said ""im eartherasky"" or something. I said ""i thought it was 'hernameirl'?"" She responded saying ""Thats just my temporary name"" or her earth name or physical name i couldnt remember it was almost telepathic when she said that. 

&#x200B;

This next part is what was strange. I look into her eyes and she has these huge like ceramic pottery discs covering her eyeballs with these large dark brown or black almond shaped eyes painted onto them. There were glittery sparkles on them like she had decorated them that way. They were maybe 3-4 inches in diameter. I say to her ""didnt i see you in here earlier?"" referring to the alien i saw through the window and then i woke up.

&#x200B;

Im aware that some people on earth are ETs incarnate. That, or they've had past lives some time as other species. What im not sure of is if this dream was actually coming from her higher self, or if it was from some entity that wanted to help me out in some way. Idk i mean if it was some other entity, then it was definitely like they wanted me to pursue this relationship with this girl, but i feel rather cheated to know that it was not actually her in some way. When i was next to her it felt very loving and great and all that, but i know that ETs can make you feel whatever they want you to basically. Im apt to believe its her higher self reminding me of our multidimensional nature and that i shouldnt be looking at her human faults so much, and that i should be thinking about it all from a greater perspective. 

&#x200B;

After i fell asleep again i had more dreams involving her as more of a human, but they werent as clear or memorable.

Any thoughts or intuitive responses would be appreciated :) Sorry that this was kind of a long post .

I was trying to tie a knot around it to make them stay and don’t escape, but I couldn’t. The bag began to break. I freaked out and felt helpless, disgusted and desperate. The maggots got wings and started to fly out from the bag. I remember at this point i was like ”oh... i better just surrender and let them be”. When all of them had been flying out I saw that there was a dead cat in the plastic bag i was holding. 
Then i woke up.

I think the maggots represents my emotions.
Emotions I try to ignore and push down (me trying to tie that knot on the bag, but it just breaks). 
Feelings I don’t want to feel. Emotions I don’t surrender to or accept. They show themselves even if I try to push it down and ignore them. I know they will only grow stonger the longer I hold on to.

0.0,ajy2d3,1.0,3.0,"I remember dreaming that I am a girl. I feel around 18 years old. Based on what happened before which I forgot, I have the striking urge to escape the reality that I hate. I travel to a small bedroom where I see one twin bed located to the far left once I walk inside a door that is placed opposite on the far right. The walls of this room are all wooden and painted white. As I walk to lie down on the bed, I see a shelf with a VCR in front of me. One boy, about 12 years old, sees me distressed. I tell him that I want to escape reality. Then I see him smile and tell me he also does. He tells me he escapes reality by dreaming. I know how to dream, yet for some reason I need his help to reach that point. He volunteers to help me. 

Suddenly he leaves for the hallway through the opposite side of the door that I just came in. I see a middle-aged man, having no idea how he came inside the room. He stands by my side as he helps me dream. Together, I begin to picture a scene from *A Goofy Movie*. I fall out of sleep and return to see the man, who tells me to try again. For the second time, I fall asleep and see the scene from *A Goofy Movie*. 

I teleport to a parallel universe. I'm in the same room, but the boy and man aren't there. *A Goofy Movie* still is playing in that parallel VCR set. Additionally, some new women are conversing with each other in the background. I fix my eyes on *A Goofy Movie* and notice several errors: I haven’t seen Goofy in a single scene, and it says 3 hours remain in the movie while I finished 1 hour. The second error irritates me because I know the movie is shorter than 4 hours. I fix my eyes on the television again as I try to find out what is wrong.

My dream changes again as I watch *A Goofy Movie*. It begins as I see nothing but the movie scene, until I can feel myself again as I fly into the scene. I hear a 2000s pop song’s guitar and female voice as I fly into what no longer is *A Goofy Movie*. I fly into the downstairs portion of my old house. It’s nighttime so I see the lights turned on.

So I was studying something in China, and this woman offered to let me stay with her since I didnt know anyone, so i stayed with her, she was a shop owner and lived at her shop, the downstairs was her little business and upstairs was her living area, she was an older woman but not by too much, any way, one of the men who worked for her, she didnt like him at all so she wanted to kill him, I dont know why I agreed to help, but I did, I dont remember how we got this man down, but this scene was like, me, the woman, some other dude, and they guy we were about to kill, the other two were holding him down and they wanted me to kill him,the only weapon we had was a metal bar, but the woman was like ""oh wait"" and she stuck a spike under the mans head and then told me to continue, so I beat him. They held him down while I beat this man with a pipe, when I was beating his head because there was a spike, the spike went through his head, I just kept hitting him, then I went to his neck and it looked like it was getting flat, at this point the dead guys head was turned to the side,and the other man that was there said ""you gotta hit him on his jaw"" and I said ""it's not as easy as it looks"" so then I gave the pipe to him and he just went berserk on this guys head. I remember snapping out of it and looking around and at my hands and body, how small shards of bone were everywhere,like small glass shards, just everywhere, all over me all over everyone else, when we were all finally done we were talking about how we were going to like, clean this up and get away with it, and I realized theres no way we would be able to get away with it because this man worked for the woman, and she would probably be the first one questioned, anyway when we're about to start, we here a siren, not a police siren but a loud booming siren meant for a lot of people to hear, and I remember looking at the woman, it was a chemical gas attack and we didnt have anywhere to go or anything we couldnt go outside because we were covered in blood so we all huddled up him her bathtub and I remember seeing the chemicals seeping into the air from under the door and the increasing panic of realizing theres no way to escape, we all cover our nose and mouths with our shirts and I closed my eyes, felt the burn of the chemicals, then I woke up

I dont know what it means... 

What's even worse is that this morning i had a lot of weird dreams. I woke up in what i think was my grade school best friends room, bunk bed and all, and was looking for something. I was trying to type ""tightrope greatest show"" into Spotify on my phone as i looked and couldn't type it correctly but i could see all of the letters.

I woke up again and i can't remember what room it was. I think it was the room I'm in now. I got up and got ready for school with no issues. I opened the garage door and saw my bike in the driveway flipped over with the seat in a bucket of water. I took it out and sat down only to realize that i wasn't in my neighborhood. I was in a completely different place with a completely different house. I got freaked out and rode away. I ended up walking in this underground sewage or storm drain place and my boyfriend shouted at me to use my ""cheats"" so i did? I shrunk myself down and was able to keep my dog from attacking me.

0.0,ajaxlc,0.0,1.0,"I want to preface that I’m a college student right now and I also work during the summer. I just woke up from this dream so it’s really fresh. 

I don’t remember how the dream started, I just remember when it started to get scary. Mainly, I was in a school with narrow and windy hallways. The walls were white concrete like the high school I went to years ago. It was a labyrinth just to find my class. 
When I sit down, a lot of my co-workers and friends are in this class. In fact, one of my bosses is the professor. I don’t remember anything about the class. 

My teacher steps out for awhile and me and my friends just start goofing off a little. Then the ghost appears. She stands menacingly in the center of the class. It’s very obviously a female. She’s a young white woman, with black bobbed hair, and brown eyes, wearing a white long sleeve shirt with small black horizontal stripes, and black skinny jeans. She’s also skinny, not malnourished but just lanky and she’s around my hight so she’s short (I’m 5’3”-4”). I didn’t notice if she was wearing shoes or not, I only looked into her face when I saw her. She looked like a normal person, except she always looks angry. 

Suddenly she grabs one of my friends and holders her in the air by her throat and tries to choke her out. I’m very protective of my friends so my first instinct was to fight her. I push her away from her and my friend is released, but I don’t stop. I punch and kick this thing like a maniac, even after it disappears. We all then baby my friend afterwards to make sure she’s ok. She’s fine, just scared. 

I think the ghost sees me as a threat now so from here on out, it only targets me. The teacher comes back to lecture and every so often my stuff would fly off my desk or it would take my phone off of vibrate when I got a message. It was very distracting. 

The class ends and we all head out but as I’m walking down the hall with my backpack, I realize I forgot my stuff. This is kind of weird because I’m wearing a backpack, but I feel like I’m missing my supplies. I go back to the classroom, but it’s locked, empty, and the room is dark on the inside. I don’t give up though, I hunt down my professor in the crowded hallway and he gives me the key. 

I go in and turn the lights on and quickly run to my stuff. What’s now interesting is the backpack I was wearing is no longer on me and my computer case I bring to my college classes and my cellphone with the case I currently have on it is what I forgot. My phone blew up while I was away from it and I had a lot of text notifications. I didn’t stop to look at them though, I knew the ghost was probably watching me so i quickly grabbed my stuff and ran out, turning the lights off behind me and quickly shutting the door. 

After I shut the door though, there was a bang. The Ghost tried to get me on my way out but was too late and slammed into the closed door. She stared at me angrily as I locked the door. I was afraid while I was locking it cuz she was freaking me out. I was shaking and I was trying to hurry because I thought she was going to open the door but she didn’t even try, she just intimidated me. After the door was locked she took a step back into the darkness and disappeared. 

I quickly went to my next class. I couldn’t return the key because the professor had to leave (which is significant because my boss got transferred and is no longer my boss, which is kinda sad because he was really cool). The next professor (which I don’t recognize) tells us that class for tomorrow is going to be cancelled because there’s going to be a huge storm and they predict tornadoes and hail. Thats when I wake up. 

What seems weird about the ghost is that I don’t recognize her as someone in real life, so she has to represent something. The friend she attacked was someone I was close to in high school and I’m still friends with today. I feel like the part where I forgot my stuff was a transition of sorts because I went from feeling like it was high school to feeling like I was in college. Beyond that, I can’t connect any dots.

Basically, the dream started with me walking down a moonlit dirt road. The area was swampy with tall reeds growing all about, they were much taller than I was. I didn't feel cold but I was wearing long sleeved sweater of some kind. After a while of walking down this winding path, it almost felt like I was in a corn maze of sorts. Eventually I came across a large cargo van that had run off the road. The hazard lights were flashing and the headlights were slowly starting to sink into the muddy bank of a pond. Thrown about the wreckage were about 12-16 people all of Chinese/South East Asian decent, they seemed to all be families with children of varying ages. (I only specify Chinese because my ""dream brain"" heard words that I understood to be mandarin.) Anywho, everyone is in shock and only just starting to pull themselves from the ground if they can. I go over to one man and begin to help him up since he was cradling an infant in his arms. I start trying to communicate with him but he's pretty dazed and very scared. The baby he's holding starts crying and the dude goes into a full on panic trying to calm it down, almost becoming aggressive with the small swaddled person. I try to calm him down, as scaring his kid isn't going to help anything. I put my hand on his shoulder and he looks at me with so much pure terror in his face my stomach turned upside down, he says to me ""You don't understand, that damn raccoon will be back to drag him down."" In this moment I kind of realize that something else had happened other than just a pretty serious car accident. I hear someone let out a shriek behind me, the man and I turn our attention back towards the sinking van. An unconscious woman is laying face down in the mud, and standing on top of her body is a shiny eyed raccoon. It's just looking at the crowd of people. Then people start screaming and shouting things both in english and mandarin. The raccoon nuzzles it's long nose into the nape of this woman's neck and starts digging around her hair with it's weird people hands. Then it starts pulling on some fabric. And it just keeps pulling until it drags out from under this adult woman's body another baby in a light blue onesie. The baby starts crying and I immediately spring up into action. 

I race over to this fucking raccoon and pick up a branch. I reach my hand down to grab the baby but the raccoon uses it's body to cover the him and hisses at me. It made such a gross fucking sound. I try to swing at the raccoon as if it was a golf ball but then I really didn't want to hurt this baby. So reach down to try and pick up this raccoon by the scruff like a cat, which works! I'm able to pry this fucking rodent off and grab the kid. I then take the raccoon and throw him as hard and as far as I can back into the swamp. I scoop up the baby and start examining him for bites or scrapes. 

So, side note, I guess? I don't care for kids much. Other people's kids are cool but I've never wanted my own and I still don't. But this baby was so god damn adorable. It was a perfect pudgy little thing with beautiful brown eyes; albeit, he was covered in mud and crying, but damn he was cute. 

I turn back to the crowd of people and they are all petrified, looking in my direction. Soon enough they all start yelling again. And wouldn't you know it but the damn raccoon has returned and he is PISSED this time. He crawls up my back and bites me in the left shoulder. I fall backwards in a panic. The raccoon hurriedly begins dragging the baby from my arms and away again. He makes it to a hole in the bank just above where the water from the pond reaches. The raccoon drags this little helpless, now screaming infant down with him. 

I clutch my bleeding shoulder and dart over to the bank. One of the crash survivors catches up to me, he gives me a flashlight and says something very serious in mandarin. I make it to the burrow like hole and plant my feet in the knee deep water in front of it. I start throwing fist fulls of mud behind me. I can hear the baby screaming in terror. It was almost like it was echoing through the earth itself. I shine the flashlight down the larger hole I've dug and I can see one of the legs of the baby's onesie sticking out. I reach my arm in and try to pull him out as safely as I can. The FUCKING RACCOON returns and sinks his teeth into my right forearm this time. I just try and wince through the pain so I can at least recover the baby. The raccoon keeps his bite tight into my skin as I pull both him and the baby from the ground. This raccoon is dangling by his mouth from my arm and I'm holding a baby by the leg as if I had just assisted in his birth. I set the flashlight down and grab the raccoon by the scruff with my left hand. I set the baby down on the bank in front of me. 

I'm holding this raccoon as tightly as I can. He's struggling and screeching and gurgling. Just all around being really fucking disturbing. His eyes are beaming up at me. His mouth starts foaming and I realize that I am now diseased from this fucking garbage monster's bites. I walk back a bit, still facing the bank and press his face down into the pond water. I hold him there for quite a while until finally his body becomes lifeless in my hands. I am finally triumphant yet there is no victory feeling.

At this point I turn around and let this fucker's little body drift out to the middle of the pond like a viking funeral. His corpse gets about 10 ft away before something from the black water snaps it from bellow. I scurry out backwards and scoop up the baby who is still crying. I grab my flash light and shine it into the water directly in front of me. There are three absolutely massive alligator gar floating there exactly where I was just kneeling. The one in the center is almost golden while the other two are albino. They're absent black eyes look up at me and the baby. They're stares are still the most unsettling thing about this whole experience. 

I was there having a very creepy stare down with three huge alligator gar, cradling a baby that wasn't mine, bleeding and having to deal with rabies now. Then I woke up. 

&#x200B;

So yea thats it. what the actual fuck. fUCK raccoons man. I was always cool with them until last night. And I haven't even thought about alligator gar in literal years??? I'm not from the south so they're not even at all a common thing I would ever think about??? It's just such a specific fish that I didn't even realize I knew the name of until this morning?????????? I think I saw them in an aquarium once when I was a kid and that's how i even know what the fuck they are. whAt??

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** I came across a car accident in a swamp. A rabid asshole raccoon was stealing the survivors babies. This raccoon beat my ass until I drowned him. I rescued a baby from an earth womb. And a squad of really creepy alligator gar stared me the fuck down. 

&#x200B;

**Another note** about me, I used to have reoccurring nightmares that were super similar to this one when I was younger. They all have to do with children and a swamp, usually children being trapped in mud by some weird entity. Either I would have to rescue them, or my dream self would just be watching the events unfold and unable to take action, kind of like a conscious camera. Those nightmares started probably when I was around 12 and really messed me up for a long time. SO much so that I haven't been swimming in fresh water since these started. This raccoon dream seems as though it's just a different version of the old ones I used to have. I'm just annoyed because I thought I had gotten over this?? Its been about a year since I had a dream with these themes and I've never been able to actually unravel what any of this imagery means. I can post about the old version later, I just really needed to get this one out of my head. I feel a lot better already, but I'm not excited to go to sleep tonight if I have to get my ass kicked by a raccoon again. 

Thanks in advance if anyone has any suggestions,

Okay so I used to dream about concrete rooms constantly. Sometimes it would be this abandoned school that I convinced myself was real, but after trying to explain to my friend that we had been there I realized that the school disnt exist. I have had dreams about bringing pretty much all my friends there, one at a time. 

Sometimes it would be a dark street with no light and the only people on the street would be hostile and chase me. 

Other times I would be lost in a warehouse. 

The school one was definitely the most significant, I actually believed it existed and that I took my friends there. Often the things we would do in the school would be dangerous or emotionally draining. 

I stopped having these dreams around the time I started dating my finace 2 years ago.

This dream is weird not because I dreamt of being the other gender, but because I felt partially lucid in it, more lucid than most dreams. BTW... SSP means Secret Space Program)

So in this dream, it was in different perspectives at times so that's how I knew the person I was dreaming from a first person point of view from was a blonde girl. It starts out with her going into this check-in like station, and getting a blue wrist-watch like Identificator, next thing I know I'm seeing through her eyes and it feels as if I have a tiny-bit of lucid-like-control, but not really. I'm walking around and I have this blue thing on my wrist, walking by guys and girls, I sometimes thought as I walked by guys if they'd be checking me out since I'm a girl, but none of them cared, as a matter of fact, I seemed shorter than most everyone I saw. I must've been younger, like 15 or 16, since everyone was either really tall or looked like they were simply older. I walked around for a while until I got to these windows, I looked out and could see Earth, I was in space, I saw some ships floating out there and what looked like a gigantic submarine, with huge tubes on one end of it, the other end, had a big gun that was like a turret. I watched the turret look around on it's axis, and it then faced me and stopped, I felt shocked at that moment realizing it could see me, then a guy came up beside me and put his hand on my shoulder, he said ""Magnificent war machine, isn't it?"" I looked up at the guy and this is where my lucidity kicked in a bit. Instead of nodding or saying ""Yes sir!"" I smiled wryly and said, ""Will it fire?"" and he just sort of walked away, not saying a thing. It was weird because I still felt lucid a bit, so I kept walking around until I got to this room, a storage room of some sort, I went in it and found a small box that looked like a video game box that you can open and get something from it. So I did just that, opened it and found another wrist Identificator, but this one was gold, not blue. I grabbed it and hid it in the palm of my hand, again, lucidity comes back and I hide it better by making a fist, and putting my fist in my pocket. I go back to walking aimlessly, until she takes me to an elevator and this is where I seriously get lucid. The man from before walks into the elevator, and I squeeze this Identificator so hard, I feel pain shoot in my hand. He plucks some buttons and he looks at me, he says, ""Aren't you a bit too young and pretty to be an Engineer here?"" I look at my blue Identificator and it says just that, I repeat what I read, ""Electrical Engineer. Yeah, I'm good at it."" He says, in an extremely creepy tone, ""Hey, as long as you're good at it, we're good."" and I look and he has his hand on his piece (a gun on his hip, not a normal gun either) and I start feeling raw fear again, this time, I wake up and I remembered it all.

Upon waking up, I felt so bad because I felt as if I could protect her with my knowledge, like, if he tried to do something to her, I would've been able to do something back use a dirty move to hurt him, like thumbs in the eyes or a nut-punch, but I don't think he was even going to do anything. I don't know, but what's weird is her outfit and other people's outfits looked kinda like the Dead Space suit Isaac wears. However, the guy I kept seeing was in a business shirt with a red tie, his pants were black business pants, despite his unfitting choice of wardrobe, he looked far more muscular and taller than everyone else I saw.

At some point I went inside a pipe, it ended up at the sea and it was really dark, I was a dolphin and I was terrified of the loneliness and the space. At some point it al went away when I found other dolphins and sea creatures. It was still dark but it was swimming freely. 

The second part was immediately after this, I was talking to two kids. A boy around 10 and a little girl around 7. They were back from their swimming class or something, they were explaining to me how to play a certain game. There was this big window on this room/living room, we were 7 to 10 floors up on an apartment building. This little girl went outside the window once and I didn’t say anything (or her brother). She came back inside, she was holding her teddy bear, it just seemed natural what she was doing. Until her brother left to go shower and for a second time she opened this window, closed it behind her and just jumped. I heard her screaming and the thump on the ground. In the dream I was just paralyzed, I didn’t move from my chair, I didn’t call anybody, I was just shocked. I woke up screaming though, my boyfriend had to calm me down. I can’t remember who she was or her face. I don’t have any kids, I have nephews and nieces but that’s all and we’re not very close.

Nothing about the house had changed. All the old furniture was there. Even my old bedroom was still the same!

I couldnt stop staring at this picture and eventually my dad stepped out of the painting and chased me around the house, that had suddenly become a maz. Only the thing is, I knew this wasnt my dad.

I’m on my way back home from Sobeys, walking (there is a Sobeys on a busy street close to home). While walking, I’m thinking to myself how the Devil has been able to push me around… physically. It’s as if I was explaining this to someone I knew close to me, but he/she was not there with me at the time, so I was just thinking this in my head.  

As I’m thinking about it, it happens and my body is dragged backwards along the sidewalk on its own. Imagine a puppet master pulling on my strings, pulling me back towards Sobeys along the sidewalk, while I’m on my back. Then, the puppet master lifts me up next to a house and makes my body level with the ground. The devil positions me over a column. I knew that if he dropped me, which he did, I would be impaled. But, when he did, somehow I managed to land on my feet next to the pole with no recollection of falling, only being dropped. I has this feeling / thought in the back of my mind that the Devil couldn't really hurt me, only cause a lot of grief and stress. 

All this, except the Devil cannot be seen, just like I couldn’t see the strings he was pulling me by. I also remember looking out at the street and wondering what this looks like to bystanders as I am pretty sure this phenomenon only happens to me. 

After this ordeal, I continue walking home. At the corner where the daycare is, I see my car parked but it looked crashed into the daycare. Its right side was higher than its left, with its back right wheel off the ground. The back right wheel was also seriously crooked, facing 45 degrees towards the street. 

Somehow, a pretty girl about my age (I’m 27), blonde, short, and small, appeared next to me and we talked briefly about the car and what I think happened. I swear she has been in many of my dreams but I can never remember her. I told her to ignore the car and forget what happened to it. We continued to walk away but instead of going to my house, we went to what looked like the Playter Estates streets; the one with the curve in it (about 2 minutes from my house).

The street was dark as if trees with big, lush leaves blocked out the sun. Out of nowhere, a group of “friends” showed up and asked the girl and me if we wanted to go to one of their houses and do drugs. I called these people ""my friends"", but I knew inside that I didn’t really like them, all except the girl. 

I immediately said no. The boy doing the asking turned to the girl and repeated the question to her. Slowly, she nodded her head. He asked if that’s a yes, and she whispered yes. I was confused, unable to understand why the girl would say yes to do drugs. It just didn't feel right' didn't suit her. I said almost angrily that “fine, I was going to come as well, but just to be there, not to do drugs”.

Then change of scene I saw Den - a guy I was with for 10 days when I was abroad and I had sex with him everyday and he was super compatible which was a change after my last  2 relationships (abusive and serious for me and casual sex for the other guy). We danced in the moonlight(slow dancing) , did all couple things- he called it a mini relationship. I have an anxious attachment style (which I recently found out)- I was hooked. After I left we were long distance for October and then he said he cant do long distance and we should stop having video calls but we can still talk. I text him and he replies ALWAYS but as friends and never flirts. I know its over but as my attachment style is anxious and he is the only person who treated me so good and calmed me downed and loved me and maybe I was more happy because of the hormones.

He appeared in my dream. Three Den while I was in front of the mirror. He was so real - exactly him.

The third and the last one was that there were about two different men at different instances in black clothes trying to jump on me and stop my breathing.

I again had a vivid dream last night. My problems with my dreams is that I feel that i really exist in them and i think the same as when I am in reality. Like, in reality and in my dreams I can think anticipate etc etc just like in reality. 

So my dream, was a mass of nonsense (obviously) i remember i was in a forest where the trees were all dried out and they were huge. The main color of the atmosphere was brown. Some of the trees had a sort of weird light around it. Like it was magical. So i took a picture with my phone because I like taking pictures. Then, I arrived at my workplace (i don’t have a job in reality i am a student) with computers. And they were the people from my high school - (the ones that stopped talking to me since 3 years and i felt the feeling, the specific feeling that i felt each time i would walk to class, alone, when everyone would be staring at me) - there was Maxime, and two others, that I forgot who they were. I asked Maxime a question, and he didn’t answer me. The two others looked at me. Knowing they looked I didn’t want to be left speechless. So...I reacted silly and said - “Fine. don’t ever ever talk to me when you need me because you don’t.” Then I went to see Clara, (another girl from reality that I didn’t talked to since 3 years from my high school) i told her about Maximes answer, but I remembered that he ignored me, because it was justified . I did something horrible in high school since then everyone turned their backs on me... Anyways, when I told her about it, she didn’t react. So we started setting up the computer because it was my job. 
We, clara and me. Decided to go out because she wanted to talk. And when we got outside i decided to go to the toilets and the toilets were separated from the main wood building which was small. So, I started walking in the direction of the toilettes. And when going to the toilet, on the road on my left I saw a black tesla car with two passengers in the front. And I was scared of them. I saw that they didn’t saw me. So, i decided i’d directly go back and see Clara to tell her to hide herself *they are dangerous* but when walking back to her, I saw the car parked with no one inside. And i knew, he would take Clara as a hostage. He came out and said : “you thought you would run away easily from me” and pointed the gun at me and I felt like I knew I would die.

Then this korean girl in my class walks over to me and tells me she wants a hug because she's sad. So I give her a hug that seemed to take forever... and the math teacher tells us to split up and gives a 10 min lecture on how that was inappropriate for school and broke the ""no sexual gestures in school"" rule. 

The thing is, everything happen with real people that I know, and the whole situation and the reactions fo the people fit up with their personalities. The girl I was hugging is sometimes really sensitive, and the teacher is sometimes strict (once spent half a class period lecturing us on cheating after finding out everyone cheated on a take-home quiz). I have at one point liked the girl that I hugged, but I got over it and no longer feel any attraction for her. I honestly don't know what this means at all, so I'm asking others to possibly interpret this.

My father passed away in September due to injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident. His death wasn't technically unexpected, as I had five days to prepare while he was on life support in ICU, but I never expected my father to die before I turn thirty, get married, become who I'm becoming, etc. He was my best friend.

For the past couple of months, I've been having dreams about my dad. They always pretty much follow the same pattern: I'm with my dad in various familiar locations, doing things we used to do together (eating dinner, hanging out with family, watching TV), and everything is fine. But then I always have the sudden realization that he's going to die soon. It seems these dreams always take place a couple of weeks or so before the date of his accident (August 30). I've had six so far - the most recent being last night. In the dreams, I struggle internally over whether I should warn him of his impending death or just enjoy the time I have left with him. I always decide not to tell him - though in the most recent dream, I did try to do everything in my power to convince him not to go out for a motorcycle ride. 

I love seeing my dad in my dreams and feeling like I'm getting to spend time with him, but I do wish they weren't clouded by what I'll never be able to change. 

Anyway, I'd love any interpretations you may have, or advice on how I could redirect these dreams and simply enjoy the ""time"" with my dad. Thanks, dreamreddit. <3

I was at My elementary  school. with a lot of people near dark, when a volcano in the distance shot up a ring of fire. I remember being really scared and looking towards my dad and he told me it would be okay. But then more rings of fire started to shoot out and swarm off into the distance, creating one giant circle of rings of fire. Everyone passed out on the ground but was still conscious. Each ring of fire had the devil in it which looked like a skeleton type thing and dates in Roman numerals.
The devil would try to speak to you and tell you something that would happen on that date but I wouldn’t listen. I’d try to close my eyes and try hard not to listen to each ring of fire as it passed over me.
When the devil was done telling everyone what would happen on these dates for them he told us that the earth would only last three more years.
So each date represented something terrible that would happen in a persons life for the next three years till the world ends.
Even if the world was going to end I did not want to know what was going to be terrible for the next three years. The devil tried to send me notes with the dates and the terrible things but I refused to look.
My friends would tell me of the terrible things that would happen to them in the future. And even though it was hard for me not to look what was going to happen to me, I never looked.
Later on in the dream Jesus visited us to help us prepare for what will happen in three years.

I’m not sure if this will be useful but I’m currently a freshman in college dealing with a lot of deadlines and feeling pretty lost, anxious, and depressed as of the moment. Anyways, I had a really strange long dream that kept on changing. It was pretty long that I ended up not remembering everything. The dream weirded me out today.

The first part of my dream involved me roaming around an anique mansion that felt haunted. I can’t remember much of it but this will pop up again later. 

Then the dream shifted to me and my best friend running to a place to meet up with someone. When we did meet up with that person, it was apparently some guy I don’t recognize. He was a big guy (I don’t remember what his face) but I greeted him with a hug (Just a reminder though, I’m not a person who doesn’t give out hugs to meet someone. I only give hugs when someone’s really feeling down) and for some reason, I really liked his hug. Eventually, I was alone with the guy and we walked around. I enjoyed being around him like he was a pretty warm guy to be around. I eventually encountered some of my friends in my block and my best friend and was relieved for some reason and hugged them. 

Then again the dream changed to me traveling with my family(my grandparents, my uncle and aunt, my parents, and my 3 siblings) somewhere. We were in a place that involved a lot of bleachers(I think it was a sports stadium. I can’t quite remember) and we had to leave to go to another place which I don’t know where. I was lagging behind because I left my things in a bench far from my area and I had to get it. I was also putting on my shoes because I apparently wasn’t wearing them. Then when I caught up with them, we were riding a taxi cab to the place we were supposed to go. In the cab, it was my grandparents, my uncle, my dad, and 2 of my siblings riding the car. My dad, my siblings, and I were riding in the back of the car and it was pretty cramped. When the taxi was driving, we were passing by that same antique mansion in the first part of my dream. When the driver was driving through an area of the mansion, there were a lot of paintings hanging on the walls of the mansions outside. The paintings on the wall were like the paintings you would see in the vatican or a museum that had renaissance paintings. And I think the paintings had biblical characters, I recognized a few but I can’t recall when I woke up). Apparently, I was the only one in that car who was surprised and amazed with all of this and my dad casually said that he still needs to explore more of the mansion.

Then the dream shifted yet again, this time I heard my prof giving advice to students about doing a haunted mansion attraction. I was with my mom and my little sister. We were all going to this haunted mansion attraction thing. When we were riding it, it was a single rider kind of thing and it felt like an attraction from disneyland. We went through an luxurious abandoned dining hall with a ghost at the end. I wasn’t scared until I realized my little sister and mom were gone. Then at one point, I was brought to a dark vent and eventually I fell out of the vent and ended up in a poorly made haunted corridor in a school that had nothing but many doors and labels. Them  a speaker challenged me to solve the riddle.  Each label had a task that I had to do but there were “lives” involved like in a video game. For a long time, I was petrified with fear. I was alone and I didn’t know what to do. Then, several people fell out of the vent. Again it was my friends from my block from the second part of the dreams and another stranger was there. But this time it was a girl. I was so happy and relieved they were there so I greeted all of them with a hug. We were all trying to solve the mystery and the girl was super cheerful and lively. She kept on talking to me for some reason but I didn’t mind. Then, I heard a loud knocking sounds and woke up.

I wake up inside the ship, except now it Is a transatlantic and it's half filled with water.

My terror peaks as i see some of these man jumping in the water with cans that they open, freezing themselves.

For the last week, I’ve been having these different dreams that involve someone (36M and a really good friend/father figure) who used to be a large influence in my life, but no longer is. We had a sort of falling out last November’s and while it was the mature and mutual break-ups I’ve ever had, it was still painful. 

Dream #1 - Sunday 1/13/19
My friend and I were at my parent’s house. I was cooking us dinner and we were chatting having a good time reminiscing on the old days. We were both older in this dream and somehow we had gotten in the topic of the people in our life. He started telling me about his new friend that reminded him a lot about me and how he and his family always invite him over for family dinners and holidays (all things that he used to do to me). Then at the end of this ballad about his new friend he looks at me straight in the face and tells me that he hopes I never meet him and that I need to not tell anyone about us hanging out or the conversation. - I woke up very sad and confused.

Dream #2 - Wednesday 1/16/19
I was going to the gym to work out. Usually my friend and I go together in the waking world, but not anymore and this time in my dream, I was alone. I was going through my routine when I hear someone telling me “You can’t do that”, “That’s a bad idea”, “You’re going to hurt yourself.” It was my friend at the gym talking down to me. I ignore him and do what I was doing anyways. He comes up to spot me and is too overly helpful and ends up ruining my sets. When I asked him to stop, he looks at me then put his bodyweight on the bar and I am unable to get it up. - I woke up extremely angry.

Dream #3 - 1/19/19
I started doing kickboxing (for real in the waking world) and was in a lesson with a few of my new classmates. We were learning a technique when my friend barges in asking to be taught too. The instructor lets him join, so now my friend is stumbling around looking for a place to change into his gym clothes. He announces that he is drunk and starts stripping in the middle of the room. I go to handle the situation and baby him into a bathroom. He starts being a noisy drunk, and I am forced to leave the lesson to take him home. - I woke up feeling embarrassed and confused by his behavior.

This is long, I know. This guy used to mean a lot to me, he was my main source of support when I moved away from home. We work together and share a cubicle wall so I see him every workday. There is no tension between us and we still have conversations, but they are kept on a superficial level.

It starts out with just darkness, like a black screen. I hear the sound of a car driving through heavy rain and a female voice humming--not a melody of any kind but more of just an idle, content sort of humming.
Then, the dream really starts. I am with a number of kids between 12 and 18, waiting in front of a large building. With us are a handful of young men and women, around 20-25 y/o. They are dressed in clothes that resemble flight attendant costumes. The kids around me chat with each other and the attendants, but I am more of an observer. Finally, they tell us we can go inside, and the doors in front of us open.

The inside of the building looks like a museum. It's a long winding corridor with many weird turns, but doesn't feel claustrophobic or anything, more... Regal (?). It's almost dark, the only light comes from artsy looking tumbleweed lamps that are scattered on the floor. The ceiling is extremely low, and there are numerous small deer walking around--like so small they just reach my knees. Nobody finds this weird or anything though. We just walk through and some of us pet the deer.

We reach a large hall at the end of the corridor, and the attendants tell us to go inside and sit down. They close the door behind us. The hall is actually a cinema, with no seats but just pillows on the floor in front of a huge screen. Once we're all seated, the 'movie' starts. The screen stays black, but we hear.... a car driving through heavy rain and a female voice humming.

Then it's over. The others talk among themselves again but it all just sounds like gibberish. We leave the building, and the attendants lead us down a set of stairs into an underground station. The tram arrives, and I get on, but when I look around its filled with trash and none of the others got on with me. I walk through the trash (knee-deep), not finding a seat. All the other passengers ignore me.

And that's where it ends.

I think about this dream so often. When it comes, it never feels creepy or anything, more solemn or maybe a bit sad- I often feel sad when I wake up. The parts that confuse me the most are:

- The 'attendants'. 
- The humming woman, and the significance of driving through rain. 
- The tiny fuckin' deer.

At the time of this dream I was going through severe depressive thoughts and anxiety because I was most likely not going back to college (money issues)  and wasn't sure if id have a place to stay or a way to pay back the massive debt I was about to be under. If I had a place to stay I would be basically  alone,  miserable  and cut off. I hadn't told anyone except my closest friend who was far away and going through a hard time themselves so we weren't talking as much and when we did I didn't say anything (which I was okay with because they needed my help more). I was lonely and felt like no one was listening to me. I had no internet so I had nothing to distract me. I was hoping for a miracle and hating myself for it.

My throat feels ""disconnected"" (severed at the top). I go to my grandmother who is down the hallway into the living room.My voice is scratchy and I'm having trouble speaking and it gets worse as I continue. I tell her my throat feels disconnected and I don't think she responds but It feels like she does so I continue. I say it's probably just strep throat or something and she affirms without speaking .

I get up calmly and poke my head out of my door frame to calmly call for my grandmother to help. No response. I keep calling, my vision getting worse and I start to panic yelling now.

Then the exact same scenario repeats, the whole play resets. Only now the man takes my gun and says a little speech about it, how he likes the way the old world approached hand guns, the extra effort of pulling the trigger. He then allows a young girl in the congregation to fire the revolver off into a nearby window. It is a beautiful stained glass window. The gun fires without a sound, the window does not shatter, but the bullet pierces through it without leaving a trace. People outside react with surprise and look in. The scene then seamlessly transforms; The reception hall becomes a crowded bus and the commander is a woman.

0.0,ahcygz,0.0,1.0,"Dream 1: I was in my town home complex (a circle of maybe 80 town homes) running from something. I had a feeling of apocalypse level doom. The sky was a dark gray covered in clouds. I was running from the house I used to live in to the one I currently live in (around 15 houses down), but I ran to the other side of the circle and around instead of straight down the line of houses. I eventually ran back across the lot towards the house I now live in, and the parking lot expanded to twice its actual size. When I got halfway across the lot I noticed 2 things: the door to the house was wide open, and there was a concert lighting rig with no stage set up in front of the house. I realized I was running to the house because I didn't want to die alone, but among my friends who were waiting inside. But I had to get past the people giving what I guess was a mini concert in front of the house. The people giving the concert were women who had a military look, white tank top, green cargo pants, and a uniform hat. One woman, their leader was singing, and as I ran past her I was smiling huge and waving and bowing to try and show I supported her, even though I knew she was evil, I just wanted to get past her and into the house. Her guards tried to stop me, but she told them I was a supporter and to let me pass by. I got into the house and slammed the door behind me, all my friends were safe inside but worried and scared.

Dream 2: My parents and I (and I think a friend was maybe with us) were traveling on a vacation trip, except we were staying at a house within the town home complex I live in. We were given the keys to stay in a house that everyone knew was haunted, thus no one wanted to live there (it isn't actually haunted in real life, that we know of). They had a sign on the door naming it ""Mary's house"". Everyone knew that the ghost of the Virgin Mary was in the front corner bedroom of the house. Every town home has the same layout, and the front corner bedroom is the one I actually live in. My parents told me I would be sleeping in that bedroom, and we all looked up into the windows and saw her peering down on us. The house had an eerie feeling, but we went along with it. I went into my bedroom and saw her there standing and waiting for me. She stood there all night watching me, and at one point leaped at me. That was when I ran out of the house and refused to go back in.

I can't help but wonder if this has anything to do with my sexuality. I came out to a few friends as bisexual a little over a year ago. I can't tell my family because I know they'd kick me out. So every time I stay with my parents over break, I have to pretend to be the good little Christian girl who is totally straight. My parents definitely do control a lot more of my life than I'd like, including trying to tell me what to do with my future. They expect me to move back in with them after graduation and stay with them until I marry a man. It's one of my biggest fears that if I move back in with them, they'll use every tactic they know to get me to stay with them forever. I'm 23 and not even allowed to go most places alone (only church, the library, and coffee shop), never allowed to leave the house after 6 pm, and not allowed to travel to any town (other than my college town) without one of them as a chaperone.

Hi so I don’t really know where to start with this. I’m a 21yr old female. I don’t smoke weed, I drink on the weekends and occasionally during the week but rarely. I don’t usually dream if I get a little too drunk on the weekends. I’m not on any medication other than birth control. 

I have always had pretty messed up dreams, ever since I was a kid. They’ve ranged from a reoccurring dream of me being murdered in front of my classmates (had this dream from elementary school through middle school) to countless other dreams of killing people (most recently killing my mother?), dreams of suicide, dreams of animal abuse, etc. 

Trust me, I hate these dreams more than anything, they’re terrifying. I have no thoughts of harming myself or others, I don’t know why I dream about this stuff. I promise i’m not a psychopath lol. 

I do have pleasant dreams sometimes, but the bad outweigh the good. The last three weeks I’ve had a nightmare pretty much every single night (sometimes more than one as they often wake me up) and I think it could have a little bit to do with sleep deprivation as I don’t get nearly as much as I should and I am CONSTANTLY tired. I have multiple dreams I could type out for interpretation (they’re always insanely vivid, I remember some from years ago), but my curiosity right now lies more with the intense emotion I’m feeling “in” these dreams. Last week or so, I had a dream and long story short - I  “took a bullet” (actually I remember 7 specifically) for my dad. His friend for whatever reason pulled a gun and started shooting at him but I got in the way, and just stood there looking at him as he shot me over and over in the stomach. I remember like “feeling” the pain in my stomach, I know that sounds crazy but I swear it was like I could feel each bullet and the pain (obviously not as bad as a real gunshot would hurt, but pain).  

I had a dream two nights ago that my ex boyfriend committed suicide (I did actually have an ex boyfriend commit suicide a few months ago but this is a different ex) and when I woke up I was so overwhelmed with emotion I had to check and make sure that it didn’t actually happen because I really couldn’t distinguish if it was real or not. It felt so real, crying in my dream and talking to people about it that I really thought for a minute that it might have been a reality. 

So then, last night I had a dream that I was at a friends house and she was killing a turtle (stepping on its shell) right in front of me and I was bawling my eyes out and screaming for her to stop and I was so upset that when I woke up I was almost in tears and my chest hurt like I had actually been feeling such immense sadness. 

I just don’t ever really remember feeling so much emotion, pain, and sadness as I have been feeling in my dreams lately. I guess I’m just wondering what this could mean or if there’s a reason for it?

And I'm not calling him that because we parted on bad terms, it was a point of pride for him, he wore it like a badge of honor. At one point i witnessed him screaming at and cussing out his 4yo daughter for stealing the spot light from him.

So with that back story it may explain my reaction when in my dream he shows up at my house with his daughter and new girlfriend. I gave him a begrudging hi just to be courteous cause that's how i roll, gave his daughter a big hug and some toys to play with, shoved his girlfriend out of the kitchen and said if she and him weren't a package deal with the kid they wouldn't be welcome so don't bother with the niceties.

And then i proceeded to destroy literally everything in the house. Nothing was safe. If it was breakable, it was broken. If it was unbreakable, well i found a way to break it. I had a few (i think 3?) aquariums with Terrapin, so i set them free and smashed the aquariums.

So after i was done with the house, it kinda turned into a video game where i kicked the (8 foot brick wall) fence down and started destroying everything i could touch in the neighborhood. Broke the neighborhood fence border and then went out into space and destroyed as much of the world as i could, and it was like playing Super Mario Brothers i swear, just find the stars and time it just right to run a rampage on everything till we've got the whole scorched earth thing going on.

Anyways, I dreamed that I found out I was pregnant with his child. I felt iffy about keeping the baby because our relationship is a bit rocky, but he immediately stepped up and said that he absolutely wanted this baby and he would love to work things out with me and have a family together. I was so happy and felt ready for this baby. I was telling friends and family and coworkers about it and everyone was so happy for me.

The following morning, I woke up confused/worried because it felt so realistic, especially the pregnancy symptoms, and I worried for a bit that I might actually be pregnant. 

A little more background that may help: I actually never want children so it was surprising to experience such an intense happy emotion towards pregnancy. In my dream I loved being pregnant and was looking forward to starting a family with him.

 So my dream was : me and a friend of mine (wasn’t really a person I know in real life, but kind of knew we were close in my dream) were in the schoolyard across the street from where I live (I’ve spent a lot of time there when I was younger) and there were some friends of my friend there so we went over to talk to them. As we’re walking towards them I see this puppy with one of the girls - it was a german shepherd but kind of a liver color? (not important) . So I see the puppy, naturally get all happy and excited because I love dogs, but the second we walk over, its demeanour changed completely. It curled up, started crying (with tears I mean) started having these convulsions and began foaming at the mouth. As this is happening, the group of friends were acting like nothing was wrong with the situation (my friend included) which was super strange to me. So I decided to ask the owner of the dog what the fuck was wrong with it, but instead of actually asking a question I just ended up stating the (not so?) obvious and went “your dog is kind of sick huh?”. /just want to add a side not here - At this stage of the dream I was kind of weirded out, but feeling calm/ So the second I mentioned to the owner about her sick dog, she just looked at me with a sad smile and started to cry. The dog was also crying and it looked really sad and was now, in addition to all the other stuff, howling. This is where I start to freak out, I grab my friend and tell her that we’re going for a walk. (By the way it was a beautiful summer day and there were a lot of people at the schoolyard and everyone seemed really happy) As we were walking I decided to stop and look what was going on with the dog, because it was not on a leash and I was scared that it was going to follow us. And what a fucking surprise!! - it did.  The second I saw it, I just completely lost my shit and I asked the dog wtf it was doing there and the dog just looked at me but made this strange (human) face that I couldn’t quite work out.

&#x200B;

So I was walking through my local park with my friend and we were talking about various things such as the new Smash Bros game and things we would normally talk about. The initial mood of the dream was very nice, the sun was out and the grass was very green as I remember it. We walked on to the high street and I realized some sort of birthday event was going on, the high street was closed off to cars and there was a large table laid out in the street for the birthday celebrators. Some guy in a birthday hat came up to us and said ""HAPPY THANKSGIVING!"" to us, which I laughed at because I live in the UK and it was clearly a birthday celebration. Anyway my friend decides to walk into a nearby shop, and I receive a text from my mum so I tell him i'll wait outside.

&#x200B;

I opened my phone and realized my mum had sent me at least 50 texts, with most text having clearly been manufactured by spamming the smartphone keyboard with random letters and some saying very panicked phrases (those I cannot exactly remember). But there were three messages that struck me as soon as I saw them, and I vividly remember what they said. 

Mum: DONT LOOK

Mum: AT THEIR EYES

The last message was a picture, and it was very unsettling at first sight, but even more after close examination. It was a man peering through her front window with his hands up to the window, but by zooming into the image I noticed something was very off about his face. His eyes and mouth looked very unusual, almost as if they were upside down. Immediately after, all the messages were gone and a very loud siren kind of noise emitted from my phone, not like an alarm bell but a very fast fire alarm kind of noise. My phone was vibrating way harder than usual.It was one of those Government broadcasted emergency notifications. I looked at the text, and all it said was ""There is no speed limit. Enjoy the ride"". 

&#x200B;

I look up and see several cars absolutely booting it down the road at speeds you would expect on a motorway, heading right towards the birthday celebration. They knocked through the makeshift bollards put up to close the road and they instantly crashed into the table, knocking cake and presents in the air. The fact that they had crashed into the table didnt seem to stop them from driving, the drivers were all clearly flooring it regardless of what they had done. Then cars from the other end of the high street began to drive at the same speed head on to the cars that had just past me. Then the crashes started, all the cars ended up in a giant wreck in the middle of the road, mixed in with tables and chairs. I dared not look at the scene of fear of seeing the worst of things, dead children. Instead I focussed on saving those who had crashed first. I went to one of the cars and opened the door, but I realized there was no driver. I shouted to anyone but to no response. I looked at some more cars to find them all to be empty. I then realized it was dead silent, no one running from the scene or climbing out of the chaos, just absolute silence. The only noise was the siren coming from my phone. I looked at the tables to see no one, and the streets were completely empty too. So I walked further down the high street and still no one. But then I looked in the distance and I saw a figure. Standing completely still and looking in my direction. I called to the man I saw and he did not respond. So I jogged closer and realized he still wasnt moving. As I walked down the street and I got closer and closer to him I was getting creeped out at his posture, he just stood there with his head kinda tilted, but still looking directly at me. I was now on the opposite pavement to him, I look him dead in the eye and see a normal looking guy, except for one thing. His eyes and mouth were upside down, and this gave him a horrified expression, even though if his face were normal he would be smiling. I turn to run after remembering my mums text, springting for about five minutes without turning back. I didnt hear him pursue so I thought I was safe. I look ahead in the direction I was sprinting however and see him sprinting right towards me at an almost superhuman speed. I first questioned how he went from being behind me to being infront of me. Then I was frozen completely still and couldnt move. When he reached me he grabbed me and started screaming at me in gibberish, but because of the way his face was it looked like he was laughing. Then I woke up after that.

0.0,ageqwg,0.0,1.0,"Two nights ago I (F21) dreamed of reconciling with my ex best friend (M22). Some background (it's a lot but provides an insight on our dynamic)...We were hired at the same time at a high end clothing store. Throughout the two years, we were on the same path as women’s and men’s lead stylists and we were also the only two that lasted from the group that was originally hired with us. At first, it was super hard to get him to open up. He was cautious about being friends with coworkers, which I understood and respected. But we finally graduated to taco nights at his place and breakfast every Sunday before work. I’m a Taurus and he was a Virgo which are super compatible and we got along wonderfully. Also, I gravitate towards Virgo’s; my mom is one, first guy I loved and multiple exes, as well as many friends are virgos. Now I will say that sometimes things felt very one sided. I was always the one asking to hang out, buying gifts, pretty much begging to be his friend it seemed but I was honestly okay with that. After two years, I got hired at new store and expressed my concerns that, because we weren’t working together, things would change and we wouldn’t see each other anymore. But he made sure to confirm that we would still be friends and keep up with our little traditions. Well, two weeks after I started the new job, he ghosted me. When I visited my old store, he even ignored me despite knowing very well that I was there. Like zero eye contact and such. But I honestly kind of expected it to happen. My boyfriend warned me and I had seen previous behaviors that leaned towards this. Because of my expectations, I didn’t take it too hard. It was a time of change and I was going forth with an open mind and realization things weren’t going to stay the same. Through meditation, journaling, and such I had also sorted through the sadness and emotions accompanying all this.

So the dream...I was in (a dream version which I’ve visited multiple times) of Los Angeles and had this incredible urge to get to a specific bookstore. I was on a bike (I think) and there were obstacles like annoying people, traffic, stoplights, hills. Despite all these, I was on such a mission to get there, I would do anything such as running lights through oncoming traffic. I got to the bookstore before him and was causally walking around but had this feeling of anticipation, a very nervous but excited feeling. I was up front by a sunny window which was adjacent to the door skimming a book to keep busy. He walked in and it was a very similar feeling of when I went a visited my old store to say hi but much more positive. As he walked in I perked up and tried to make eye contact across the room. In the dream, he met my eyes and smiled and looked very happy to see me, like he missed me (which differs from real life because when I tried to make eye contact at my store he ignored me). We walked across the room to each other and warmly embraced. I felt so so happy. Happy that he was even there, that he looked at me, for his attention. I, unfortunately, can’t remember much past that because that moment was so overwhelming and I woke up soon after.

Besides the obvious fact that I miss him and wish things were different, I feel like there’s something to this dream. It came out of the blue, haven’t spoken to or about ex best friend in a while. Would love some insight please. Thanks in advance. And let me know if you need more info, clarification, etc.

First dream happened the night before last. His family had a gathering at his grandparents house (that didn't look like his grandparents house). His uncle is the important person in this dream. For some reason, his uncle said something that made me suspicious, so I went to his room where I found a dead man eviscerated and hung up in his closet. I felt sick and almost passed out. The dream then jumps to him telling us that he had a gay lover that he killed, and it wasn't his first. He goes to jail. The dream skips again to the next holiday get-together. For some reason, he's there. I'm shocked and upset, and the dream ended with me asking, ""Why isn't he in jail? I thought he was in jail!""
This was a VERY realistic dream. I could smell the blood and feel the sweat on my forehead. The fear was visceral.

Second dream: this one is much more vague. Husband and I were staying at his mom's house (which, from what I can remember, looked much like his mom's house). We were playing board games with his younger siblings and just hanging out with his mom and dad. Sprinkled throughout the dream, however, were moments of me and his next youngest sibling (who is about to turn 19) being alone together. Two specific examples I can remember were right outside the bathroom door and in his bedroom (which I've never been in IRL). In these moments, we would be talking, then suddenly he'd 'adjust' and I'd notice (without looking) that he is... Erm, excited... I'd continue making eye contact until one of us walked away.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!",hot,Weird dreams about husband's family...,1.0

As well as that, he and some of the crew had gathered to take a look at something - a map I think, I never really saw it. Nor did I see their faces, so I couldn't say if they're real. Probably not, but regardless. The news title read something along the lines of ""IT'S HAPPENING... WAR BETWEEN GREECE TURKEY HAS BEGUN, RUN"". I think it would happen a few hours from then.

Notes: I felt so terrified myself. I actually couldn't tell whether or not I was having a dream, and I was aware of my surroundings.

There was absolutely nothing unrealistic or out of the ordinary about the dream, and that's a first for me. Even one other dream that felt as real had unrealistic things in it.

I was thinking to myself things like ""What will happen now? What do we do? How do we survive?"" Things like that. Normal, real reactions, right?

I haven't thought about war in forever. Nor do I think Greece and Turkey will engage in war (I live in Greece).

Just a little background, I am estranged from my toxic family and have been for several years. When my ex came into my life I was in the early stages of saving money to money out of state. But he and I fell blissfully in love and I decided to stay. 

The first three years of our relationship were amazing, loving, and fulfilling. I don’t recall a time where I ever had a nightmare while we were together. 

Long story short, we broke up (over rumors and lies created by his “friends” about me) but we’ve been off and on for the last year or so. 

The dreams I have about him vary. Sometimes he’s just in the house, staring at me.... but there are times I have nightmares about my ex murdering the new guy I have a crush on. 

Last night, my ex wasn’t in my dream but we had a terrible fight that same night. 

I dreamt I was at a basketball game with my best friend and my daughter [12] (not my ex’s kid) and when it was time to leave, I somehow got left behind. 

I spent what seemed like hours searching for them and my calls went unanswered. I somehow ended up roaming around a lively hospital.  All the staff were kind and helpful and I found myself in an unaccompanied room. Waiting. 

I began to get restless and took a lap around the hospital where I ran into my boss from work. Lol completely out of place, she gave me some files to work on over the weekend and I lied and said I was thrilled to get started. 

When i opened the files, it was a typed up screen play, out of order........ I don’t write at work. Writing is a side passion of mine. 

I get back to my “room” and one of the nurses comes in to ask if I need anything. I say no, and she leaves. 

I try calling my friend one last time - in my dream it was 3:30 in the morning (i remember seeing the time on my phone) she answered. 

It was a FaceTime call so I could see she was with my kid and my other friend and they kept laughing at me.  Saying: Why would you get left behind? How could you get left behind? 

They thought it was hilarious. 

I woke up before I could be “rescued” in a state of confusion.

The elevator broke through the roof and fell back into the top floor and I got out.

I was greeted by that man who sent the letter and he repeatedly tried to shake my hand. I didnt want to touch anything and declined, saying I should wash my hands first. He tried covering his hand with his sleeve to reassure me and I kept refusing, and I saw his disapproval. 

There were a lot of people working on things and he and his secretary sat me down for a job interview, and they said I'd start work tomorrow after I signed the paper to which I replied ""no. I'm not signing anything and I never signed anything."" And the tone of the whole place changed. Everybody got very tense and nervous at my rejection.

So, a little bit of background regarding myself may be useful and important, or it may not. Either way, I feel that it is so just to be on the safe side of things...

I’m 27 years old, a very artistic Libra, a bookworm, and I’m a Wicca. I have been married to my husband for nearly six years and he is my best friend. We have three kids together aged three, two, and one. I love animals, video games, nature, and crystals. I am also socially awkward and a very strong empath. I live in the country out in the boonies.

This first dream that I’d like to talk about is one that I often have. I’m not sure about anything in the dream, only that it all seems very familiar to me.

At the very beginning of my dream, I’m always smiling and leaving my home to go somewhere. I’m with my husband and I’m telling my kids goodbye and that I’ll be back later. As we’re driving, my husband cuts down a back road that I recognize (it’s legitimately a road), and we pass an old, abandoned church. During this time, I begin feeling sick. A sour taste makes it’s way into my mouth. 
After a few moments, we pass an old house that looks abandoned and falling in. The next thing I know, I’m inside the house, and my husband is nowhere to be seen. The inside of the house is a wreck. There are dirt and stains everywhere, and it’s just disgusting. I suddenly see a very dirty little girl peeking at me from around a corner. I approach her, only for her to grab my hand and pull me to her room. She tells me that I have to hide, that daddy is coming and he’s not happy. I ask her what she means by that and all she says is that her mommy made him unhappy too. After begging me to hide, I crawl under her bed.
Suddenly, a large man barges into the room, a crazed, animalistic look in his eyes, and starts incoherently yelling at this little girl. He grabs her, and I hear her screaming, only for it to fade away. The next thing I see is a body of water ( I’m not sure if it’s a pool, a pond, etc) filled with rotted leaves and murky water. Pieces of logs and tree bark are submerged into the water as well, giving a swampy feel to it. As I’m staring into the depths of the water, a shape drifts into my sight underneath the surface. It’s a body, and it’s tattered. Imagine a pale, bloated person who has been drawn and quartered without their body actually completely tearing. That’s what this looked like. 
It was a woman, and though it was never confirmed, I know it was the mother of the little girl. She rises up out of the water (though I’m not sure how) and lets out an inhuman scream. All of a sudden, the monster man is across from me on the other side of the water, holding  the little girl in his arms. The mother looks at me with empty eye sockets and pleads with me to help, only I can’t move nor can I talk. A choke collar attached to a chain is placed on the little girl, which is then attached to a log. He tosses her into the water, and I see she is unconscious and bruised. Her mother is now going ballistic and screaming and crying. The man looks me dead in the eye and grins. I just know I’m next. As he stands up, I wake up.

So I went home for a holiday to spend time with parents and family. My great aunt was terminally ill and on her death bed. The last I saw was nearly two years ago and she looked fit and healthy but the illness has taken a toll on her and she looks unreconisable

Last weekend I had a dream about her and she told me to come see her on Monday. On Monday I went to visit her but her children had taken her to hospital just before we got there. 

I was flying back to the country that I lived in on Saturday so I went to visit her again this past Friday. My parents did not let me go into her room as the family was worried about her contracting something from outside as her immune system was failing. 

So I flew back home last night and went to bed when I landed. I dreamt about her and she looked like how I remembered her before she got sick and she was smiling and said she is okay now. I woke up and my mother had sent me a message to say that my great aunt just passed away.

Her funeral would be on a Monday (when she told me I must come and see her) but obviously I can't fly back on short notice as I just got home but she is in my thoughts.

five to seven times a month I dream that my house has been broken into or something similar. I haven't had my home broken into before, the worst that's happened to me is my amazon packages getting stolen off my doorstep. I'm 17, Female, ENTP type, living with my parents, in a pretty safe neighborhood- but every night I get these vivid dreams where my house gets broken into, or im stopped on my porch and my things are demanded. I write them down in my phone to see if there are any patterns but there aren't any. 

The two most recent examples are :

1. I was walking home from a school field trip ( no idea why, thats just how it was ) in an area that looked like my neighborhood but wasn't really ( cant explain why either- its a dream thing, you know? a highschool i didnt even go to was four houses down from mine. its across the city ). A car drove by my house but on the side walk, and outside my front door was a man with a laundry basket. I dont remember entirely what happened after first seeing him and getting inside my house, but I got in and locked the door. We have glass panneling on either side of my front door so we can see who comes up to our house and he shattered that with a stone  but did not come inside. After this, he demanded my brother's lunch box when he came home and then waited outside my house. I woke up after we (my brother, my mother, and me) were locked inside for several days. No clue where my dad was the whole time. Police were called but nothing came of it. 

2. This dream actually left me really shaken because sometimes in these dreams I get killed. Not all the time, but like a solid 40% of them end in a gunned down OP.  I was laying in bed in my dream, thinking I was awake when I a strange feeling of people being after me. I peeked out my window and saw a bright, cheeto dust orange, jeep creeping down the street outside my home. When I saw this car all I could feel was dread and I don't know why. I've never seen an orange jeep before; I dont even think they exist. Regardless, after I saw it drive away I went downstairs and ate breakfast with my mom. I remember going over to my couch to break up a fight between our two cats and then there was banging on my door. My mother looked startled and went to answer it but I hid behind the couch. There was a group of men claiming they were looking for me and she said I spent the night at a friends house. They left. The rest of the morning went by normally- I got dressed, packed my backpack, and headed off to school. My dad dropped me off and then BANG, outside the community center next to my school I was shot and killed. 

That one isn't quite home invasion-y but I woke up feeling hot but not sweaty, like I'd just been dipped in a hot bath and all my nerve endings are buzzing. It only lasts a few seconds but when I die its the same feeling every time. 

I have a lot of more classic ""im watching a movie and then theres people in my house and i hide in my closet"" or ""im in bed awake and someone comes in my room and i shoot them dead"" dreams too but the two above are ones I cant wrap my head around. I have no real enemies, no guilt relating to this, I havent stolen from anyone unless pencils count... I have these dreams virtually exclusively, all some how relating to myself in danger. Like, I'll be walking home from a friends house and suddenly im hiding in a dumpster trying to avoid getting found by some thugs with guns wanting to kill me, and I have to kill them first. I'm not a violent person at all- I love my friends and family dearly and I generally feel safe a majority of the time.

I was still dreaming when I awoke. As my eyes tried to pull themselves back closed I saw a creature on my ceiling.

It was the kind of thing that would normally frighten me into a desperate frenzy to wake up; this isn't new to me.

I felt calm this time. I wasn't afraid of the creature, which looked kind of like a [harvestman](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Opiliones.jpg) (daddy-long-legs to those in the US and Canada) with no body, just a bunch of spindly legs converging on one point at the center.

It wandered around in a small circular pattern, with each repetition of the pattern bringing it closer to me.

I wasn't afraid of it until I noticed that it was getting closer, I didn't want to find out why it was approaching.

I blinked a few times, but it was still there; usually these things disappear right away. I guess my residual dream state was particularly strong this morning.

Anyway, I know it's hard to interpret such a small fraction, but it's the only part of my really strange series of dreams that stayed with me. All I know beyond that is that the dreams that I had last night were weird, and mattered. I'm glad I had them, but only a small fragment stayed with me.

If anyone could help me understand the patterns surrounding spiders, legs and missing parts I'd really appreciate it. I know that there are mythical creatures that embody multiplicity-of-parts in various ways. The hecatoncheires have a multiplicity of hands and heads, and represent overwhelming natural forces like hurricanes. In Indian myth many spirits have a multiplicity of hands, representing potency. I can't find anything abut multiplicity of legs, though.

Personal attachments:
Spiders are symbols of craftsmanship in Celtic druidism, and I've always found that symbol appealing. When you destroy a spider's legs it doesn't lament its lot, or shake its fist at God, but begins construction anew, without hesitation.

This wasn't a spider though, I know that with certainty. If I had felt that it was a spider when I saw it, I would have allowed it to approach. This creature's approach made me uncomfortable, though I was fine with it at a distance.

It was made of legs. I don't feel as though I'm running away from anything right now; that was the first place I looked just thinking about what a bunch of legs could mean.

Any advice or guidance in my search for symbolic significance would be deeply appreciated.

EDIT:
I recognized it as similar to a harvestman immediately when I saw it. I know a lot about them, and have always been fond of them, but I didn't want to let this thing close; maybe I should have. Everything surrounding it implied that it was harmless; looking like an even less dangerous kind of arachnid (I already consider spiders to be woefully misunderstood, and welcome their presence in my home), having no features that could be used for harm (literally only legs, not even feet).",hot,Dream creature - seen *upon waking* through heavy eyes,1.0

That's when my niece steps in the front of the bus. I scream at the bus driver to stop so that I can confront my niece and see what is going on. She then tells me that the back tire of her motorcycle popped and she sustained a major injury to her ankle. She requested that I take her to the hospital. As I help her get on the bus, I notice that the turn into the corridor was going to be extremely tight and the bus driver may not be able to complete the turn without hitting the wall.

Back in December I had a dream that had three main points that i remember to great detail. The three main points of this dream are as followed: an elderly lady jumped in front of me grabbing her heart then proceeding to fall to the floor dead, next a lady who loves hair walked me through a crowd of people where we were laughing and having a great time, and finally i was in an heighten mental state where it felt like i was finally happy and carefree.

 About a week later, my grandmother passed away unexpectedly due to heart problems which later the doctors told us she had a heart attack. During this time i did not my any connections to my dream a week earlier because of the time spent with family. One day at work the connection to the part of my dream and life became clear to me where i went start to the coworker that knew about my dream to tell them about this connection. This connection was made two weeks after having the dream and one week after my grandmother passing away. After making that connection to my dream and events in my life i recalled the dream to see if anything else had happened that might be connected. Little did i know, all three main points in my dream had happened in my life a week after having the dream. Christmas Eve night i was at the local bar where i began talking to a woman, that night we share laughs, danced, and just had a good time. Then the next day i got a text from her telling me that she had a dream about me coming to get my haircut at the salon she works at. Also on Christmas Eve, i decided to try ecstasy for the first time. This made me feel very happy, especially have mourning the lost of my grandmother a few days before Christmas, made me carefree and also caused me to dance at the bar.

 The events in my dream had a weird time frame where it went from the old lady having heart problems to what felt like a few hours then i met the lady who works with hair than to a few minutes to me being happy and carefree. 

I am telling this story because i have had another dream in the exact same format, time frame, remember the main events, and it too had one negative event and two positive events. It currently has only be a few days since the dream so nothing has happened that i can make connections to my life events yet.

Last night I was woken twice by a dream.

The first time I was in my back yard. The yard had a chain link fence running the perimeter. In one of the back corners, a large green(midsummer) tree was standing very tall(there are no trees in my yard). the roots of the trees were thick, and intertwined. Under one of the roots was a recess where some bees had made a nest. As I got closer I saw that the hole was very large(basketball) and could see the bees down to the inside of the nest. I felt fear, and then I woke up.

&#x200B;

Started out that I was in line for the ticket counter at the train station at my university.  I remember being annoyed because the lines are always long and the ticket people super slow.  A girl in front of me asked how to find her train and I told her that there were two platforms and to look for the name of the rail on the platform, and that it happens by student number (which is totally untrue?).  I heard the girls behind me laughing at me and I quickly corrected myself.  I soon got near the front of the line and Gene Simmons was in front of me.  He ordered a ticket to a Weezer concert and I thought ""woah, Gene Simmons is going to a Weezer concert so I should go too!""  I got to the front and ordered a ticket for the concert but realized when I got the stub that it had put me out $183.00 so I started trying to figure out how to return it.

&#x200B;

Not sure if at this point I had a different dream or if there is some weird series of events that connected these two, but I was in a modern-style apartment with all white furniture, floors, etc.  I was me but I also felt like I was Louise Belcher from Bob's Burgers which is kind of hilarious.  But I remember talking to this weird ass lady and for some reason she just lost her shit and started to freak out.  She ran into the corner of the living room where there was a fire engine red open coffin and while she was laughing maniacally she started turning this crank which started an engine which then caused blades beneath the coffin to start to turn.  I then realized there was a body inside the coffin that was getting sucked into the blade and there were severed body parts falling into the space beneath the coffin.  A pair of legs in strappy heels eventually stuck straight out of the top of the coffin, gradually descending into the coffin as the blades ate more and more of the body while the woman continued screaming and laughing.  Understandably, I freaked out and turned away, sprinting into the bathroom to hyperventilate.

&#x200B;

I splashed water on my face to calm down, looking into the mirror to try to ground myself when a humanoid creature appeared behind me in the mirror.  It resembled a person but the eyes were round and wide set and the creature was bald (think of Splice, that's that closest resemblance).  It looked like a woman.  I quickly turned around and nothing was there, but when I turned back she was still in the mirror.  She looked me in the eye in the mirror and explained, ""I am a being from the void.""

This thing looked like a sort of black humanoid mass and didn’t really have any facial features. I remember immediately knowing it was the devil ( it didn’t tell me this, but I knew for some reason). 

At first it wouldn’t talk to me and just sit across from me, but after a few dreams it started talking to me. I have no clue what it said, but I remember being terrified as well as very interested at the same time. This dream came back for a really long time and then it just stopped. 

I have no clue why I had this dream and was wondering if anyone could tell me more? ",hot,The weird reoccurring dreams from when I was six,3.0

Back story: I work in a toxic workplace. I hate where I work. I want to quit to pursue my mental health, school and photography business. I prayed to God if its the right path, if quitting will be a good idea. How I'm scared of failing, how it could be a mistake. I just wanted to know if I should do it. How I was scared of what people will think of me too. This was last week.

Last night, I dreamt about being on vacation with a lot of blue water. There was a huge rock in the middle of the water (Like a beach somewhat.) My fiance and I swam over there for a minute or so. We left and as we came back, I saw a man and woman in the same area playing with a bright yellow python. It was fairly large. I was absolutely terrified and bummed for some reason. The guy was playing with it like no big deal. 

That's all I could recall. My only concern is I was watching a TV show that had a black snake with an apple a few days ago so I hope it didnt stem from that.  ",hot,Yellow Python Dream,3.0

A lot happened in it, but the tail end of it just before waking up started with me leaving this gaudy room, almost like the bunker in Dark, and stepping outside to be confronted by a massive snake. I was then forced to decide if I wanted to return to the room and shoot Hitler or face the snake, so I ran back to the room to kill Hitler and then suddenly I was Hitler and I couldn’t load the gun, and then the snake waited outside the door, and I realized I had no choice and I had to go out to see the snake.

Then I was me again, and I was out trying to work out how to load the gun and shoot the snake when the gun turned into a tube that actually allowed this white structure to inflate, and I was inside the structure, it was more or less like a square room with a pole at the center and the snake started to wind its way up the pole, and I started to wonder if I could just stay with the snake, but then thought it would kill me in the night so I had to kill it first.

Then suddenly a figure appeared at the entrance of the structure and started to release these electric shocks, I suppose more like lightning, very bright and strong flashes of light. 

And then I woke up. 

For some context, I have been rather anxious lately as I wait to hear back about my PhD applications. I have also studied both Freud and Jung’s perspectives on dream interpretation. 

Additionally, I am ware that I often feel that I am failing at doing everything I need to do. I work a full time job to save money for my doctorate studies and I also a part-time research job that I care about a lot, but struggle to manage my time around. In addition to that I am trying to get some of my work published and maintain my health, so I often feel overwhelmed and like I’m not doing enough. This has been pretty much always been a core aspect of my personality. 

For further context, I am 25 and female. I have a good relationship with my family, lots of friends, and a great SO, although we are long distance at the moment. I don’t know if any of that helps, but I know context can be important for interpretation.

0.0,adolbj,4.0,2.0,"Hey guys! This is my first ever time posting on Reddit and I thought, what's better than getting some insight to my weird dreams that started a couple summers ago. This might be a little long, sorry in advance!!

Just to kick this off, I'm 22, female, kind of a shy person (trying to be more social though), and currently single/trying to date around a bit haha.

So back in late summer 2017, I started having dreams every night that were extremely detailed and vivid. They always included this group of people that I don't know in real life, but was very close with in this dream world. 3 girls, and one guy who was always a super prominent figure/lover kind of character. We always would be working in this bar in an unknown city. But the story lines would differ slightly night to night. After a while, the dreams stopped for a long time.

Fast forward to right now. The past couple nights, this man (who before was referred to as ""Jake"") and the girls have popped back up in my dreams. 

The first dream I had involved 'Jake' and I looking around this farm/warehouse area for a pug puppy and a new cellphone for me, but we left with nothing. He drove us back to the bar down this long city road, and I could hear the girls' voices telling me how great he is/how much he cares for me. I spilled a drink in the car, and while cleaning it I found a weird note that alluded to a mental illness he was hiding. The dream then cut to us about to ""do the deed"", and jumped again to me texting one of the girls how amazing it felt to finally have this with him.

The second dream was a little bit different. It involved me cheering these runners doing a marathon in the forest as they crossed the finish line, and I believe 'Jake' was somewhere in the beginning or middle of the race doing the same thing. Then it jumped to us after a ""session"" of our own, and we were sat/laid on my living room floor. He was displaying frustrations and being upset about something going on with the race, and I was trying to console him and rubbing his back/holding his hand to make him feel better. And I looked at our reflection in the window of my computer tower, and watched it as we leaned in to kiss each other. For some reason I peeked at him as we were kissing, and his eyes were wide open and he just looked super frantic/lost in thought. It just got heavier and led to more, though. Cut to the next part, and we were re-doing the same run. I feel sorry for those people now lmao.

If you want any more information, just let me know! :) Hopefully I can get some info out of sharing this weird yet cool dream series haha.

TL;DR: Having dreams about a specific guy and girls for over a year now on and off. I haven't met these people or recognize them from my real life. The guy seems to be a romantic partner in my life, wondering what my conscience is telling me about this.

0.0,adhkn3,0.0,2.0,"I'll start by saying that im not either religious and that i wasn't under the influence when i  had this dream.

Basically, the dream starts with me, a girl (im not a biological girl, but because of gender dysphoria, this happens in dreams sometimes) standing in a long dark street in the night.
There's a building, which for some reasons is completely dark: i had to pull out my phone and use it as a flashlight.
I reach the end of it and there are two doors: one is a christian church, the other one seems (i knew it without even opening it) to be a place of worship for muslims.
I decide to open the church's door and as soon as i got closer, someone opened it for me: it was a kid, dressed in white, light brown hair and piercing blue eyes; like literally, his expression was stiff and it was really creepy.
I remember walking closer and seeing him open the door a little more, the taking a few steps back and he suddenly pushed it to close it: i did this for a while, as if i was playinh with him, untill i finally decided to enter the church.

As with the building, it was completely dark, aside from a huge church window which i didn't look at it for some reasons.
It was populated by a church ""teacher"", which was a lady with glasses and curly hair and a bunch of kids following her lesson. She also seemed to be able to phase in and out of existance, since she could reach a position closer to mine and go back to the altar in a blink.

This is where it gets weird: i got bored and i've decided to draw a cat girl with a huge butt on the floor. Yeah, it was literally a girl, with cat ears and a huge butt. 
The church girl decides to go downstairs through a long circular with a bright red light coming from the bottom: she tells the kids to follow her.

Since i was out of her line of sight, i decided to leave. On the corridor, i keep turning back toward the other door and i remember feeling a strong sexual presence there: i didn't enter though and i kept going for the exit door.
Sudddenly i froze and i was wandering in the dark; i heard a voice: ""hey babe, what happened? got too frisky?""
Not sure if he said ""frisky"" or something else, but it was something like that. 
I replied that i was bored and i've decided to leave: as soon as i open the exit door, he literally spawns a car in there, as if it was a videogame, drives through the door and breaks the building front face. 

The car was weird, it looked like something out of Nascar races and also reminded me of Cars, the cartoon movie, despite the fact that i've never watched it. 
I decide to enter the car.

As soon as we begin to drive away from the building, we hear LOUD screams, terrible and agony filled screams coming from it: he keeps on insisting that we have to go back to check, but i simply tell him that we have to call the police, because whatever is in there, if he's making and entire group scream like that, it's probably going to kill us too.
After a while he decides to call the police, but meanwhile, everything has turned into a really blurred, poorly draw comic. (think of chris-chan comics for reference)
Screams got louder and distorted for every comic pannel that flashed before my eyes, untill i see a really realistic movie like SWAT squad entering the building.

A really poorly draw cartoon dog with a melted face pops out: they say that it was just the ""results dog"" crying about his ""results""; what they actually meant by ""results"" it's actually school grades. 

The dog barks at me and i wake up with..lots of questions.

We dream that we've killed someone and buried the body. We go on our lives as normal. But then someone comes about and starts asking questions. Where is so-and-so? You were last seen with them, do you know where they went? We're worried about them.

So the police will start snooping around and suddenly, we know that we're most likely be caught. And that's when things start to feel really real. For my dad, he'll wake up immediately and lie in bed really worrying about it - thinking that he's actually killed someone and that the police are going to knock on our door any minute. It takes him a minute or so to convince himself/remember that it was in fact all a dream.

This sometimes happens to me but more than likely, I'll continue sleeping until morning but when I wake, it'll be with this severe feeling of unease - like I've done something very very wrong but can't quite put my finger on it. This dream happened last night - it's evening now and I've only just remembered why I felt this way this morning.

Just for clarity, we never have these dreams on the same night - we experience them quite separately from each other. We're also never in each others dreams.

For myself, usually it's just one person I've killed but last night, it was about five people. I've always been a solo killer but occasionally, I'll have one/two people help bury the body/bodies with me. I also can't really ever remember who the person I've killed is, and dad is the same.

The most common theme is dead kittens. Dozens if not hundreds of dead kittens around the place. They all look horribly realistic and I know that I'm the reason they died slowly and painfully. Either I didn't feed them, or they froze to death, something like that.

Dogs and puppies usually show up dying instead of fully dead. But there's still that knowledge that it's all my fault, and there's nothing I can do to save them or ease their pain.

The last couple dreams were lucid. As soon as I realized they weren’t real life because my mom is dead, I focused on trying to talk to her. I think because I wish I talked to her more... but we had a somewhat awkward, Asian family relationship. I never told her in person that I love her. I only said it once through text right after I found out the diagnosis.

A figure that looked like my dad came in and spoke to me in some weird language that sounded like Korean but wasn’t. I was lucid so I was actively trying to determine what language it was. It sounded like my dad’s nagging though. He leaned over and reached his hand out to grab/slap(?) my dog’s butt, who was sleeping with her butt in face. At the exact same moment I woke up to my dog mildly freaking out and jerking her butt, then going to sleep. My heart beat really fast and I checked it wasn’t me. My arms were firmly by my side, stuck under my dog, so it wasn’t me... My dog is a one-person dog and followed my mom around everywhere. My mom treated my dog as if she’s my little sister.

I went back to sleep fast because I was so sleepy... and honestly scared and wanted to hide in my dreams again. When I woke up I told my boyfriend what happened and for the rest of the day I was in a really good, productive mood. I think I finally snapped out of depression. Idfk what happened, but I hope my dream meant something. I hope she was trying to tell me something. ",hot,A series of dreams about my mom after she died. Last dream was a sign?,1.0

My mom doesn't want me to talk to him or about him but I recently found out that my mom abused him and he was only 19 when he had me and my mom was 25. And uhhh my birthday is coming up. 

In my dream I was in one of those indoor hotel venues with all the rows of seats and a stage. Like remember that movie called Witches where they had their big meeting about turning kids into mice? It was like one of those.

So at the center stage was a throne and I had to sit there naked with a big cheesy stereotypical pointy crown and I wasnt allowed to get up.

And in all the seats were my friends and family singing some weird choir song in unison and when they were done they told me happy birthday and got up and enjoyed this banquet at the opposite side of the venue and everyone was enjoying themselves and I had to sit there and watch all hungry, and even if I wanted to break the rules and get up to eat I just couldn't move.
What's worse is I started to hear my dad banging on the door yelling for someone to let him in. And I was crying and I was asking someone to let him in and they ignored me. And this is my dad and I love him more than anything and he's super sweet and all I want to do is hug him...

     It starts off with me in my room with white walls and my bed with a big fluffy blue blanket. I'm under the sheets giggling with someone and I can't see his face. I jump out of bed and climb slowly into an open overhead crawl space and I make it to the next room where there is a much bigger king size bed, and for some reason my brother is laying there. I crawl out and I grab something from the room and he asked me ""where are you going?"" ""What's so good about him-why are staying with him?!!!"" His face was getting bigger and more red with rage as he spoke but all the nerves in my body stayed calm, and I said something I don't quite remember and I crawled back through the overhead and crawled into bed again. 
      When I crawled back into bed and snuggled back in underneath the blankets, I was laying on my back and then the man I was laying next to pulls the blankets off his face and yells ""a-ha!""  In a surprise tone. His long light brown hair is nappy and flowing everywhere in wavy curls that fall ever so lightly onto his pale skin making his bright pink lips stick out. As my head turns and I make eye contact with his golden eyes he expresses this beautiful smile and laugh that literally makes my heart do a tribal dance of joy and then we lay there staying into each other's eyes and giggling and holding each other and it feels like we're the only people in the whole world. 
    The room seems to start shaking and my brother burst open the door and says ""Did he tell you!? Did he tell you he was leaving?!!?"" He was a volcano so close to erupting but something about those words made me turn my head and look at ""my love"" with astonishment of a high degree of betrayal. I leaped out of bed my shorts turned to jeans and my undershirt into a loose fitting shirt with a dark jacket. I start running out of the room and he's calling my name and starts chasing me. 
     The location shifts and the sky is a foggy medium gray that cascades over a beach and these huge scattered black rocks with water still sliding down on all sides. 
      Before I enter the building I am jogging and right before you breach the beach there is a band that's playing. They're punk rock/metal attire and their music is playing overhead and is very loud. I enter the building where there are so many people running and shouting the beat of the song. Everyone is dressed in black and like has chain on their clothes and wallets and they all have these huge beards and long hair and they are jumping/running/shouting in unison down the hallway and to the right of them are huge windows without glass in them that allows you to see the dark sky and the black rocks and the beach ever so clearly. 
      I have dried tears on my face and I am completely intrigued by what I am seeing and in my left hand I have a fallout lunchbox that has the same vault opening as the game and when you open it it's playing the same song they are singing. Then these 5 people, sort of like bodyguards, busted open 2 doors to the left of the hallway and pushed me inside and held their hands out around me like I was a fragile valuable treasure. 
     Then I saw him ""my love"", the beautiful man with his sexy soft pink lips and his tall comforting body with his delightful wavy hair just below his shoulders. He was wearing dark almost black blue jeans and a dark green jacket. He's running with the crowd but instead of singing with them his eyes glow with worry as he searches for me. He leans back against the wall right at the edge of the door and his head is moving with his eyes but his lips give this smirk of approval for the people rushing down the hall and singing as if he's been waiting for this day for a while and it had finally arrived. I was watching everything kind of in slow motion and I stare at him with longing in my eyes because while he's standing there looking for me straight ahead if all he did was turn his body around he would see that i was right there waiting for him, reaching for him, begging for him to grab me and never let me go. When I think about the warmth I would get from being pressed up against him and the dance my nerves would do to kiss him and my heart being attached to his I become exuberant and I feel lucky and sad all at the same time. Right before my dream ends it shows hundreds of people rushing into the room forcing themselves into these 2 elevators in the back of the room. The dream cuts out there. 
    Lately the part where he's standing at the door looking for me in the crowd while I stare at him from behind has been playing in my head over and over again and at random times during the day. I don't know what it means. I don't know who he is. But I sort of feel like I am destined to meet him. I want to. Hopefully you could give me a bit more clarity. Thank you for listening!

The leader wants me to give the cop electroshock therapy. The officer is sitting on the floor, back against a wall. I'm supposed to use these two suction cups on a string to pin his head back, but the suction cups won't stick to the wall.

I really don't want to do this, but the leader is insisting. He had electroshock, so he wants to get revenge by making a cop have electroshock. I somehow manage to distract the leader -- our little white dog runs away, and I point this out. They all take off after the dog, down a hospital corridor, leaving me alone with the cop.

Now's my chance. I throw all the electroshock equipment out a window. To the cop, I say, ""Make a run for it.""  And he does.

Then I make a run for it too, leaving the hospital and my crew. I walk along the streets and eventually run away.

Later, still dreaming, I realize all of this was too crazy to be real. It was a dream. I'm walking along and I meet the leader again.

""Hey, I had the craziest dream about you,"" I said.

""I know,"" he replies. He names a mutual friend we have who told him all about it. (I guess I must have told her about it.) Then he attacks me, furiously.

I fend him off. ""Are you really mad for something that happened in a dream?""

""Yes, I am.""

We continue to fight. At one point he almost manages to throw me on some railway tracks, but I manage to break free and escape him.

I run around some more, baffled. Why would he be so upset about something that happened in a dream? I'm also somewhat confused as to who he is, to me. A friend? An acquaintance?

Some interpretation: the police show up in my dreams as the superego all the time. A kind of social conformity force that stops any ""deviant"" behavior. Which maybe makes the drug stealing leader the id. And he's upset that he's been subdued by electroshock so many times. Now it's his time to subdue the superego. But I can't allow that.

Two of them got away, the third one I smashed, but it kept moving and regenerating/healing at an alarming rate. At some point I gave up trying to kill it and put it in a transparent but cloth sack instead, in which I held a certain way so it couldn’t bite me. Throughout the dream it also seemed to grow in size. This spider was immensely fast and because I couldn’t kill it I chopped off its leg with a knife, occasionally releasing it so I could study it. I’m not sure why I kept doing this. I’d chop it’s legs off, look at it, then put it back before its legs grew back. It’s legs wouldn’t grow back instantly, they would  grow very steady but at a fast rate. This kept repeating.

It's not exactly the same each time, but it always starts in a series of white-painted rooms, simply designed with uncomfortable wooden furniture. There's a small black child who's always with me. He's a sweet kid. He never talks, but I know he's sweet and that I have to take care of him. 

There's an old man too, somewhere in the endless series of rooms (it feels like ages to travel anywhere). Every day, I have to go see him. He gives me food for the kid, and helps me make sure he's clothed. 

But there's a catch. There's a thing in the rooms. Old and powerful, and hungry. We worship it in a way, although it's more like fear and appeasement. I have to find people in the rooms to give to the thing. 

Unfortunately, this day that I'm dreaming of, I can't find anyone. And I have to come up with someone. It's getting late and the thing is coming. As I'm looking, everywhere I go, I can see it in dark corners and out of the corner of my eye. Long fingers with sharp, steel nails. A bony, cracked body. A stick-like head with a stretched out, distorted face that never stops screaming. 

No matter what I do, I can't find anyone. And it's coming for the kid. I can hear it. I can see it. And as it goes for the kid, things diverge. 

In the first dream, the kid died in a horribly gruesome way. In the second, the old man manages to stop it and we win, somehow. In the third, this last one, I block it with my body, and it tears my head off my body with terrible strength.

Context: 

I woke up from a very intense dream a bit ago and I can quite understand it. i had been out for NYE last night, and this was my first dream of 2019. I will say, I am a very intuitive and spiritual person, and I always dream. Most of my dreams are unlike reality (i.e. shifting spaces and faces), but they feel like reality when I am in them. I can also lucid dream to a small degree.

&#x200B;

What I can remember:

In my dream I’m in some sort of foreign place. There are lots of levels and I’m running around almost in a loop. I keep meeting people that I think I have seen before -- i'm convinced that I know them but also know that i don't. This one man is shepherding me around. His face starts shifting from one thing to another. From “his own” to an animal or another human face, just as he's talking and guiding me. He’s trying to impart wisdom on me and I can feel it. At one point I’m walking in a loop around an area where there is a newsstand he is trying to express a deeper message to me. At another point when I’m in the lower/basement area of the loop I meet this one woman with short black hair. She pulls me by my shirt in and says “You have seen me before. Pay attention. Shed light on the darker parts of people.” She then pinches me very hard in my lower right stomach and then leaves. Then another random stranger meets me and says something similar. Then he pinches me very hard in my lower right stomach. It’s as if each stranger I meet that wants to impress upon me that I have seen them before and also tell me something of importance and pinches me.  

At some point I transition to new scenery following this guy. It’s a combo between my apartment complex — of which I share with only one other person — and it’s got everything. it feels incredibly expansive and large. At first I’m there examining my room — this weird blue fur stuff I have on the wall is damaged from movers -- its evident that I'm moving somewhere. 

I start looping — running around again. Then the old shepherd man gestures me to follow him away from the looped location and brings me to a train. He brings me away from all these other people I’m trying to learn from. When i walk on the train, I see a familiar face reading a newspaper -- A guy I went on one date with. (backstory: I met this guy at an international photography workshop and was magnetized to his energy -- he lives in LA, I live in NYC. we talk every now and then and I think of him often, but nothing is happening there)  The shepherd man looks at me and smiles. When I see this guy, we start talking. And I see he had just texted me before i came upon him on the train and he had asked if I wanted to ride bikes around NYC for New Year’s Day.  he would be in town on a social documentary project for a bit. We get off the train and i bring him back to the other looped location. We hug for a long time. I’m very happy to be with him. His energy feels warm but unexplored. We start talking about photography. He tells me he really likes what I’ve been posting lately, that he didn’t like my old format and this is better. Then a coworker of mine shows up and she’s trying to tell me he’s a good guy to hang out with. I feel cautious because I want to know if he likes me.

0.0,abif8d,2.0,3.0,"I was on a train, sitting in the window seat on the left-hand side. If you’ve ever been on public transportation in Norway you know that people really are in their own little bubble. So I was lazily looking straight ahead into the seat in front of me, not thinking about the other passangers at all, while waiting for the train to reach where I grew up (there were two stations to go, and all the station names and scenery matched real life). I look slowly behind me, and there, two rows back on the aisle-seat on the other side, an incredibly beautiful woman is leaning far forward in her seat towards me, staring intensely at me, her eyes wide open. I really startle, as I realize she has been staring at me all the while I was minding my own business. And she won’t look away! I turn back forward, and back to her, but she never looks away and never blinks. It’s really scary!
She is a girl I used to know. When I was about 16 (I’m now 26) we had this common friend, and we talked a lot on Facebook though we only met once in real life. She had a boyfriend, but was always very nice and friendly with me (a somewhat unpopular kid), and even sent me sweet messages on Valentine’s day. I admitted after a while that I had feelings for her, and though we remained friendly we slowly grew apart.
So there we are on the train, and I’m feeling really scared but also this intense sense of love. She is letting me stare into her eyes, and when I do I get this overwhelming feeling of beauty and love, so overwhelming that I get even more scared and have to look away. But she still lets me look, and that also make me gratefull. We do this for a while, before she get up and moves up to the head of the train. I’m conflicted of what I’m going to do. Her beauty makes me want to talk to her, but she also scares me and seem very unstable (I have always had a weekness for beautiful women and often overlook that they are not good girlfriend-material, therefore both my exes are really pretty but also not the easiest to talk to.) When she returns to her seat I stop her and ask if I can have her number, and that I would like to hang out with her. She smiles and says «You already know where to find me.» And then I wake up.

Two additional thoughts:
1) There is a quote by Joseph Campbell I’ve been thinking a lot about lately. It goes something like «Where we had thought to have found an abomination we shall find a God.» I’m not religious, but I love the qoute because I’ve struggled with anxiety and know that if you look long enough at that which scared you the most, eventually it will disappeare and on the other side you will see something truly beautiful. I had that feeling when looking into the woman’s eyes.

2) Six months ago I moved to the far north of Norway to study. I’m happy I did, but it’s been really frustrating finding new friends, and no chance at all at finding a girlfriend. I have matured a lot in the type of girls I look for, and this dream seem to suggest to me that the really beautiful but scary women is what I should go for after all. It’s kinda confusing.

When it seemed like it was going to catch me an angel flew down from the sky, placed his hand on the head of the bear and it looked up at him and walked away. I thanked the angel and asked him his name and he told me he was Lucifer. He was at least 10 feet tall with massive bird like wings. He didn’t have horns or a tail, or anything about his appearance that looked evil like he is normally depicted with. I said that I had so many questions and he said he would answer them for me. The first question was what is god, and he said god was just like him, and the other angels. He told me that they were from another planet similar to earth. I asked him why god created everything, and he told that god didn’t create existence and god was born and would eventually die like everything. He said that their civilization had existed for millions of years and had learned how to manipulate and create new life. He said that although god didn’t make everything that he and the other angels were trying to spread life on planets throughout the universe and that god did create humans. I asked why god made us, and why he wanted us to worship him but he never showed himself to us on earth. He said god didn’t make us to worship him, he made us as slaves. I asked him why he would make us to be slaves if he was so powerful, and he said that he made us to harvest the resources from earth. Lucifer told me that he and some of the other angels felt bad for us since we were so similar to the angels so he gave us free will. God became furious with Lucifer and abandoned him and the other angels that defied him here on earth. At this point in the dream I was in complete shock and confusion. I thought he might be lying to me, given how he is described in the Bible. But I couldn’t see how telling me any of this would help him with any evil purpose. I asked him if there was life after death and he said no. He said that he and god would die eventually like everything else but they were able to live for thousands of years through technology. He told me that after god abandoned us here he had none of the tools or technology to escape so he decided to try to protect us and preserve life on earth. He said that a disaster was coming and that we needed to build a structure to keep humanity safe until it was over and he would show us how to build it.

I've never posted any of my dreams and I rarely even tell others about them, but maybe half a dozen times a year, I have dreams like this one. Extremely vivid, extremely long, and insanely detailed.

&#x200B;

I have the impression that I was called to this world as an intermediary of sorts but for some reason, at one point, I had a sniper rifle in my hands. I am pretty sure I was a journalist and the idea was for me to get the whole scope of the conflict, hear the story of both sides, and help, eventually, to facilitate some kind of ceasefire or end to the rebellion.

Basically, I gathered that this started out as some kind of political disagreement between two parties. Rather than eventually reach some kind of solution, both sides eventually just dug in and refused to give ground. I can't remember exactly what the core disagreement was over, but I ended up feeling pretty strongly that the ""guerillas"" were being for more conceding and willing to let the whole thing stop, but the government wouldn't do it.

I came to this planet through some kind of portal. It was small and I only knew about it because I remembered that it happened within the dream. I didn't see it myself.

For most of the dream, I saw basically no difference between us humans here on Earth and the Cobra-People of...well, I don't know what their planet was called. I mean, they looked like people. At least, most of them did, most of the time. Until the end. I'll get there. I did see some kind of logo on a wall that made me think it was a symbol of their planet. It had a symbol that looked like stylized versions of the English letters ""TJ"" but I never heard the name spoken aloud. I don't remember the names of any of the people but I do have some kind of mental ""tags"" for them if that makes any sense and so I am going to assign them names to make this easier to understand.

Carlos was in charge, at least to some extent. There was another, middle aged male who seemed to be his equivalent in most respects but was less of an impactful presence. Let's call him Charles. I had a long conversation with Charles on their beautiful screened in porch on the back of the home I was being hosted in. Maybe the home belonged to Charles, I dunno. Anyway, Charles filled me on the history of the conflict. I remember feeling pretty strongly that he was doing his absolute best to be impartial, but, obviously, he was on the side of the resistance. The most distinct part of this conversation was the way I felt while we spoke and I was standing in the sun on the porch. I stood in a spot that felt nice and warm, and the blowing breeze was just the right temperature. The only way the planet itself seemed noticeably different from Earth was in the ""tint"" of how my eyes perceived everything. It was like...everything was slightly more saturated looking but also their were shadows and a sort of semi-darkness over everything too. It's insanely difficult for me to describe this and I don't think I'm doing a very good job of it. Everything just looked a bit off. Like there was a shadow over the world.

On my second day on TJ, Carlos was arrested by the secret police force of the government. Apparently, neither myself nor Carlos had the correct documentation to be in this place so I was made to hide in some kind of safe house in the neighborhood. I noticed the strange car arriving outside the house before anyone else as I was taking a leisurely stroll along the sidewalk . I warned him, but it didn't help for some reason.

I avoided capture.

The next day, someone I call Steve was the new leader since Carlos was likely not coming back. I stayed in this day and most of the people who were crashing there were out and about. Somehow, suddenly, there was another human being there with me. That was Tim. I think he might have been some kind of support staff type guy for me. Maybe a photographer or camera man. Tim got sick somehow, I don't know how. And there was only one Cobra-Person there with us. I'm gonna call her Karen because she was a mega-bitch of ultimate proportions. Her asshole level was over 9000 is what I'm saying. I was sitting in the small kitchen table area with Karen. She got angry. Like really angry. Her face started to change. She looked grey and snake like and then scaly but like with grey rocks...This is even harder to describe than anything else. She continued to transform. Eventually she had multiple vertical appendages, some stalk like things came out of her chest, and she seemed to have multiple small heads and one large one that looked like a shiny purple cobra. It was fucking terrifying. She bit Tim at this point, multiple times, and the worst part is Tim wasn't even awake. He seemed to be in some kind of semi-coma like state where he was unresponsive to the stimulus. Apparently, these people have venom in their bites, but the weird thing is that the venom has to be applied to each bite from the stalks on their chests. Like, in between bites, she rubbed the stalks on her teeth and tongues. Then she bit me multiple times.

I passed out. When I woke up, an indeterminate amount of time later, everyone who lived/crashed here was back. I went to Steve immediately, but for some reason, I smashed every TV I could find on the way. I have no idea why, but I think I thought that the reflective surface was necessary for Karen's full transformation. Again. I don't know why.

I told Steve and his girlfriend, Vicky, about what happened. They told me I likely would survive. I had woken up, after all, and I was in good health before the bite. Apparently, it wasn't as effective against humans for some reason. Tim, however, was in jeopardy. He was already sick. He was probably going to die. I was mad as fuck. Karen burst into the room, clearly intent on attacking me. Vicky pulled out a snub nosed revolved of some kind and shot the fuck out of Karen, saying, and I quote, ""This is how we deal with these kinds of animals."" I think she was telling me that this transformation was not culturally acceptable any more. Or at least, that it wasn't considered decent to lose your shit on your guests and become vicious and predatory. Anyway, Steve pulled Karen's teeth out and gave them to me as a gift. He was crying and I was too. I apologized for my presence and the shit that seemed to have caused and he seemed to feel like I was not to feel guilt or an emotional burden from their perspective.  I'm not sure, but I think Tim died and that's why he gave me the teeth. I think it was something like a revenge token or something like that.

Somehow, and the timeline is fuzzy here, I did, at one point, participate in a battle with them. I know I've described them as guerillas and resistance fighters and that feels right. But this battle was like two forces meeting in a suburban setting. We, myself and the resistance, were outmanned and outgunned. I was passively observing at first with some binoculars but I crawled through some bushes and saw 3 snipers lying prone on a far off hill, perpendicular to my line of sight and I felt a strong call to do something before they slaughtered these people who had come to be my friends. I backtracked a bit to the group, grabbed a rifle that looked like an SV-98 with a bipod and bushrag, and one of their spotters came with me. I never got to try to use it against the snipers. We ran into a few soldiers in a house while trying to make our way back to the spot where I saw the snipers. I was forced to shoot the first soldier and the others disappeared (?) I guess. I don't know what happened there. Probably one of those pesky plot holes of a dream. That's all I remember of the battle and I don't know where it fits into the larger story.

EDIT: I am remembering a tiny bit more now. This battle had something to do with why Karen was angry. I still don't know why.

That's all I remember. I woke up and immediately started telling my girlfriend about it and I think that's why I remember so much. I don't care if this doesn't generate a discussion or whatever. I just feel a need to start getting these written down when they happen. As I said way up top, I have epic story style dreams like this 5 or 6 times a year.

Was inside a very large old building ca 100 x 100++ m, maybe a renaissance building with nobility or even royalty. I opened a door and walk into the next room which was ca 5 x 3 m with lots of broad walkways ca 2,5 m broad with walls covered in different sizes and colored gems, but all was 6 - 8 sided (not sure exact count)  
The gems ranged from ca 2 - 15 cm in diameter and that walkway I approached had white or yellow diamonds at the lower half (not sure exact color) then a dark line of gems at mid and lighter dark at top, but near the left conor at the beginning 1 m in there was a big square of ca 5 x 5 big ca 15 cm red gems. The line at the left side at the middle had gems that progressively got larger and in the middle had very 5 big yellow gems, then got smaller again as the line progressed.  


Then a woman/girl (?) approached me, she was flat like a cartoon but made of entirely gems, she was nobility/royalty (?) and very short ca 110 cm and levitated, the told me to leave in a language I didn't understand, which I did.

0.0,ab1s08,1.0,2.0,"I’m a FtM trans dude, strictly into women. When I was younger, I was a very devout Christian and didn’t realize what I was feeling was the same as what my church and parents were demonizing. 

Before I knew I was trans and before I put much thought into the fact that I liked women (or girls since I was a kid at the time, it seemed purely innocent so I didn’t make the connection that it was “homosexuality”) I had a  dream.

In this dream, I was at church, in one of those large baths/wooden tubs used for baptism. The priest wasn’t there and instead of being in the sanctuary it was in the church bathroom, open for public use for people that had already been baptized and just wanted to lay in holy water without anyone else present. I was sitting in that tub, when a very beautiful (rather busty though that’s not relevant) woman came in totally naked, and got in with me. I’m being indelicate when I say she was NOT there to be baptized. Only later on in life did I realize I was a boy in that dream. This happened around the age of 11 I think.

Now, the first nightmare I ever had. Or, the first nightmare that I can remember, at least. Boulders were falling from the sky, tornados were everywhere, there was loads of thunder and rain and I was trying to find shelter. I finally located the apartment building I lived in at the time, but when I opened the door, the apartment was entirely empty. All that was inside was one arm chair in the middle of an empty room, and in it, a gigantic adult-sized Barbie doll, totally naked, and absolutely sentient. I wanted cover from the storm knowing I’d die if I couldn’t find any. I wanted to seek refuge in that room, but after opening the door and seeing that doll I was terrified. She turned her head towards me, slowly, stood up in the most inhuman way, and then suddenly ran after me. I quickly slammed the door, And decided to look for cover elsewhere. I settled on hiding under a tree, hoping the branches would keep the boulders from crushing me. But then lightning struck the tree and it started to fall. I tried to run out from under it on time, but it crushed me before I could. Blood pooled out from under it and I woke up. 

I’m wondering if both of these things were foreshadowing who I am today. I lost my faith after realizing I was trans and that I liked women. I thought god had abandoned me and I thought it was unfair because I had been so loyal to him, why would he doom me to an existence I didn’t choose that would inevitably send me to hell? (I was taught that all trans and gay people go there.) The dream of me being seduced by that woman while getting baptized in holy water I feel like foreshadowed my realization that my faith contradicted the love I felt for women. Or maybe that the two can go hand in hand despite what I’d been taught? She looked like an absolute angel.

And as for the nightmare with the doll and the boulders falling from the sky, I think she might have symbolized something? I was trying to escape my death, this feeling of dread and impending doom, I was scared, and the thing that stopped me from saving myself was that Barbie doll; a figure I think symbolized femininity. She is what got me killed at the end of that dream. She is what drove me into the hands of death itself, I didn’t want to face her. IRL, I’d rather die than be forced to live femininely.

**Now, to the actual dream**: I remember a part that lasted a good while in which me and a friend of mine were riding a bicycle (I was behind, he was the one actually riding it. He has a motorbike and I've sometimes ridden with him irl) when all of a sudden my ex and a couple friends of hers appeared riding a bike as well and started chasing us. We kept riding faster and faster to try and get away from them, went through a couple villages (I vividly remember passing in front of an acquintance's house) and ended up taking the wrong exit in a roundabout, but leaving them behind (at this point, it kept getting darker until the night came around). This lead us to some town that doesn't exist in real life, though I remember reading the sign with its name and I think it could be an anagram of something in SMS language. Anyways, I saw that the town had a train station and I could head back home by catching a train, so I parted ways with my friend. The dream ended here, at least that I remember.

&#x200B;

I have some idea of what certain aspects could mean (that specific friend, my ex chasing us, me actually having fun with the chase, the night coming around...) but still, I think it was quite confusing and would love to read some of your ideas.

I was thinking in the dream I gotta be careful... I gotta be careful... then suddenly a sting got tangled on my elbow while I was on a moving vehicle and bam my right arm was cut off. Being a dream it didn’t hurt and I was like oh well gotta live like this now. So I grab my arm as I go to the hospital but I kept getting distracted that my arm was just a nub, idk but I found it cool for a while until I noticed I couldn’t reach for anything on the top of cabinets cuz I’m short and I was too lazy to use the left arm. But then I noticed hey I can’t write I’m a righty, so I was like that’s it! So I took my amputated arm with me to the hospital and I was like could you put it back? And they were like sure why not? So then I go to the operating table and I started at the doc straight in the eye and said “you better put it back right. I don’t want my thumb facing the wrong direction.” The doctor then responded don’t worry everything will be fine you can trust me. So I woke up and yup the thumb was facing the wrong side but I thought ehh it’s better than not having an arm plus it’ll make me more flexible. But then as I looked more at the arm I noticed that it was starting to decay. It must have been because i took so long, i think I took 3 days to get to hospital. Then as I looked at my decaying arm I said “well that’s not good... “ but i brushed it off because I didn’t care. But then as I examined the arm more and I noticed it wasn’t my arm but my brother... my brother was killed back in June, but I rather not talk about it because I’ll get sad and I don’t want anyone reading this to get sad... so yeah.. sorry for the awkward pause... I’ll go back to the dream... So yeah really weird dream... then the doctor came back but he didn’t want me to leave the hospital so I needed to plan an escape. But it didn’t work because the hospital was like a maze. Then i gave up and accepted the fact I was staying there, but I got worried about bills because hospitals stays are so expensive (also I don’t have medical insurance yet). then someone came over and gave me floss and I said oh cool thanks. But the floss was a black lace but ehh I don’t judge a gift is a gift. So later I flossed my teeth but they fell out. Well kinda. They kinda cracked and fell out in tiny pieces and idk how but my two front teeth split vertically and it hurt. And the left one had a pimple on it that beeped like a heart. Also it glowed a little. But yeah that dream was my third weirdest dream I had in my life... can anyone help get a meaning out of this? Also my mom thought it was funny but losing an arm isn’t nothing funny. Plus the part about my brother made me a bit sad so it’s a roller coaster of emotions. 

Finally, thank you for taking your time to read this and I’m really sorry if it weirded you out.",hot,A dream about a dead arm?,2.0

Falling is not something we seek for. Out of control, we are catapulted into a new state. Mysterious birth contractions forced us all out of the comfort of the wombs we fall into life. Fallin takes us down: from above to below, heaven to earth, the upper world to subterranean or watery depths. In my Nightmare was falling through the ice tunnels failing to reach the top where a light was shining. First was a futile attempt to climb upward by trying to grasp the opening in the ice walls, but the inevitable happens, I slip in I fall, descending into unknown. While tunnels certainly represent journeys, they more often symbolize the passage from one phase of life to another. In its most primal meaning, the tunnel symbolizes the birth canal. Just as a baby evolves and journeys outward, so do characters of a story. At the end of every tunnel is the other side, often bursting with light and hope. Equal to the journey is the outcome in its symbolic results. For me, the light was at the bottom of the abyss.

'' It wasn't a heavy sea - it was a sea gone mad! I suppose the end of the world will be something like that ..'' Joseph Conrad, The Secret Sharer
I was in water bottomless deep water, nothing but the distant expanse of the ocean after a storm. Dark and grey whit no sight of a light or a possibility to free myself. I was just swimming whit no direction. Ancient and primal the ocean is our mother of mothers, we are droplets in vast liquidity of the sea. Swimming returns us to our primordial origins in water. Darwinian evolution imagines life-formes beginning in water, floating than swimming, amphibian creatures who venture tentatively onto solid ground. The body has an instinctive resonance whit the sea of our beginnings, and the ego with the sealike depths of the psyche. But if we find ourselves into deep water then swimming may represent our only means to get the thing that can save us...a shipwreck

''...a brave vessel, who had, some noble creature in her, Dash'd all to pieces. Shakespeare, The Tempest.
''Shipwreck '' resonates in our terror of oblivion, of the absolute failure of containment in the encounter whit the seas of life and the frenzy of their winds and wawes. The central symbol of the feminine is the vessel as the womb. As the feminine figureheads on ships attest, the ship catches the projection of containing and protective womb. Shipwreck is felt, and feared, as maternal defeat or a broken womb. And on the shipwreck ( broken womb ) was a light. To see light in your dream represents illumination, clarity, guidance, plain understanding, and insight. Light is being shed on this broken vessel I swim towards it. Bright light is sometimes common for those who are near death, and I was feeling like I was dying. It is the light of consciousness that shines in every mind. Like traditional concepts of God, the light of consciousness is omnipresent. Whatever your experience, whatever you are thinking, perceiving, feeling, consciousness is always there. carl Jung had a phrase he took it from the alchemists: ''in sterquiliniis invenitur'' ''what you most want to find will be found where you least want to look'' And there at the bottom of the sea was my light and my savior my guide to the shore. If you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you said Friedrich Nietzche, but if you make the jump to the abyss of the unknown you will learn what you are capable of.
The dream ended whit me sailing away to the shore to the land of safety as the captain.",hot,"Falling in to abyss ... A half-baked writing I did today, trying to analyze a dream I have last night. Feel free to add some insight and suggestions for a name. Criticism is obviously welcome.",1.0

I could feel some sort of pulse emanating from my abdomen or stomach, and when I looked down I saw magnificent colored waves pulsating from my stomach and majestically soaring in circles out from me across the water, and cast a brilliant shine over the dark night. 

I heard some sort of noise and snapped my head to the right, meeting eyes with an owl on a branch high above me, staring down with it's head cocked as if pondering me, then it flew off suddenly without a peep.

2. The start of the dream I was laying in my bed and suddenly my best friend (callin her Melody for now.) Melody was also laying there. She was a tiny bit cuddled against me but not enough to where we were cuddling. We just looked at memes when suddenly we were now riding bikes together. Well she was riding a bike and I was riding a razor scooter with a seat. As we were riding we saw my other best friends Boyfriend waving to us outside what I assume was my imagination of his house. (We'll call him Derrick) Derrick led us into his house and we sat in his bedroom. When suddenly Melody suggested we go bike riding again. The thing about Derrick is that his girlfriend is very protective of him. Who is my best friend. So I decided in her place that me and Melody should trade places and I ride the bike and Derrick could sit on the back.
So road for a bit and suddenly Derrick fainted on the highway.  So we put him on the back of the bike and rode him home.
Next thing I know we're back in his room and Melody is sitting near the side of bed and I'm sitting at the foot of it. We were both looking at memes when Derrick woke up. I told Melody how it was late and I needed to get home and she told me I could ride the scooter home. I was supscious to leave her alone with him.
I mean I know Melody wouldn't do anything but I'm protective of Derrick For his girlfriend as well. 
But I eventually rode the scooter home and went back to my empty bed. After a minute Melody was back in the bed kinda but not really cuddling me.
 why was Derrick in my dream when in person I don't like talking to him much. (I don't like talking to my friends boyfriends cause I don't want them to get the wrong idea)

the dream, my mom and I were driving home through town when the sky became dark and we noticed several tornadoes forming.

Our car almost blew off the highway and he had to get off and go by foot. We slid down a pole and got home by walking through this storm.

I sleep. A lot. I even often wake up naturally and then desperately wanting to prolong the immersion of the dream continue sleeping. Proverbially wasting the day away, however I have read that sleeping a lot is also a symptom of major depression which I suffer from atm. 

To get to the meat of it, as long as I can remember my dreams have always had similar themes. Water, structures in disrepair, and the exploration of ruins. Not all of my dreams contain all three, but sometimes a dream may contain multiple themes mentioned. 

Sometimes I will have the same dream, or be in the same environment but being aware that it is happening again and so change my actions or reactions in the “do over” version of the dream..

I suppose it would help to describe one or two of the dreams themselves. 

The environment of my childhood home is flooded. The world looks the same, except there is about four foot of water all around, as if it has rained for many days in a row. The sky is always unnaturally bright, with large storm like clouds  on the horizon but the area beyond my porch being clear. There is an unnatural clarity to the stars, which are visible although the atmosphere gives the sensation that it is dusk. Or the sun is glowing beyond the heavy clouds. There is a visible planet with rings hanging low in the sky. An older style NASA rocket hurtles from behind my home, over the roof and impacts just far enough that the waves from the massive kinetic force settle without harming the structure of the home. I do not feel panic, but excitement and make my way toward the crash site. I never reach it before waking up. 

Again and again I find myself exploring submerged ruins. Sometimes of human and mechanical design (think massive submerged ships, or fallout style factories where you find mirelurks... ) Sometimes they’re flooded ruins similar to stone temples. Other times it’s literal under water caves, and never with any diving equipment. I always just manage to find a pocket of air at an opportune time. These dreams always have a level of excitement too, but usually reach a point of dread before I wake up. Often after someone joins me and needs rescuing or downright dies. 

The most mundane that occurs multiple times involves a beach landscape. (That I do not ever recall visiting in real life. It reminds me of a tropical village from some video game I played in my youth). It’s a beautiful ocean landscape one day that I am enjoying, but as the tide comes in so does a storm. I always enjoy this as well, but if I’m ever accompanied by anyone in my dreamscape they are terrified. The storm ends up being bad, but I ride it out and it’s marvelous and I feel alive. Keep in mind, that I’ve usually been swimming in/exploring the beach water during the entire dream.

The first dream took place in a public restroom. I think I was at some type of small location - a diner or a gas station, but in the dream, I was walking to the public restroom, and right when I walked in, I saw this woman with long, curly dark brown hair who wore black clothing and heels. I noticed that she had a large kitchen knife in her hand that was covered in blood, but she didn't seem to care that I just saw her. Somehow, I managed to look in the stall she was in, and saw a male sitting on the toilet with his hand on his stab wound that was located on his chest. He was still alive, but he didn't seem in distress. I think he had a white shirt on.

I can recall one bad dream I had a few days ago - I and someone else in my dream were at a location in a city that looked like it was on the verge of being in ruins. The unknown person and I were standing in front of a building - which looked like a building used for business or office jobs - that was on fire, but the flames seemed to be under control. The building wasn't completely burned to the ground, but it was pretty bad. The worst part, however, was that there were so many burnt bodies. There were so many of them leaning against (or even huddled up by) the large window from the ground floor, and maybe a couple scattered outside. I felt a sense of shock at the sight before I woke up.

The last dream happened this morning, actually. This one is a lot more vulgar, but I don't want to go into details. To sum it up, the dream involved animal abuse and bestiality. I remember crying and feeling so, so upset at what I saw with a sense of experiencing trauma or shock.

Just then Daniel walk out in full kink regalia -- boots, black kilt, leather harness, and some kind of really bizarre leather headdress, and eyeliner. And I was very appreciative. And he says come on, one of the back rooms is empty, but the matriarch catches him and makes him give her his debit card to pay for the room. But before she can swipe the card, an old asian man dressed only in one of those sumo loincloth things comes up to me and grabs my arm, but kind of in a doctorish way, I'm not alarmed. However, I am alarmed by the fact that the wound has now gotten huge, probably 5 inch diameter, and now you can see layers of thin film, like cyst wall skin, and you can see my muscles underneath.  He asks me if it hurts, and I say no, which is all of a sudden very alarming -- I should be in serious pain. The parlour people decide that immediate action is needed, because I am infested with something paranormal, but they won't explain it to me. They decide they need outside wisdom, so they pull down a wood box, spread out some flowers and some smoke, and channel someone who has one of ""the Books."" Apparently there are only a few left. They connect to an 11 year old girl who is in possession of a copy of The Book and begin to guide her through the Book and try to figure out what section they need to read from. And then I wake up because I'm scared and have serious anxiety that she's only  11 and I'm infested with a demon or something and how are we gonna get what we need out of an 11 year old across the world.

I’ve always been very conscious of the contents of my dreams that I remember and look for meaning in them. I’m usually successful on finding meaning myself, but this dream I just had has me uncertain and frankly disturbed and meaning I have found has left me paranoid. 

I’m a woman and 22 y/o

I want to preface that I’m a Christian and I believe God sends me messages in my dreams. Not like I’m some divine prophet, but to help me in my spiritual or mental journey. That being said, I’m not super religious and don’t go to church (I’m not pleased with the state of the church). Even though I don’t think it’s relevant, i feel i should add that recently my grandmother passed away and flared up my depression that I’d made incredible progress in and the event removed all progress I made. I’ve been in a serious relationship for over a year but since I don’t see him as much as I use to I’ve been feeling insecure and lonely. I miss him terribly. I’m also a freshman in college, although not having anything to do during Christmas break has left me anxious for something to do. I don’t have a job right now, I work at an amusement park and the ride I operate is closed until February. If this helps then cool. Now for the dream. 

**Dream**

The dream is in 3 parts but they’re pretty random to me but I thought I’d include them. 

*Part 1*

I just got my schedule for the new semester and decided to join the swim team. My schedule is pretty consistent however I see the same teacher 3 times in one day, back-to-back, in various rooms and then that same teacher for a Sunday night class (that’s kinda important later). What’s kind of funny is all my teachers are Animal Crossing characters and they’re super cute. Tom Nook is the teacher I see 3 times and once on Sunday. Classes are pretty normal, however my first swim practice is a cluster fuck. I forget everything, my swimsuit, my towel, my goggles— literally everything. For some reason my house is an hour away in this dream and I don’t have a car (I do in real life though). An old girlfriend I had in high school (yes, girlfriend as in relationship) gave me a ride in her red jeep we had when we were dating. Nothing interesting about the trip. Pretty normal, there was just a lot of anxiety about being on time. Somehow, even though the time should not have worked out, I got home, found my equipment, and got back just on time. I changed and then the dream switches

*Part 2*

It suddenly transitions to some sort of secret agent? Video game? kind of dream. I’m bot myself, I’m some sort of buff G.I. Joe looking dude. I’m on a mission to stop some terrorists? from blowing up a train. They’re not like Muslim or anything, they’re like action movie, Matrix like people. A lot of black leather. I repeatedly enter the train and defeat the terrorists. This is what makes me feel like it’s some sort of video game because I see my mission objective and my instructions like a tutorial before I storm the train. Then the last villain comes up and it’s very different than before. Firstly, it’s a woman, it kinda looks like Sandra Oh (which is funny because for Christmas we played a charades like game and one of the people there used Sandra Oh in the game so she was pretty fresh in my mind). She was an impossible foe (as she was in the game, it was very hard to interpret her name) but eventually I managed to capture her. However, even though I had her in handcuffs, she managed to get out of my clutches, do a handstand, and set the bomb (which was a cylinder and to turn on the timer, you twisted it like one of those egg cooking timers). She set it for a few seconds and before I could reach her she blew everything up. 

*Part 3* (the part that’s got me freaked out)

I snap out of a trance and I’m holding a chapstick that looks like a replica of the bomb. For some reason I think it’s the actual bomb and it makes me very nervous. The Sandra Oh terrorist’s picture is on the wall next to me, in handcuffs, looking like a menacing foe. It’s raining really hard outside and it feels like early morning, but my parents are awake and I hear them rustling around outside my bedroom door. I’m aware it’s a Monday. I’m still new to my school schedule so I check the schedule (which like of looks like [a Super Smash Bros Character Card](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTv4jMtdukSdfIXrKfsMvox-Gz32TsfnEIx7-VExvLA2ZbvAxXU) for each teacher) and I notice I missed the class with Tom Nook on Sunday and I get a small panic because I really hate that I forgot I had a Sunday class and missed it. What’s interesting is the picture for his class I missed has him crying, like he got defeated. I resolve to remember and not miss it again. It’s raining outside right now and I hear it hitting the roof, although it’s nothing crazy. Suddenly my bed begins to shake, and I realize EVERYTHING is shaking. I look outside and the trees are shaking. I come to the conclusion it’s an earthquake and it gets stronger (although, it’s not strong enough to cause any damage) and then suddenly it starts causing my bed to flow in waves. I feel myself bend forward and backward with the waves and honestly my house should be falling apart, but it doesn’t. Suddenly, it stops. My mom runs in and asked if I felt that (how could you not?) and we run into her room where she has the news on (I don’t watch it though, but it’s in the background like a radio). My dad is in bed and my brother walks in behind us (which is weird because he doesn’t live with us) and we’re all kind of talking about the earthquake and how crazy it was. We try to look it up on our laptop but for some reason none of us have the ability to type correctly and the words get really messed up (i.e.: “Whagts jvdyust happainged?” “Earthstquake?” “Regikscent Earjxthquakes?”) and instead of Google asking to fix the spelling errors, it just takes us so random tech sites. Suddenly the rain gets VERY hard and there is a large bolt of lightning that strikes close by outside. It’s so close that the laptop kind of drifts towards the lightning. The bolt of lightning doesn’t leave though, it’s sustained and it actually gets stronger. We all watch and I suddenly get really scared. I notice the time and it’s around 9:00 a and suddenly think about school but I’m too scared to go out in this weather. Suddenly what ever the lightning is striking catches on fire but it doesn’t leave. We’re all very scared and start to wonder if it’s the apocalypse. I leave the room real quick and I hear the news start talking about other reports of crazy lighting. I walk into my room and then suddenly I wake up. 

—

The final part of the dream has me terrified. It was very scary experiencing that storm and I’m nervous about it’s meaning. I don’t know if it’s a premonition, or a warning, or what and it kind of makes me nervous. It was like the wrath of God came down. If you find meaning please don’t sugar coat it, just lay it on me straight so I can make appropriate action for myself. Thank you in advance.

I'm a 24 year old man who is about to finish his degree at university. I'm at home for a couple days due to Christmas. I'm an ISFJ. A former apartment I had at university was broken into by a stalker ex in 2015, but this could be irrelevant, as I don't worry about him much anymore and the figure in my dream is not him. I also don't think I have ever had a dream like this before.

My parents keep it unbearably hot in their house at night, so I have to crack the window open avoid being stifled. This is usually not a problem, but tonight I had a dream in which I think I wake up to close the window, and as I turn to move some stuff out of the way, an old, rough, strong hand grabs mine and pulls it out the window. It's dark and I live on the outskirts of town, so I can't make out the face just yet, but there is a silhouette of someone outside the window, yammering incoherently in a low voice.

&#x200B;

Until my eyes adjust I get the uneasy feeling that this is my father. I'm standing at the window with my hand clenched by this person, paralyzed with fear. He's moving my arm around, like he's testing me to see if I'll resist, but I can't. As this happens, I can to see his piercing eyes staring directly into mine and his face painted white with long black bands around the contours of his face, and feathers protruding from his hair, and I start to get the feeling that this being staring at me is actually a demon.

&#x200B;

The only thing he says to me that I can understand is a question, repeated once. ""Are you going to let me in?... Are you going to let me in?""

All I remember is the end, really.  I seemed to have been hanging out with a small group of people in a living room.  All I can remember for sure is that my close ex girlfriend and I were there.  Her current boyfriend may or may not have been there as well on one or more iterations of this dream.  I went to say goodbye to her, she stands up, and kisses me.  In the second version of this dream I remember it got pretty heated for a moment.  Like she started making out with me and did this thing she used to do where she'd press her pelvis into mine while we kissed.  The weirdest part is the vibe in the room suggested that this was normal behavior.  Like, nobody reacted to it, and then I went on my way.  Don't remember anything after that.

I've got several theories on how exactly my subconscious conjured this up and details on shit that's been going on in my life lately that could have led to this dream, but I don't want to make this a super long post.  What I'm most curious about is what anyone thinks the reason could be as to why I dreamt up a group of people who would have treated this as completely normal behavior.

I went into a pet store and got a fish tank and supplies needed to care for fish, and I bought a striped moray eel. For some reason I bought a puffer fish not too long after, and put them in the same tank. I think my dream thoughts were fighting with my reality thoughts because I was like wait, is it okay to put a fish in the same tank as an eel? But shrugged it off. When I came back to the fish tank, the puffer fish had puffed up in defense but the eel still managed to kill it, very violently. It didn't eat it, it just let the body float in the cage and it stayed spiky and sharp.

The eel died soon after from being poisoned by the pufferfish. For some reason I thought someone else was in charge of taking the dead fish out of the tank, so I didn't do anything. So every time I came into the room I saw the corpses of the eel and the pufferfish in the fish tank.

My dreams always are fantastical, as in I'm never dreaming about places I know or have actually been to. It's a strange self contained world that I feel welcomed in, until just a bit ago.

 I was dreaming of being out of town on vacation and getting some Sonic for my SO, and as I was walking back to the hotel I turned the corner and deadass was in the neighborhood I grew up in, and instantly everything felt hyper realistic and just off in a very base way. I had dropped the food on the ground when I saw my parents house and when I looked down at it to pick it up it was as if weeks had gone by in the blink of an eye! I go to my parents house and  to my surprise, they were expecting me back home as I had apparantly just walked out for a smoke. I don't smoke cigs, but I do vape, which when I was living there, my parents let me do indoors with the window open,so that was weird. Also my mom would beat my ass if I smoked cigarettes, grown or not. I look at my phone and it's January 7th, instead of Christmas like it should be. 

I'm flipping at this point, out trying to explain to my parents that I've lost a few weeks of time and I don't know what's going on and they start getting concerned. I look at my phone to text my SO and their number isn't anywhere in my phone or Facebook. My parents are also missing their cats, and my phone had some weird adware that I would never ever let get installed on my phone. I also overheard my mom talking about how the president was ordering the rebuilding of some huge road or monument, and I'm assuming Trump was not president as she was actually agreeing with what he was saying.

 I look through my texts and I had correspondence with musicians to work shows that never happened, and this whole time I just feel like I'm not where I need to be, like I'm breaking some very old and basic rules being where I am. I just wanted to talk to my so but every time I dialed their number it would crash the phone app. I was getting desperate and very scared, so I decided to lay down, and when I fell asleep in the dream I woke up in my real bed, SO sleeping peacefully by me, cat curlled up at my feet. Everything normal.

0.0,a8jlhc,4.0,2.0,"I was in a big wooden building. Many people were standing in line for some sort of attraction.

From one moment to another, I was spot by PewdiePie and other (unknown) Youtubers. I was part of the 'cool kids' gang. They were asking ""Can I go before you in line?"" in which they did. Another member of the pose took some Wiz Khalifa tickets of other people. We could get away with everything. I didn't felt comfortable, but I didn't say anything when we were passing a few people, grabbing free presents. All on all they were all teenage girls (the audience of those Youtubers?). Thankfully we already started almost at the top; where the attraction was.

&#x200B;

Being uncomfortable changed into frustration and anger. Who were those people thinking they were better than others? We are all equal, fuck fame. ""This is not normal, who do you think you are? You can't take advantage of other people, your fans, to get in line faster and get free stuff. You have 'power' over them and therefore be extra careful not to exploit it!"". I felt like starting a revolution. At the top of the building, PewDiePie went crazy! He pushed me on the floor. People were gathering around us, I kept stating my point. He picked up a drill and activated it and pushed it towards my face. His career was over. He let me go, knowing that killing someone with a drill will lead to a long life in  prison.

&#x200B;

On the top of the building there were many young fans. I gave a speech about power and not abusing it. I collected the tickets from a police station and gave them back to the owners. (can type pages about the dream, this was the core).

We were in a house where our dad was telling us this story. It was about a man who feared nothing and fought every one of the monsters that came his way, one day the man comes across these batlike creatures and dies in battle against them. As our dad told the story I was sort of living it from a third person perspective. So the dream fast forwarded to my current age and both me and my sister were getting ready for school, our dad then told us to remember the story (this apparently was a daily thing) and then said bye to us. We walked outside to get to the bus but it’d already gone by, so we went the other way but the bus passed that place too, I then walked to the other street opposite to the front of the house and waited there. Rather than stopping, the bus flew straight past us. We began running after it. As we neared the bus, it started morphing into this treelike creature, with three holes in the front, forming a misshapen face where blue light came out of the holes. I still chased after it for some reason, I’m not sure if my sister was still there with me or not since I was so focused on catching this tree monster. I chased this thing all day, through the streets, neighborhoods, parks, and other places. It was night time when I caught up to it. Once it was in arms length I got out a blade and slashed at it, cutting this thing in half. The insides were like flesh of an animal and it bled this reddish, purple substance. Once I did this I went through a blur of events that I experienced all at once, I saw police, I was running in multiple locations at once, and hiding. Everything became normal again and I was suddenly in a bathroom with my dad telling my sister and I this story again. While he was telling us I hid my hands behind my back because they were covered in the tree monster’s blood.

&#x200B;

I was attacked on Xcraft (A space colonization game) by a swarm of hundreds of thousands of creatures, they destroyed all of my planets completely (impossible in-game). Then I witnessed this from pedestrian level, the world being consumed by virulent swarms of moths that burst out of people and swallow up the landscape. I witnessed these moth creatures become like pixies and find bliss when their duty was done, and then evaporate. 

I’m dumpster diving after crossing a crumbling bridge, with many onlookers. Mostly jovial, well-wishing older folks. I’m in my current town of residence. I make a joke that it looks like I’m escaping from an asylum. They talk about how the land is a certain geological age and therefore that affects the law and property values. 

In the dumpster I see a box, small objects inside. A sewing kit, a pen, that’s all I currently remember.

I wander into an old best friend's yard at night near Christmas with another old friend who used to live there, we are vagabonds, taking from my best friend's water well. This is after crossing a razor wire electric fence, where we are both shocked. Here though we are caught by my best friend and we walk out of the yard, but not before looking inside and seeing our other friends, having a holiday party. They look at us nervously while my old best friend holds us in contempt. I feel horrible as we leave. 

By the ocean at night, a giant lion lays down to rest, another character rests as well, saying something about only having to worry about a pig creeping up on him. In contrast with the lion, this character is small and meek. Then a dark, evil feminine force appears. It is large and spider-like, ghoulish. I wake up.

&#x200B;

Analysis:

&#x200B;

**Apocalypse, isolation, rejection, sadness, regret, some curiosity**. After playing Xcraft and watching a show that introduced a nightmarish scene of moths bursting out of someone’s neck, it’s no wonder this was used as fuel for my nightmares. 

…Apocalypse in this sense began as something frustrating, I was pushed to give up on something that took a while to do, and I still don’t even know what the ultimate reward would look like. Then at street level, the world was eaten from the inside-out by moths. In this sense the moths represented a kind of purge and reincarnation. When the moths were satiated, they became like pixies and vanished. This may point to the fact that once we accept something, bliss can follow. Giving in is sometimes the best thing, especially when it’s an unstoppable force that we have no control over. Not giving up, but giving in, accepting the situation. This part was difficult to understand. 

…Crossing a bridge - entering a new chapter of life, leaving one behind (the bridge was crumbling, signifying that this bridge would soon be impossible to cross). Asylum - it was a joke because it wasn’t true, I’m not actually crazy, nothing’s actually wrong with me and everyone else sees that. The dumpster - humbling myself and being resourceful, harkening back to my time in Australia and college days (I dumpster dived to save money and for fun). Finding the box full of interesting objects, and the pen and sewing kit. This was like opening up to a hidden or discarded part of me that was actually beautiful. The pen signified my strengths, my story, the need to express myself. The sewing kit signified my wish to mend myself and relationships, to put things back together. The old people around me, talking about even older things, discussing property, this had to do with growing up, wisdom, age, and developing a foundation and prosperity. Being welcomed by them means I am developing these traits myself, through wisdom and compassion. 

The scene of the fence and my old friend's home symbolize how both my ""vagabond"" friend and I had difficult barriers to success in our life, we felt like we were stumbling around in the dark. My best friend's family gave us nourishment for a time, but now I fear that old safety net is gone. This symbolized fear of rejection. I felt small, childlike, animalistic, and disgusting. 

The scene of the lion and the ocean - The ocean represents possibility and uncertainty. The lion represents a masculine, fatherly, patriarchal presence.  The smaller, meek character must symbolize a weaker part of myself. Could the meek one be the inner child? The lion was huge and powerful, but exhausted and deep in thought. The meek creature seemed to be satisfied and felt safe, and its only worry was being consumed by gluttonous behavior (assuming this is what the pig stood for). Then this life-force-sucking temptress, insectoid, ghoulish feminine figure emerges from the darkness. What is this, the devouring mother? I haven't really had a presence like that in my life. I think maybe it’s more to do with temptation of desire, maybe even the real nature of the pig. Something’s been unattended to regarding the feminine energy, inside and outside there are dark forces at work, it has to do with gluttony, laziness, ignorance (willful), toxic relationships. Toxic habits. 

&#x200B;

One theory of mine is that the lion, the meek one, and the ghoul are symbolic of the 'king archetype', with the lion representing the king in fullness, the meek one representing the weakling, and the tyrant actually being the ghoul. That would be fitting because I think the weakling/inner-child side has always been at odds with a narcissistic feminine figure in my life, real or internalized. That this part of the triad of the king's shadow has been infected by a dark feminine force should be alarming.",hot,"Moths ate the world, a box opened, ostracism, and the king's triad",1.0

\*\*Note\*\* - This is a repost from /dreams. I posted there this morning but I really want a lot of input on this dream because normally my feelings in my dreams go away shortly after waking, and yet 2.5 hours later I'm still feeling a little anxious/nervous. This dream really felt like it meant something as opposed to my normal dreams that are weird but about mundane or inconsequential themes.

I always have real weird dreams that make little sense and are largely forgotten in the morning.

However if a dream is weird enough I remember it.

Last night I dreamt that me, this girl Ik, and this new guy at work we’re all living at some kind of youth hostel, but in the city we’re actually from. (I’m in america there really are no hostels here) there were a lot of people Ik at the hostel but I was only close with the girl and the new guy, unexplained in the dream.

There seemed to be a lot happening, like world events, outside the hostel.

However, we never went outside even once.

We all hung out a lot, but mostly me and the girl. Eventually it seemed like maybe we had unofficially moved on to something more. Then we had a big fight I don’t remember, and she wouldn’t talk to me.

Eventually an alarm went off and we were all supposed to go to our rooms but I couldn’t find the girl anywhere. When I did I told her about this elevator we could take (we had to go the fourth floor??) and she ignored me and hit the stairs so I hit the stairs too.

We had an argument during g this weird drill/alarm thing and she ran off so I hid my bible (I’m not really religious tho?) and went off to my room. (Idk why the Bible was not in my room it was in some guys room.)

Finally this drill ends and I run off to find my bible and sure enough it’s lightly damaged. The cover is bent and the pages are bent/torn. There’s a huge gash out of the leather cover.

I confronted the girl about it and she said it would be find and my parents would understand and not be mad. I said Ik because I wrecked one before once and replaced it and they never noticed. (?) I told her that’s not what bothered me about it and we started hanging out again.

At one point I went to finish a monopoly game with me her and the new guy from work. The game had been going for days and was said to be intense, and when I walked in the room there was an announcement that we just put two guys on the moon. (Could have been mars?) the new guy is no where to be found, and the girl pops in and out saying her order is here.

So recently I've been having this weird reoccurring dream. For context, I live in an apartment by myself. When I lay on my bed in my room I can look into my hallway. The dream starts with me sitting on my bed doing something (I can't recall what) on my computer. I notice that the light in the hallway is on which isn't too unusual for me. I kind of just know in my dream that my front door is locked since it's always locked and I'm the residence manager at my building so I have the only key in. This part is always the same. As I'm doing whatever on my computer I notice that the clicking of a light switch and the light in the hallway goes off. I look up and just keep staring at my door waiting for whoever is in my apartment to come over. Eventually he does.

The first time it was the inside of an apartment, the second time it was the inside of a larger house and tonight it was the inside of a yacht? the dream with the face and the room itself don’t seem to have any connection? The room simply appeared after the weird face dream. 

Can you help me interpret this? ",hot,Weird dream with a recurring location.,1.0

The first one was that I was jumping into a pond with a crocodile and a duck that was playing a “cat and mouse” game with it but suddenly the crocodile saw me swimming and I ended up frantically trying to swim to shore. I remember seeing how large his teeth were and the terror or what could happen to me was enough to wake me up. Which brings me to my second nightmare in the same night:

This nightmare was that I was in a haunted house that no one else would acknowledge as haunted but the ghosts were taunting me by physically and violently shaking things (like a tv mounted on the wall and a chandelier) as soon as anyone would leave the room. Also, my ex husband was in the house and being sympathetic to me voicing that the House was haunted. There was also a large wolf that ate a small child. This part was particularly disturbing. It seemed like the child was standing up to the wolf when he suddenly chopped down and ran off with a mouth full.  All night I was waking up from both dreams only to fall back asleep and continue experiencing the nightmare. Does anyone have any input? ",hot,2 constant nightmares all night,1.0

I was visiting an unknowm family member withmy dad and he had a house that looked sort of like a dealership. We parked our car where the show cars are usually parked and gout out. Connected to the house was another house and this one looked like the house of a family member from my dads side in cuba but slightly altered. (Btw, these house are in the middle of a shopping center, like an outdoor mall. Also mind you all the mentions of family are on my dads side. I live with both my parents and they are not divorced or thinking of divorcing. Anyways, we're having a good time going back and forth between houses and speaking with all the family. Something happens and sets off a weird chain of events. Me and my father storm out of the house and i start yelling obscenities at the family member, i dont know why but im angry. I keep doing so and security starts coming over. I hear my family memeber make a couple of quips at me through a pa system and i keep yelling. So we head inside to get our car cause they were calling the police. They try getting our plate number and i get out of the car and put a leather jacket from my trunk over the plate so they cant see it. Turns out im already too late cause this tall nerdy dude already wrote it down. I grab the paper and rip it to shreds but he just takes out his phone and writed it that way. I just ignore it and get in my car. I hear the sirens of the police and tell my dad to book it. He seems very nervous and scared, but he books it through the window, hitting a car along the way. We drive recklessly past some people, we hit a couple of cars, gta style. We make it to a school zone but dont slow down. We end up going up a hill, flying off it, and flying over a perfect square mass of students only hitting a couple in the bacl of the block. We ignore it and make our way home. We both are scared shitless and are freaking out. We decide to just sleep it off and ignore it. I go to sleep and wake up thinking it was a dream, but im still in my dream. This is where, to me, it gets freaky lol. I wake up and im starting to see the social reprucusions of my dads actions. My family member is on a smear campaign against my dad and i but hes focusing on me. The students have joined him and they all are suing us for damages. My mom is being supportive and trying to keep both me and my dad afloat with money cause we both lost our jobs. Everything is terrible.

I'm out of ammo, so I turn towards a woman that's at the house with me and ask her for her gun (so I can kill the wounded woman because I'm pissed) but as she's handing me her gun, she takes the magazine out.

I want to know if there is deeper meaning to it and would appreciate as much help as I can get. This is as much detail as I could remember as I was typing it out when I awoke that day:

&#x200B;

So I was in a restaurant/bar and for some reason I was both a patron and a server? Fucking weird. Anyway, an older, dark haired woman comes up to me and asks for something in the menu that doesn't seem to exist. I apologize and tell her that it doesn't seem to be something there. Then she asked for a holographic image mirror pillow (?). Tell her that we also don't carry that. She proceeds to ask for something else and I tell her that none of these things are available. She looks at me and says ""Well then, at your daughters wedding, I'll have 'your father is no longer available' engraved on her wedding ring"" (I don't have any children). So in quick response I say ""service to you isn't fucking available, get the fuck out of the store."" which for some reason makes the whole place erupt in laughter. People are cheering and buying me drinks.

&#x200B;

Cut to me explaining this to the owner. Get my drinks and food for free. So, now I'm on this bus and the bus almost hits this same woman. The bus screeches to a halt to not hit this woman. She is staring into my soul. The whole exchange feels ominous.

&#x200B;

Cuts to bus letting me off at some house. I go inside this house which I do not recognize. There's something wrong here. It's that fucking woman's house. I'm in the living room. It's dark. The only light is one coming from a narrow hallway to my left, so I head toward it. In the middle of the hallway about halfway down is a refrigerator and mostly take up the width of the hallway. I hear noise behind me. I turn around and it's like a shade version of the woman. Screaming at me about me not being available anymore and also about some of the items she had asked for. Her eyes almost appeared to be voids of darkness with almost like wisps of darkness flooding from them (picture dry ice fog, but like black). She raised her arms and screamed a horrifying scream I have never encountered. I somehow was able to make it around the fridge and deeper into her home. I found myself in another dark room with a lazy boy in it. She's still behind me and I feel the darkness and coldness of her aura around me. It's enveloping me. I'm frozen. There's nothing I can do. I am then forced forward onto the lazy boy and hear a final shriek from her. That shriek woke me up.

&#x200B;

The dream above seems to have 3 distinct parts to it as there are several portions that are cut. Again, I do not recognize any of the people or locations within this dream. Can anyone analyze this and come up with what this could all mean? Thank you all for your time!

Edit for my personal info willing to share: I am a 29 year old male who has a friend and his girlfriend as roommates. I dislike his girlfriend as I feel as if she doesn't actually love him and is using him. My parents split when I was 8.

&#x200B;

I'm a 16 y/o male and I've never actually had a nightmare. I've had dreams where I wake up and I acknowledge they're scary (recently, I had a dream a cyclops man made of black slime with horns asked me ""what do you like?"" to which I woke up replying, out loud, ""the taste of candy""; etc dreams of that caliber) but I've never actually felt genuinely frightened by a dream to any degree. Last night, I went to sleep on an empty stomach after taking my medication (100mg lamotrigine and 10mg amitriptyline). I've got bipolar disorder and exercise very frequently, but I've been studying so much I forget to eat. I'm home-schooled and have 100% self-led curriculum which has been causing me a lot of stress to figure out if I'll be ready in time for exams, or that I'm too lazy and am actually not working hard enough.

&#x200B;

My family life is... kind of odd? My parents are divorced. I lived with my mom up until they split when I was 5 and then I lived with my dad for 2 years before going back to live with my mom until I graduate. My sister (who lives out of the house with her fiance) is having a baby in a couple of months and my uncle has been kind of harassing her about it, calling her phone every morning and night until she answers (which she can't! she's a very busy woman). I heard my mom talking about it on the phone a couple hours before I went to bed. My mom's dad has been dead for a year or two, which has been hard on her since it was a traumatic upbringing where her mother was absent and her father was just... unsupportive, generally very mean to her. My relationship with her is somewhat strained because we just don't get along but we love each other very, very much and acknowledge that we have fundamentally incompatible personalities. We're very independent since I had to raise myself alone while growing up as my closest sibling in age is 7 years old than me and between either of my parents, no matter who I was living with, they were never home. I was essentially a latchkey kid.

&#x200B;

Again, sorry for all the context. I truly feel like a lot of it is necessary to understand the dream as there is a LOT of heavy symbolism. My grandmother on my mom's side is also very upset as she feels neglected by the family. My mother has been venting quite often about how her family is currently driving her up the wall, which I definitely think is reasonable. Moving on, my dad and I have a good relationship but at a distance (sadly) and we both acknowledge this. The most recent time I stayed with him was on a trip to Ohio where we stayed at an apartment-like place right on the side of the lake. One night we sat on the porch and had a particularly upsetting conversation that ended in him getting up and leaving me mid-sentence and leaving me on the porch, crying my eyes out until he came back and apologized for walking out on me. I took my best friend with me on the trip, and they are in the dream as well. I don't want to go into detail why (very sorry about that) but I have a very poor relationship with women in general and am very afraid of them. I have nothing against them, really, I just... uh... prefer men? Because women scare me and I can't relate to them at all. I wasn't traumatized by a woman or anything though... I don't think, at least. CHRIST. This is such a long post. I am so sorry. I'm not even halfway done, probably.

&#x200B;

Moving onto the dream (finally!), it kind of started before I fell asleep. IRL, My stepdad went to our old house for the night (we just moved! yuhhh) as we had the kitchen table and my mom's old homemade desk stolen, but not the TVs... it was an odd experience to say the least but I heard him leave around 12:30AM. I went to bed around 01:30AM, which is normal for me. My stomach kept growling because I was so hungry but I really didn't want to get up and get food. I was laying on my back (which I never do) and trying to sleep when I was about half-conscious, thinking/dreaming(?) ""my stepdad is going to get shot and we are going to see it on the news the next morning"" and ""someone is going to break into our house while he's gone, I'm going to have to rescue my mom by beating the attacker with a baseball bat"" which were... very involuntary thoughts. The last thing I remember before truly falling asleep was thinking about talking to my mom about it and saying ""There's nothing I wouldn't do for my mom, I had to do something,"" and somehow I knew it was a news interview even though there was no news crew whatsoever.

&#x200B;

When I \*actually\* fell asleep, I was standing at the ground unit we stayed in at Lake Erie with my dad, but with no furniture. My dad and stepmom had gone out to get groceries, and my best friend was standing behind me. I walked up to the glass door mid-conversation with my best friend and saw that the lake and the sidewalk that was next to it IRL was actually a road I used to cross at my old house, and a particularly busy one. There was a gas station (really, just one gas pump) that wasn't there in real life and there were two women, totally emaciated and upset, looking like they had been hurt. ""These women aren't really hurt,"" I thought to myself, ""but I'll never forgive myself if I don't try to help them."" They looked like zombies - covered in blood, purple-pink skin. I banged on the glass door, yelling ""do you need help?"" and they walked over. The women walked up and one said ""we don't really need help,"" so I said ""ah, you can go then...?"" She smiled and slid a butter-knife up between the doors and let the two in herself. I don't even remember the other woman's face, but the woman with the knife now had a gun.

&#x200B;

I don't remember subduing her at all, but just like before I fell asleep, I was talking to my stepmom, my dad and my best friend interview-style (again, without the news crew, but I knew it was a news interview), saying ""I just didn't want them to shoot me."" I didn't feel like a hero. I was just doing what was expected. ""I couldn't let them shoot me,"" I kept thinking to myself. Wouldn't anyone try to survive?

&#x200B;

It was interrupted by dream #2. I was walking down the stairs of my sister's fiance's house, which I had only been to once at a Christmas party a couple years ago, where my grandmother and mom were standing on the ground floor. I think I had been staying with my grandmother like we usually do when we go up north, but we didn't really say anything about it and there was nothing indicating it. Next to them, there was a door to the underground level that isn't there in real life. I said I wanted to see my grandfather, and my mom said ""Don't! He's being an asshole again,"" but I walked down the stairs anyway. Actually... I don't remember walking down the stairs, I was just down there instantly. Across from me was my grandfather, clear as day, sitting on a loveseat-version of my couch. He said something really hurtful, I don't remember what, and I thought wow, my mom's right, he's being an asshole again. The room he was in had warm, yellow lighting, like there were lamps on both sides of him... sorry if that's odd to say?

&#x200B;

I ""woke up"" in a room down the hall from where I saw my grandfather. Sidebar: I'm incredibly afraid of when I wake up to my mother screaming IRL, since I'm afraid of her coming in to wake me up to have another dispute with me, which happens VERY rarely but I'm still meek about it. Anyways, my door was closed, and despite it being underground, the window behind me had light coming from it.

&#x200B;

Sorry. Another sidebar. Have to line break for it so I don't get too confusing. As I'm typing this, I realize I have been in that room before, the underground one with the light coming through it. When I was around 10, I had a dream where I woke up and there was a creature made of shadows standing by the door, so large it had to bend its back to fit. I wasn't scared. I just saw it and then woke up for real. The setting I am about to describe is from a dream I had where past the couch my mom is sitting on, there are two doorways with no doors: one for women, and one for men, and in the dream I had beforehand I was forced to go into the women's before going into the men's, where I was going to be assaulted (in the dream!). That dream was a long time ago as well - around 4-5 years. However, the hallway connecting these two areas is from the dream with the shadow monster, and the door the locker room is behind is where the bathroom should've been. I hope I am not making this too confusing...? There is a lot going on. edit: I made a diagram, as this was hard for me to word. It's poorly made but. Mspaint and also I suck at making diagrams. The green lines are doors or doorways. [https://imgur.com/a/AX2PvgZ](https://imgur.com/a/AX2PvgZ) Also... the reason I know how the house is supposed to look is because I actually lived there and forgot about it. I've moved a lot.

&#x200B;

So anyway! My mom was yelling on the other side of the door and I heard her stomping down the hall. I got out of bed very quickly. I used to have an issue IRL where if I got out of bed too fast my knees would buckle and I wouldn't be able to walk properly. This happened in my dream, sort of, so I had the feeling it was normal. The difference was: my legs were broken at the knees, completely atrophied past that point. They laid in front of me as I crawled out the doorway, which had been opened neither by my mom or me - it was just open without having to see it opened. I was crawling down the hall, dragging myself with my arms, until I saw my mom on our couch I mentioned earlier, but in full size this time, no loveseat. I knew that on the other side of the wall was where my grandfather was sitting before. My mom was in the dark except for the light from the door, so it wasn't pitch black, but indeed very dim. She was curled up in a ball. She said something like ""you're so disappointing, you're so useless, I bet you're not even using the study material I bought you"" which sounds stupid in retrospect but I tried yelling ""no! I'm not! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!"" but my throat was hoarse and dry, so it came out as a croak. I think I was actually trying to talk in my sleep because as I woke up directly after this my throat felt the exact same.

&#x200B;

I told this dream to my mom when I woke up and while describing it, I said ""I felt like I was in your head, like I wasn't supposed to be there."" I literally felt like I was in... uh. The best comparison I have is in the Persona series when you go into a palace and see someone's cognitive self. It was like her palace but she had a cognitive self, something I had dreamed up (get it?)... sometimes dreams don't exactly make sense and sorry for that being my only way to put it lol.

0.0,a6iylk,3.0,1.0,"I'm a 25 year old guy, INFJ personality type, in a fairly tumultuous time in my life, with an abundance of anxiety and hope for my long term future.

I'm in the last stages of recovery from a 5 year long battle with lyme disease, throughout those years I've had random spikes of intense panic where I am convinced the lyme will kill me. However, on the whole I am much more accepting of the idea of my death and tend to embrace it as another necessary step in my existence. 

I have started my own small business and am nearly at the point of being profitable to the point where I can move out of my family's home, and I have begun to accept my own sexuality (bi) and started down a path of spiritual exploration and deeper connection with both God (in the christian sense) and the universe (in a pagan spiritual sense). All of this is withing the last few months, hence it not being a very stable time for me.

The dream that I had two nights ago is the most significant and yet non nightmarish dream I've had in many years. As most of my remembered dreams are intense fear filled sessions brought on by giving into sugar or wheat cravings right before bed, which I need to avoid while lyme is with me. 

I dreamed of my future home, or what I want to be my future home. A very intricate underground complex comprised of domes (think monolithic dome company in texas) which are connected by tunnels, and the whole structure proceeds in descending levels of domes and tunnels until you get as far down as possible. The surface of the property is covered in a vast flower and vegetable garden, a bee farm, solar panels, and a prop shed/cabin/small structure to keep people from intrusively wandering onto the property as any entrance to the underground home will be concealed, and it needs to be clear the property isn't a park or uninhabited.

The tunnels connecting the dome structures are all transparent and you can look out into a small circular area carved out of the rock that the tunnel occupies. Some of the areas will have mushroom gardens, others will host sculptures or shrines, and some deeper down will hold a very large supply of cheese.

Natural light will be provided to the shallowest underground domes through windows in the ceilings that are placed throughout the property yet obscured by plants, gardens, rocks, etc. The deeper areas will have artificial lighting and the deeper you go, the less time it is assumed one would spend there during the day, and be relegated to activities/purposes accordingly.

At the very bottom of all this (though I don't know how far down nor do I know how a water table has been avoided) is a small tomb. A simple square room carved out of the rock, which is large enough for two caskets, but the only easily visible thing to me as the dreamer is a small alcove in the back wall. The only light comes from candles as the electric lighting stops at the end of whatever stairs lead to this place. In the alcove is my skull. Not the movie image of a skull where the jaw is still attached and all the teeth are flawless and white, but my skull with the various dental work, imperfections, and cracks that I know it to have. It stares outward illuminated by faint candle light, and placed between the upper and lower jaw so that the mouth is partially open is a very large emerald. It is not a raw gem but neither is it cut in such a way to show off lots of facets. The dream ends with my skull with the gem in its mouth staring directly at me, centered as if I am eye level with it. That image remains unchanging for what feels like a very long time, and then is at the forefront of my mind when I wake up. 

I don't know what it could possibly mean, I've never thought long or hard or intricately about what kind of home I want in the future as I figured that was too far off to meaningfully plan for, and while I don't have a huge fear of death in my day to day life it would be also incorrect to say that I want to die or am in any way obsessed with death in general. And my favorite kind of gem is typically reddish or golden in color, I don't even like emeralds as they don't look good on me.

I'm sure there's relevant details that I have forgotten to add, but hopefully I will think of them during discussion.

I am brought into this labratory place that's off the side of this building that I know is not there at all. inside the labratory there is a woman in a labcoat. she talks about motherhood and how it's so great. then we are given ""baby"" babushka dolls to look after. I take one, and keep it with me. I walk down a hill and near a playground. I drop my babushka doll onto a hard surface and it cracks. I press my hand in the crack and the doll bleeds from it's wound.

0.0,a6cf42,7.0,2.0,"Okay, so a brief background before I get into the meat of my question here. I grew up in a Lutheran household, and was started out with a christian faith, but I recently(within the last couple years) experienced what some would call a “fall from grace” or a “loss of faith”, and now find it difficult believing in any one religion.

I am, however, a very firm believer in the para- and supernaturals. Which brings me closer to my real question, but not precisely there yet, cause there is yet another bit of story to go through first.

I very recently returned from a trip to Florida with family, and since then, have had these very peculiar, very lucid dreams, where I am back at the airport in Orlando, and as I’m heading toward the security screening checkpoints to leave, there is this very prominent figure with an overwhelming aura of positivity and, for lack of a better word, right, radiating from them, telling me that I need to not leave, to stay in Orlando, and that my calling was there. And every time, as the dream progresses, as I board the plane and get closer to my home, back to where I’m from, this consuming feeling of depression and sadness grows stronger and stronger, until I wake up.

So now my, that brings us to my real question, which is, is there real meaning to dreams like this? The reason I’m so interested was because I recently put my info on one of those “we’ll sell your info to schools based on what you answer on these ‘course quizzes’” websites, and Full Sail University contacted me the next day and got me all the way through the application process. I’m currently just waiting for my FAFSA stuff.

&#x200B;

In my dream my adult daughter has a deer in her room. She calls me in to see it and informs us she must put it down because it is old. No one ever questions, we all just know it has to happen. I don't want anything to do with it so I leave. My daughter comes out 10 minutes later saying it isn't working she needs help and when I go in the room I see a deer with half its head off, and so I freak out and quickly grab a rifle and go in and put the deer out of its misery. But all the while this isn't a stressful thing, its like we all knew that was going to happen and I just act. When the deer is gone, its spirit is definitely in the room but no longer in the body. It is now after realizing that the deer's spirit is free, I notice my wife is on the floor and tells me she now needs to show me something very personal but that she needs me to understand because she feels as if I can not comprehend it.

She takes a rock, quite like a quartz geode, and put it in the middle of a circle. She tells me that this is the universe and it the thing closest to her heart. She then takes a small emerald and puts it on top of the geode and tells me that is her heart and the closer an object is to her heart the more important and precious it is for her. She then takes 6 rocks and surround the geode and tells me that those rocks are our kids and grandkids. Two larger rocks get put outside those, one on opposite sides of the circle, which she tells me are her parents. Each of those rocks representing the kids and her parents are quite the same type just differently shaped. Then she grabs a handful of small rocks and almost makes a small circle, rock mote for lack of a better description, around the outside and says those are her closest friends. There is probably 100 pebbles but she says because the are scattered all over the world multiple pebbles represent the same person. She then takes on large black rock and puts it outside everything near the deer and tells me that it represents me as her husband. In the dream I get upset and ask why I am so far away from her heart, and she tells me that the universe may surround her heart but I am there to protect anyone or anything else from entering her circle. As her husband my first job is to protect her heart not be near it. Each night this is the point I get so upset and get up to leave and when I do I look down and her design has become to the shape of Africa. She tells me that is just the design of her soul and I look up and the geode is now two triangles working together like a rubix cube. She tells me thank you for protecting my heart but to get out and protect anyone from getting near her heart, at all cost. I always wake up at that part.

____
My family was living at our old house (which we lost to foreclosure 8 years ago) again and my brother, sister, and I were hanging out at home. My sister was super stressed from finals (which she is going through now) so she was baking - A LOT. I distinctly remember seeing chocolate topped fudge bars, cookies, and brownies. 

Something in the house had broken, so we called dad and he came over on his way home from work. I was confused because it was morning... he said he'd taken a short day. I was the only one really talking to him, he ate a couple of my sister's treats and then I walked with him outside. There were two ride-on lawn mowers sitting on the lawn. I assumed in the dream that's what we had needed his help for - ours must have broken so he brought his. 

I was saying thank you and we were looking at the mowers from our front porch when AN ENORMOUS SNAKE (like, the size of the mowers and kind of cartoony) came from the far left of our yard, past the mowers, and toward the neighbor's house. It was FAST. Dad and I ran after and stopped at the end of the driveway and saw it get up to the neighbor's door where there was a dog door. A little dog hopped out of the house because of the commotion and in my mind's eye I saw what was about to happen to the dog (it wasn't pretty) so I called the dog which zipped over to me right past the snake super fast and it hopped into my arms and my dad and I ran as fast as I could to our house and threw the door closed and told my sibs to lock down all windows and doors (including the cat door to the garage). 

Then my cat woke me up.

I'll list the dreams one by one (there is only one per night that I can remember). I am F, in my late 20s, slightly introvert (but have many friends) and high achiever. 

**First night:** I am behind the front passenger seat in a red pickup truck going very fast on a straight long bridge. Water is bright blue and clear. I am not wearing a seat belt and the window is open, so when the driver (who I had faith in) drove straight through the railing and plummetted into the sea I was the only one able to swim out when the car started sinking. Everyone had closed windows or were strapped in. I swim to the bridge where some pedestrians refuse to believe that there had been an accident though I am thinking the car must be visible because of the colour of the car and clarity of the water. How come no one saw the accident? I beg them for help, for an ambulance and the police. They eventually relent but the hospital refuses to see me because they say I am lying. I call my mum who tells me she is fed up hearing of accidents, even if I am in one it doesn't mean anything. I scream at everyone to find my friends. Wake up with my heart beating.

**Second night:** A friend of mine moves in next door and wants to take a walk in the rain. I tell him to be careful because there is thunder, but he doesn't listen. The next time I see him he is keeping silent, eventually I realise he wants to tell me something but can't. I infer that his mouth/throat was struck by lightning, his stomach damaged badly but throat melted shut. He tries to vomit blood but can't, so his neck explodes with bloody vomit. I wake up.

**Third night**: standard school/exam dream. I appear at my school and there's a test I have not studied for. I wake up in a panic, sweating and with my heart beating. 

**Fourth night/last night** I dream that my dad is alive again (he had a traumatic death about 10 years ago). He tells me it was a mistake and that he is alive. I wake up hopeful and my heart breaks when I have to learn the fact all over again. I am including this as a nightmare because of the grief this causes me - it is a recurring nightmare that he comes back to life, dies again etc. After night three of nightmares I thought ""oh well, at least I didn't have the resurrection dream"" - which of course, I immediately did.

0.0,a5whuq,0.0,1.0,"I find myself sitting front row at the premiere for a short film.  Setting is outside; picture like a fancy outdoor wedding, but with a projector screen up front. There are some celebrities there: Reggie Watts is the host, Nick Cannon is in attendance, and Michael Cera is next to me wearing a yamaka and talit (Jewish prayer shawl). Some of my friends are there as well, including Lauren, who is just a random acquaintance from high school. Despite the many celebrities present, all of the cameras and reporters are focused on her; perhaps she is the guest of honor? Eventually, we all take our seats and look to the screen. There is a sense of anticipation and vast importance as the movie begins.

Opening shot: Kitchen of a single family home. Repairman is on a ladder fixing something on the ceiling. Baby/toddler runs through the scene (he looks and is confused for a second, then goes back to work); baby is wearing a costume of an exotic bird i.e. green tights with long green feathers coming out of the back. A few seconds after he runs through the shot, the two parents slowly walk through, dressed in full army camo, holding guns, being very careful and stealthy like they are on the hunt. Reminds me of the scene in Forrest Gump when they are trudging through Vietnam.

Cut to a staircase (the staircase in the house). At this point the film is in first person view. In a way, I am watching the film through the eyes of the character but I am also experiencing the feelings of the character directly; i.e. it is happening to me. The mother of the child is no longer there, it is just me. I don’t know if I am now playing the character of the child's father, or if it's just myself, but either way I am continuing to “hunt.” 

As I walk up the staircase, the world morphs (picture the wardrobe in Narnia)... and now I’m walking through a forest will all sorts of different colored exotic birds in the trees. I notice the variety of birds and then realize that whatever bird/baby/thing I’m looking for must be very rare and important. 

I reach the base of a trail that leads up a steep hill covered in sand. In other words, it starts off as a wooded trail and turns into a sand dune.  As I am climbing this hill, I somehow receive a message, either by telepathy or some kind of radio transmission. They say that the special bird/baby I'm looking for is *very* elusive, and only can be seen in the wild when the *humidity* *is* *high*. This is immediately followed by another message: a weather report.

 “Clear skies today, a hot day, with a humidity of 79%.” 

Suddenly I get a sudden rush of anxiety and excitement because I realize that the conditions are met for me to finally meet this “thing.”

Once I reach the summit of the hill, a vulture swoops in from behind. Startled, I get down to the ground and watch as it barely misses me. A second vulture zooms past (towards me from this angle, and just above my body), followed a few more. All of a sudden there is an intense, loud siren accompanied by another message/transmission: **“LEAVE NOW.** **GO** **DOWN** **THE** **HILL** **AND** **GET** **TO** **THE** **SHORE.”** I get up to a standing position and start to run down back down, although it's more like a stumble because of the steepness of the sand dune.

Right at the base of the hill is the shore which leads directly into the sea. Having so much momentum going down, I end up running straight into the water, and once I get there I lose my balance and fall on my back. 

Laying face-up in the shallow water, I become very light-headed and disoriented. I can no longer move my body, and this leads me to the realization that I will probably drown here or die some other way. So I decide to “let go”... and suddenly my body is seen from above, with the camera slowly zooming outward, watching my lifeless body float in the water. Once it zooms out enough to see the entire beach, a herd of bison are seen running along the coast. This is a very expansive and cinematic last shot as it fades to black.

The film ends and I am now sitting in a room (indoors, not the original premiere) with a few miscellaneous friends/acquaintances. We try to discuss the ending, agreeing that they wanted to leave it up to our interpretation rather than letting the baby/bird finally be caught and revealed.

Last night I dreamt that my cousin gave me a magic red coin for my birthday, it was transparent and had no markings. She told me if I held it and wished for something it would happen. While this was going on there was the sense I was running from someone. At this point she left, and what ever was after me was coming. I never saw it but other people around were running, idk I just knew I had to run also. So I wished to be somewhere else. The coin started glowing and there was some symbol in the middle that also began glowing. Then I was somewhere else. After I realized the coin actually worked I stared wishing for things, but I also kept continuously losing the coin. I always eventually found it though, after a little panicking. At this point I found myself lost in some kind of dream world within my dream. I don’t remember a lot about this place but I was told by someone/thing that I only had so much time to get out of this dream world or I would be stuck there forever. This all still felt like a dream though, I wasn’t lucid to my knowledge. I somehow got out of that reality, (though I don’t remember how) and back to my original dream. This whole next part is really weird to me. I find myself in something I can only describe as a hair salon, restaurant combo. I was sitting at a table with what I think was my parents, when I heard a lady next to me say, she wished that she was saved. So I pulled out the red coin, closed my eyes and wished that she was saved. When I opened my eyes she was a totally different woman.

For a few years, I've had a lot of dreams involving bathrooms/toilets. The dreams are usually pretty similar in structure but there are two major reoccurring bathroom dreams I have; ones where I'm in a very open-space public bathroom, and ones where I'm trying to use my own bathroom at home.

In the former, I'm usually in some kind of public place, like my high school or a fairground, and I go to use the bathroom but it's not the standard stalls-and-sinks. It's a large open space, like a grand hall where the room is massive and the ceilings are super high. Sometimes it's a ""locker room"" with free-standing lockers and only curtains separating the men's/women's lockers, but it's always wide open with toilets sitting evenly spaced across the room. Kind of like [this](https://i.imgur.com/wgWZoLC.jpg), but with waaaaay more toilets. Somewhere around 40-50 or so.

As soon as I find one to sit on, other girls flock in and I just can't pee. It feels inappropriate, like peeing on a busy sidewalk. Some of them are just passing through, but a few actually do use the bathroom, and they don't seem to notice or care there's zero privacy. They're super pro and chill about the whole affair, and I'm just too uncomfortable to ever actually pee.

In the latter dreams where I'm at home, I'm usually in a strange version of my current house. My family moved from my childhood home to a new house about five years ago, so when I dream about being home, I usually dream of my childhood home, but these dreams exclusively take place in a dream-like version of my current home. The architecture is never right, but it's a dream, so that's a given, right?

When I'm looking for my bathroom at home in my dreams, it's not always because I have to go. Sometimes I want to touch myself, or I'm just looking for some privacy. To get to the ""most private bathroom"" in the house, however, I have to go into the laundry room, out into a screened-in porch (that we don't actually have,) into my parents' room, then the bathroom door is in there. It's like a chunky hallway curled up like a chameleon tail, rooms just lined together in a weird, convoluted way. Trying to get to that bathroom, I always get stopped in the porch, and my dream neighbor always glares at me or shouts at me. If I try and crawl below the screen/fence level, he just shouts that he can see me. It's super embarrassing and it feels like he knows I'm going to do something immoral as soon as I get to the bathroom, even though he doesn't and it's none of his business anyway.

By the time I get to the bathroom, I lock myself in and it *is* super private; no windows, soundproof walls, nobody in the house at all, just me and a bathroom, but I feel so guilty and I *know* the neighbor is out there. It's like I'm trapped and I can't even do whatever I was going to do, or enjoy myself at all because I know I'm guilty and it feels like he knows what I'm going to do.

So the **TL;DR** is; Some dreams, I'm in a wide-open bathroom with no privacy and it's impossible to actually go. Other dreams, I'm trying to use a super-private bathroom in my own home but the way there is super-NOT-private and my neighbor is always spying on me and judging me.

0.0,a5ddga,1.0,5.0,"This happened today at work... I work in an office of a bank. My office sits across from the teller line so when customers turn around they can see me at my desk. 

I was sitting at my desk talking to another employee that had just been walking by when I noticed this blond girl and assumingly her boyfriend standing at the teller nearest me's window. It's slow time if the day, so no other customers are in the building.  The guy is conducting his transaction cashing a check or whatever, but the girl just keeps staring at me. I'm a pretty outgoing friendly person, especially at work, so I just smile and say hello to her. 

She took that as an invitation to walk across the lobby and step into my office.  She looks a little rough, she's wearing an oversized sweatshirt, probably belonging to the BF, hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, seems to be around my age  (mid thirties) and looks like she might have been pretty when she was younger, but that a hard life had caught up to her. She called me by my maiden name as she walked in, but it was more like a question. I said yeah, and am still smiling at her. She continues to walk around my desk right up beside me. At this point I start to feel slightly uncomfortable, but I think I still have my now fake smile plastered on my face unsure of who she is, how she knows me, or what she wants. 

She then stops about 3 feet from me and says ""This is going to sound really crazy, but I've had like 7 reoccurring dreams about you.""  You can imagine my shock at this statement,  and I'm sure my face conveyed it to her.  

I'm not sure what I said at this point, probably uncomfortable laughter, but she continues on to say that in every dream I'm in a car accident and she is attempting to free me because I'm pinned inside the car. She says I'm talking to her as she is trying to cut me free from my seat belt.  She doesn't know where we are when it happens.

By this time I'm having an extreme wtf moment and I want to know who she is. She tells me her name and I feel like I vaguely remember her from high school, but I don't think we've ever met or had a conversation. She says she saw me earlier this summer at my kid's baseball game and the first dream happened right before that. 

Before she leaves she tells me ""I know we're not friends or anything, so I'm not sure why I keep having this dream. I just hope that now that I've gotten off my chest and told you that I can stop having it""

This is legit the weirdest thing that anyone has ever said to me.  I have no idea what the meaning of it could be, but it has me a little creeped out.  I'd love to hear some opinions from others as to what you think about it.

&#x200B;

**The dream**  
I'm on holiday in a villa. I'm sat on a sofa, and there is a boy (not known in my life) a few years younger sat exactly to my right. There's a girl (not known in my life) on the floor in front of the TV we're facing setting up a casting device. My dad is sat to the right of me, and my mum on the left, both in armchairs - both kind of between myself and the girl - as if the five of us made up an elliptical shape. Bar the girl setting up the TV, we're all having light-hearted conversation. We're giggling and sharing anecdotes with each other. Once the casting device is up and running, we all start sharing photos and videos on the TV.

I had been talking about a memory of this boy taking part in a race and tried casting a video recording of it. I asked the girl what the PIN was to cast as she was blocking that part of the TV, and she moved and pointed to it. Simultaneously, the boy to my right exclaims that she can't talk. While watching it, and out of my parents' view, the boy cosies up to me, and gives me a little kiss on the cheek before resting his head on my shoulders. I go to cast something else after the video has finished, and encounter technical difficulty - it won't work.

The girl says, ""Here, pass me it, I'll try"". But she has no luck. She passes the phone to my dad who has a look at it for me. Meanwhile, someone else casts something. Once that video is done, I pick up the phone which is now on the floor near my dad. It's as if it's been reset back to factory settings. There's no photos, videos, or messages. When I say, ""it's all gone"", my mum says awkwardly, ""yeah, he tried to fix it, but it turned itself off. When it came back on, it was wiped"".

Fast forward a few days and just my family (including my sister) are around the swimming pool. I start as if to say, ""I'm going to go and meet \[this boy\]"", but I don't get to say it...

*...and wake up.*

&#x200B;

**Emotions felt**  
Contentment - while sitting, relaxing, and chatting  
Love (first) - companionship; I feel like it was the first time this 'individual' and I had done this  
Frustration - being told the girl couldn't talk, and then very soon after, talking.  
Frustration - having my phone wiped  
Loss - not getting to say where I was going.

&#x200B;

**Background**  
I get on fine with my family. They love me, and I love them. Thirteen years ago, I came out as gay to my dad, and didn't have a great experience with it. So much so, I came out to my mum via a letter I wrote to her three years later. Recently, I've been regretting that I didn't tell her how I always planned to, and have been trying to tell her I'm sorry for that, but haven't been able to. The moment 13 years ago wasn't great, but we've made steps without ever acknowledging it, and I'm good with everyone in my family. I'm quite happy with family life at the moment. But I have been single forever, and that is something I've really wanted to change.

&#x200B;

**Interpretation, or what I've taken from it**  
I was friends with the boy in this dream. I accepted his close company, therefore I must have been accepting of his love. All engagements happen out of the view of my parents. It occurs to me that the girl who can't talk is actually me. She can talk, but there are times when not talking is just easier. Just passing that subject by is easier. My dad accidentally (or on purpose) wiping my phone props up as a reminder of our conversation 13 years ago, as if the phone is memories of me and this boy, and he doesn't want them there. My mum's awkwardness comes from knowing-but-not-knowing. She was on the other side of the room after all - how does she even know what my dad has done? And ultimately, I lost \[my love\] because it didn't happen like it was ""supposed to"".",hot,"I didn't believe in dream interpretation, until now.",5.0

I had a dream a few nights ago where I was back in high school (common theme in my dreams, normally in my dreams aggravating things happen there)

I was in the class and my teacher was a half woman half witch, but didn't give off any unusual vibe. She brought the class to a supply closet and told us one of us needs to go into there in the dark to find ammunition for a pistol, to hunt witches. Nobody speaks up, so she says someone has to, and I eventually accept. Suddenly it's her bedroom, but I don't find ammo. I didn't feel any fear or dread, just intrigue on why she wanted me looking through her things

Next thing I know, I'm in class. I decide to look at my genials, and notice Norse runes tattooed on my member, with an Odin rune being the most prominent, and quite a few needles in my testicles, going from one side to the other. At this point I'm a little annoyed, I knew it was her, somehow. I pull two out, but decide to stop because I didn't want fluids leaking out. I make a run for it, and barely get out through the door. After I get out, I feel a sense of Justice, like I did the right thing, and use my superpowers to wall jump and superspeed my way out.

I usually dream of crazy scenarios, and in my dreams I almost always have control, or at least feel like I have control of my actions, so I'm assuming it's somewhat lucid, although not completely.

I ask myself if I’m really awake, and move around and knock on the walls and decide that I definitely am awake, because everything worked as it should. I leave my room and see that the light over the stove, the one i keep on all night, is still on and decide that that means that one light is on a different grid than the rest of the lights in my building (?).


I open my front door and the entire neighborhood’s lights are out - very spooky, I’d never seen it like that.

Anyways. I remember a dream I had when I was about 5. I am now 33. To this day I can describe in detail about what happened in this dream and it's stayed with me all these years and i would love to hear people's interpretations/theories etc.

So in my dream I wake up in my childhood bedroom. I am playing on the floor underneath my window. All of a sudden, a massive ray of blinding sunshine comes through the window and a silver locket falls from this ray of light onto the floor. I pick it up and in my dream feel overwhelmed at this 'gift'.
I am so excited about this gift that I have to show it to my mother who is downstairs in the kitchen (where she spent the majority of my childhood). As im running down the stairs, it becomes very vivid at this point, there is a bad atmosphere all of a sudden and the house starts shaking around me and I feel scared. I make it to the kitchen after time seemed to stand still on the stairs and my mother isn't there. Instead, I lay down on the kitchen floor facing the window, almost like I'm praying on my knees, and the ray of light comes back again. I hold out the locket and I say 'god, you can have it back'.

I was running down a spiral staircase that was square in shape. Someone was by my side, but I never looked over to see who it was nor did I know what we were running from. We came to a chasm at the bottom of the staircase. There was no where to go. I knew this was meant to be the end of whatever was going on but somehow without hesitation I quickly ripped what appeared to be some kind of plastic lining off the wall that worked as a rope to hoist myself to the bottom of the chasm. At the bottom was a strange place, tropical in climate with lots of ferns and not many trees. Soon after I reached the bottom I realized the person that was running down the stairs with me was someone I loved(romantically). I didn't know who they were, but the feeling was indistinguishable. It was very odd. At the same time, the inhabitants of the chasm were asking me ""Why would you do that?"" I knew they were referring to me ripping the lining off and entering the chasm, as when I did it I got a feeling as though I was cheating the system. I don't know what was meant to happen but I got the feeling that it not happening and me ripping off the lining and entering the chasm seriously messed up something for the inhabitants. It caused something along the lines of a glitch in the matrix for lack of better terminology.

I curse the fact that I did not lock the door to prevent this uninvited person from entering, I feel that its my fault he is here. While he does not seem immediately threatning he is a strange man and I can't get rid of him. He is interested in me sexually but is not overtly agressive. Im trying to get rid of him without making him mad for fear he will turn mean, also for fear of seeming rude despite knowing that I have every right to be rude to a strange man walking into my home and acting entitled to my attention. I allude that my mom and dad will both be home soon and it will be awkward to find him there with me. They both come home seperately but don't think its strange at all and do nothing to help me get rid of him despite my discomfort (which they seem to not notice).

I keep shaking. This same kind of format repeats one more time, but i dont remember where or many of the details, but i remember it happened twice.

this one actually happened yesterday and it really freaked me out.

I see a guy with a messy beard and a white hat. I ask him what hes doing and i dont remember what his response was.

Each door is unlocked, go inside to find many of the rooms are already furnished, new beds, fresh sheets. Find a small room, resembles a storeroom. Inside I see a hospital trolley, the ones doctors and nurse use while doing their rounds, stocked with first aid supplies... and pens. Dozens of new pens. I take two pens after some deciding (burgundy and black), and make my way back outside. At least twenty cars are driving slowly in procession, some with trailers. Someone steps out of a moving car, recognises me and runs towards me, giving me a hug. It was person I went to high school with. We talk about “everyone moving in” and “how does the place look”. Dream ends Hollywood tv show style (including dramatic music): me looking at the building with curiosity, wondering what would could happen next.

>Abstract  
>  
>BACKGROUND:  
>  
>The meaning of unconscious dreaming has been assigned varying degrees of historical significance throughout the ages and across different cultures including in major psychological theories of psychopathology. While dreams' meaning and implications have remained controversial, not disputed is the occurrence of drinking/drug-using dreams (DDUD) when people enter recovery from a significant alcohol and other drug (AOD) problem. Typically taking the form of a relapse scenario followed by relief on awakening, such dreams can be profoundly unnerving. Beyond common anecdotal reports of these phenomena, however, very little is known about the prevalence, predictors, and decay of such dreams with time in recovery. Greater knowledge could help inform patients and providers about what to anticipate in recovery. . . .

>DDUD appear to occur among a substantial minority of US adults resolving significant AOD problems and are related to a more pronounced and deleterious AOD history. DDUD attenuate in frequency over time in recovery which plausibly may be indicative of increased biopsychosocial stability that reduces neurocognitive reverberation and psychological angst regarding relapse risk. Further prospective research is needed to understand the frequency, topography, content variability, and influence such dreams may have on intermediate (e.g., abstinence self-efficacy) and ultimate (substance use) outcomes.

I would class these as anxiety dreams but specific to someone in early recovery.  Frequency of the dreams diminish over time in recovery . . . the same way high school dreams diminish over time after last stepping foot in a high school, for instance.",hot,Drug Dreams & Drinking Dreams,1.0

I remember feeling tremendous guilt I never bothered to try and make something serious with her that would have saved her from this fate. The regret was so powerful I still feel this crushing pain in my chest, I never even gave it a second thought at the time I knew her. 
Ultimately the detective and I never find out what happened exactly. But what we do find out is so ridiculous out of Hollywood crazy, so bear with me. I was a ghost, the investigator was my descendant and the girl was very old before she was murdered.
It's at this point that I realized I MUST be dreaming, however my brain tricked me into thinking that I, THROUGH MY DREAM, am projecting a ghost to the future to attend her funeral, because at the time of her death, I had been long dead. 

This is one bleak dream about deep seated regret over a girl that got away, I can see that much. However, this is the first time ever that I had fucking PLOT TWISTS in my dream. It felt so powerfully vivid, that I just HAD to call her and see how she's doing. She's doing just fine of course. 

PS: My post history is just electronics stuff, so don't bother. 
I'm wondering if people can see something about this that I already don't, I've had a lot of random flicks in University, I obviously regret not trying with her, but she's a good friend, I wanted to keep it that way.

0.0,a464l9,0.0,2.0,"about a few days ago i had a dream where i went inside my house (not actually my house, just a random house that i thought was mine in the dream)after going somewhere and so i went to try to go inside only to realize the door is unlocked. i had an uneasy feeling but like an idiot, i went inside anyways and i went to to my 2nd living room and i started hearing noises from deep within my house, so then i stood there paralyzed for a bit and i could feel the panic bubble inside me, so i started to head for the door. Thats when i heard a loud noise behind me and some woman i dont know was chasing me. I don't really know this person irl or in the dream, but as i run the more i get sort of lost in my own damn in dream house and i'm trying to find a way out. at some point i realize that panicking the way i was, was not going to cut it so i forced my mind to find some rationality and i opened a door. This is when the woman caught up to me and was about to stab me when some other chick who i immediately recognized as my best friend(in dream, not irl i dont even know this person.)comes in ad stabs the woman and kills her right in front of me. She then stands up and stabs me twice on my arm and leg, so i booked it and started running (the best i could) deeper and deeper inside this house that im honestly surprised was this big. My friend was taunting me the whole time and  at some point i was able to get my rationality back in check and i opened a door and went through it and the whole place turned and morphed into some kind of toy store or dollar store. I could see the exit in front of this store and i went for it, but my leg gave out and i fell and hit my head and now my head was bleeding along with my arm and leg. I knew that there was no way i could use it so i started crawling for dear life knowing that my best friend was somewhere behind me with an insane face and a bloody knife trying to kill me. The exit from the store was made of glass and the walls next to it were made of glass. Of course, the door was locked and i didnt have enough strength to break anything. i could see my friends outside of the glass and they could see me, and i started screaming and pleading for them to help me, but they wouldnt at first. they just stared at me and wondered what was wrong but were unfazed by my state or how i look. my friend had now found me and was walking towards me from the back of the store. thats when my friends outside decided to help me and i was able to get out. no one ever questioned why i was the way i was or worried. everything carried on as normal and my friend continued to pretend to be my friend even after what had happened. The reason this dream stuck with me was because of the sheer terror and horrible panic and helplessness i felt. especially when i reached out to my friends, and they wouldn't help me at first. i woke up and i was creeped out of my mind and felt paranoid and i was having a hard time that it wall all a dream and that this is actually reality. what do you think?

I was alone in my house and someone walked in. It was a really pretty, fat chick. (Notice the comma) I ran to the hallway, cause she entered through the living room.
""Leave! I have a gun!""
She still started walking towards me so I ran into my parents room where there was 2 guns in my dad's cover. It was dark and the only light was coming from the hallway. She walked to the door way.
""LEAVE I HAVE A GUN!""
I yelled and she still stood there smiling. I took it off safety and fired.  Or attempted to. It made a click several times and I threw it back into the cover and grabbed another one. I took it off safety, aimed  and it was a bit harder to pull the trigger, but it shot. The bullet hit her in the shoulder just like I had intended. She ran to the front of my hallway and then collapsed in pain. I put the gun back and ran over to her. She was bleeding really bad and I told her I had to check if the bullet went through or was still in there.
So I unbuttoned her shirt and the bullet was still in there.  It was peaking out at the top of the wound
`~Gory Details~'
I squeezed the skin around the bullet wound so the bullet would stick out a bit more. I dug around a bit more and got the bullet out. The bullet and blood disappeared from my fingers.

Once I got the bullet out I used something to stop the bleeding (don't ask it's dream magic.) We got to know each other better and I found out she was a Cosplayer. I was like
""I'd show you my wigs but my room is a mess!""
""Oh! I can clean it for you! In gratitude for saving my life.""
I was going to let her do her thing but I had to show her how to leave for when my parents got home. So I showed her the back door.

In the dream last night, I was walking outside a cabin that was my house in the dream. As I came around the front porch, I found an odd scene. There were two large mushrooms growing in a neglected garden where a pet was buried, and a few feet away, there were two snakes. One was very thin and black, and the other was dusty brown. 

The black snake noticed me, but the brown snake didn't even seem to register my presence. When I got closer, the black snake struck out and bit my finger, too small to do any real damage. I caught the black snake, and decided to ask other people if they knew what kind of snake it was, so I headed off to a building where there were other people. On the way there, I realized that it wasn't a snake, but a caecilian. As I came to this realization, I reached the building and opened my hand to look at the caecilian, only to discover that it had fallen all to pieces in my hands. 

When I returned to the neglected garden, the brown snake that had ignored me was gone. I harvested one of the two mushrooms before deciding that I wasn't comfortable eating mushrooms that grew on a pet's grave.

At this point, my mother came out of the house and I told her about the snakes. I told her that there were many snakes around, and I decided to look for more. I saw a brown snake's tail under a bush, and when I approached, the snake turned around and revealed itself to be a gaboon viper settled in the leaf litter. I went to go get better equipment to catch the dangerous snake, but when I came back, my mother had it in her hands. When I panicked, she told me that it wasn't real and told me to look in its mouth. When I did, I realized that the snake wasn't real. It was a puppet.  


While I like snakes just fine, I don't have any real attachment to them. My life is kind of a mess right now (my marriage ended in October, I'm applying for a new job, I still haven't found a new place to live, I just bought a new car), so odd dreams aren't unexpected, but this one felt both symbolic and important.

My best friend kisses me, it seems impulsive and not at all what he intented to do. He panics and starts apologizing furiously. I stopped him and said, ""Why did you assume I would be upset?"" He responded with ""Oh thank god."" And kissed me again. We start making out and I realize that this is a dream. I force myself to wake up but realize that I can't move. 

I can hear people talking but my eyes won't open. A woman with a soft but firm voice says I need more rest. A man who sounds desperate and afraid argues that this kind of sleep is dangerous. I can't help but drift off again I wake up in the theater and can't find my friend, I want to find him. Suddenly the screen cuts to black. I knew something was playing on it previously but never noticed what it was. It cuts on again as a mirror and the flights come up. The theater is empty. I hear a loud unfamiliar man's voice, like he is on a paper system, say let it bite you. I look around but see nothing.

Then I look at the giant mirror and there is a giant two headed snake next to me. One head bites me immediately, I think it was painful, but I was too scared to notice. I start hitting it, trying to scratch it, something as it wrapped itself around me. Then the other head bites the one biting me. I fight for a bit  and manage to get lose as the two heads fight each other and I run. 

I wake up again and still can't move or open my eyes. The despreate sounding man is trying to wake me. The woman is trying to stop him and calling for people to help her.

I was standing on a orange dirt road in an orchard during the evening, facing a green hedge, which was a foot or so above my height. 

To the left of me, one of my exes stood in the indention of the hedge (only a foot or so); to the right of me, another of my exes stood in the indention of the hedge (also approximating a foot). One of my exes would face me (usually the left on first), and I faced them while the other remained silent but observed our interaction. My ex would usually perform some affectionate gesture: embracing, cooking, some loving words I can't recall now, but I would remain fairly silent, accepting it as if I had no control. 

The gesture over, I returned facing the green hedge in front of me and was approached by my ex on the right, who also performed an affectionate gesture but with motive to incite jealousy based on what she'd seen. She did not mention what she saw, but her aggressive demeanor and eye over shoulder suggested her motive to incite jealousy. Once again, I accepted the affectionate gesture passively, feeling as if I had no control in accepting or declining, but I was not stressed by my inability to react.

Change of pace:

Second or third gesture in, one of the exes would tire of the jealousy, speak her mind and leave the both of us. I'd try to console her in earnest, saying I didn't mean to upset or hurt her. She'd leave her indention in the hedge and I walked after her, trying to resolve the hurt she experienced. This was the only time I actively reacted with my exes.

These alternating acts of affections occurred with eight of my exes or so, each walking into the indention of the hedge and eventually leaving upset.

The last ex I chased through the orchard and wanted her to get home safe but she ran away from me. I walked after my ex down the dirt road of the orchard, still evening, with a sparse amount of apple trees dotting the roads.

I then encountered a friend and love interest (that didn't workout in real life) and she saw my ex running away from me while I walked after her.

""You killed her,"" my former love interest said to me. 

My ex ran the separate way and I began chasing my love interest trying to explain what had happened. She was walking ,controlling a remote control airplane she was flying for a child, but somehow walked faster than I ran. She walked out of the orchard and into a forest. I ran into the forest after her but her figure receded and the forest grew dark. 

Then I lost her and woke up.

The dream its self didn't feel ominous (i'll describe it below) and when I woke up I felt like I had been exposed to some other realm. Again, not in a bad way at all. I just felt really connected to everyone around me and had a lot less anxiety than normal that day. It was like, I was choosing to live in the physical world. Since then I felt like I've really gotten myself together; less anxiety, much better diet, less daydreaming and fantasizing and just living more in the moment. Even my relationship with my boyfriend seems a little stronger. But I keep worrying that the dream WAS an omen, since a lot of what i'm reading about grim reapers says its always a bad sign. It's in the back of my mind that someone is going to die or something's going to fall through. I can't help but be nervous about it so i'm wondering what you guys think! Here's how the dream went:

&#x200B;

I was standing inside this huge building with plants and terraces, like an indoor city, and I was seeing grim reapers walking around with people. Some of them were short and huddled over, some were tall, and I don't remember them actually having scythes, but every other aspect was exactly like a grim reaper. I remember seeing one that was acting kind of crazy, and realizing I was the only one seeing them I just wondered what was wrong with it. I don't know how, but something started describing to me what was going on. ""Each and every person has one. They are a lot like you, and they protect you until your time is up and they carry you to the afterlife."" So like the crazy grim reaper was following this guy who was definitely crazy himself. I felt their presence as friendly and kind of silly. I'm sure more happened in the dream but I don't remember. Right before I woke up I felt the urge to turn around, and when I did I saw my grim reaper. He wasn't in the same realm though, it was like I was looking through a portal. He was freakishly tall and surrounded by swirling earth tone colors like a painting. I felt myself smiling at him and we kind of had his mutual understanding. I felt like he was going to keep doing his job and that whatever happens in the future is meant to happen and I shouldn't stress about it...

But now I'm like ""OH GOD was that preparing me for someone to die?!?!?"" I've also read it can mean the end of habits, and I'm thinking, since I've had weird undiagnosed symptoms that doctors keep brushing off, that the dream may have meant an end to those things. I've started the Keto diet (i'm 4 days in) and it's done wonders for my mood and I haven't felt any of those weird symptoms, like dull headaches, always feeling lethargic, and random abdominal pain. I'm thinking I've cut out something i'm actually allergic to.. but for the first time in 2 years i feel NORMAL and back to my old self.

The whole body was withed and decayed as if it had been there for months, if not years. I cover it back up and panic, then try to call the cops to investigate the body, but I get stopped by this strange looking creature that looked like a cross between a typical Wendigo, a blue flat worm, and a lamprey.   

I do what anyone would do, and ran like hell to get away, and thankfully the creature gave no chase. Later on in the dream I learn that this creature has been eating people by sucking out all the moisture in their body. I also learn that I have to do a ritual to banish this monster from the mountain.  

Anyway, the time comes to perform the ritual, and I apparently had to do it outside of the next victims bedroom window at night. This is where things kind of get a bit...weird...So I am surrounded buy a circle of candles, with the forest and mountain looming ominously over head.

It wiggles and falls out onto the floor. At first I’m kind of shocked but then push my tongue up against my bottom row of teeth and notice they are wiggly as well. I think to myself “ hmm these are loose too, I might as well pull these ones out since I already lost one”. I pull those teeth out and they scatter on the floor. I scoop them up ( without looking at them) and walk into the bathroom. At this point in my dream I can feel the pain and can feel the spaces of where my teeth once were and as well as my gums. It feels very real. I walk up to the bathroom mirror and look into it, my top right tooth is missing and so is the first few on the bottom row. (In reality I have this one tooth on the bottom row of my mouth that kind of sticks out, regardless of years of braces and my commitment to my retainer) I think to myself as I look in the mirror at my gums “ well at least I don’t have that tooth sticking out anymore”. I look down at the teeth in my hands and they a rotten. Absolutely disgusting, they are orange, green and black and very realistic . I say out loud “ I need to miss my ballet class and go to the dentist so he can put my teeth back in”. One of my dance Professors  enters the bathroom and picks up one of my teeth from my palm and says “ these teeth are rotten, there is puss coming out of these, you can’t go to the dentist to get these put back in” while she twists the very soft and disgusting tooth ( it made this horrid sound that I cannot get out of my head). I leave the bathroom and go tell one of my other Professors that I will not be in class because I need to go to the dentist and that if I wait until the end of class that it will be too late to put these ones back in and that I would have to get fake teeth. She tells me that I need to wait until after her dance class and then I can go and that she finds it weird that I wouldn’t want fake teeth. The dream ends with me being at odds wether or not I should be in class or if I should go to the dentist to put the rotten teeth back into my mouth. 

I woke up gagging this morning because the sensation of not having teeth felt all too real. My teeth have felt weird all day, I have brushed them four times today. It’s really weighing on my mind and I cannot seems to come to any sort of conclusion. If anyone has any sort of interpretation I would really love to hear it!

The first time I had the dream, I had a baby, but it was really, really small. I'm talking size of a hamster small. Later on in the dream, I lose the baby. Now, when I say I lost it, I actually *misplaced it,* because it was so small. I want to say that dream was about a month ago, give or take. 

Last night, I had a similar dream. In this dream, a black woman didn't want her baby so the hospital said here have a baby adopt it. So I did. Just like the first dream, the baby was super, super small, and just like the last baby, I misplaced it, due to its small size. And in each dream I felt horrible for having misplaced it, like omg I'm a horrible mom.

I had a dream where a pack of black wolves attacked a town (I don’t know the people but there were families) in waves. We had time between the waves to prep but it didn’t feel like enough. There were people on their way to help us but they weren’t idk suited for the job and they never really got there. 

Any ideas or thoughts? 

Oh yeah a lot of people died in the first wave. They were seriously ripping people (all ages) to shreds. But it seemed like the natural thing for them to do and I kept trying to figure out where they’d come from. 

I added the flair nightmare but I had control over my own faculties and I was sort of switching into different perspectives/people. So it wasn’t as scary for me. I was worried for the others tho.

So month is over and I'm being lead out, again by my grandparents. We get in this elevator and these three boys had spilled bird seed everywhere. So I just start kinda helping them sweep it up and then they arrest me again! So I get out the second time and both my friends and were like 
""That sucked let's not do that again."" 
Then I'm at the store, I have my headphones in and I'm minding my own business. This cop says something to me but I dont hear it so I take out my headphones and ask what he said and he arrested me again! As I got out the final time my mother kept saying how disappointed she was and I was fired from my job. After that i never left my bed and just decided that my life was over. Then my friends told me the first time we were arrested was because the cop just wanted to ""show those pesky teens that they dont rule the world"" or some crap. Then I just laid in bed till I starved to death.

I have a recurring dream which has been going on for a few years and it's driving me nuts. A bit of relevant background about my life:  For 9 years of my life, through college and university I had a part time job at a crappy theme park near my home, on weekends and holidays. The job I had before that I had hated every minute of it, and while I can't say I liked this new job, it was a small step up. The job itself was okay, the pay was minimum wage and my boss, while not a bad person could be a bit of a arse at times. I did not enjoy the job, but it was bearable most of the time even if it was boring.  


I studied computing at university. I passed just fine but I didn't particularly enjoy it nor was I particularly good at any of it. I couldn't see myself getting a job in anything I'd studied, I was sure I'd just end up working in a shop or something for the rest of my life.  


I stuck with my part time job at the theme park when I finished, while applying for all sorts of full time jobs - mostly just secretarial and admin stuff, nothing that exciting or would become a career. One time a job came up as a web designer and I applied thinking I had no chance but whatever, I'll send my CV over. They asked me for an interview and I can remember clearly standing outside hoping it went alright. For the first time ever I was going for an interview for a job I actually really wanted. I had no real idea why they were interviewing me, surely there are better qualified people for the role, both in terms of academic achievements and experience.  


Long story short, I got the job. Five years later I'm still here and doing incredibly well. I am excellent at my job (and not to sound big headed but doing much better than some colleagues who have been here much longer and/or have actually studied web design). My bosses are lovely people who are very pleased with my work. I *enjoy* my job. The pay isn't amazing but it's not too shabby either. I'm learning new skills. Despite not understanding why they hired me originally and attributing a huge amount of it to luck, I have no feelings of inadequacy here. Yes it's a great job, much better than I thought I'd ever have, but I deserve it, I'm very good at it as it turns out.  


However, I keep having recurring dreams I'm back at my old job. The dream itself is different every time but the premise is the same. I haven't gone back in time in my dream, I'm still aware that I've had this great job as a web designer, but for some unknown reason I'm working back at my old job. I'm never aware I've lost my old job, it's just that for some reason I'm working my old job at the weekend. I had one last night and one of my current work colleagues was there with me (although that doesn't normally happen). There's a kind of bittersweet feeling to the dream - it's kind of weird but nice to be back at my old job just this once, but I've got a better job than this, why am I back here?  


The dream has been popping up every now and then for the past few years, so there is obviously some psychological reason for it, but I can't figure out why. I don't feel inadequate - I'm very good at my job. I also don't fear losing my job - my bosses really like me and if they had to kick someone out it wouldn't be me. If I did lose my job I feel confident I'd be able to get a similar one somewhere else.

Just go check and see who it is. So I went there and opened his door, and at first I just peeked my head in and closed it real fast. Then I was like wtf am I hesitating for so I opened it again and heard water running and saw all his lights on. I walked to his bathroom and the tub water was running but it hadn’t over flowed or anything but in general the bathroom was really messy and for some reason I noticed my work pants on the ground. Then I went to his bed and saw a single assault rifle just SITTING there. (Side-note: I don’t hate guns, but personally I’m not a fan of them and even seeing one irl or touching one would make me really uncomfortable) so I’m just like wtf and kind of freaking out but for some reason I was like okay let me just put it in his closet. So I go to his closet and start looking for a space for this assault rifle and when I get there I see a BUNCH of other different kinds assault rifles in the closet so I kind of just shove the one I’m holding somewhere trying to avoid touching anything that might set it off by accident. Then when I go back to his room and lift his sheet I see multiple other assault rifles just sitting there and I’m like what the heck is going on! So then I finally see a note and it looks like it’s been marked over multiple times to make a bunch of corrections to it. It appears to have been signed by some random gun dealer that knew my brother and basically the gist of it is, “Hey I talked to your brother and they told me that you and your dad don’t own a gun. It’s always good to have guns around so I’d like to invite you to come learn how to shoot, etc.” basically something like that. And in my head I’m thinking okay if my brother got these why the hell would he just leave them laying in my dad’s bed so carelessly like this. Overall, I’m just confused by the dream and I wonder if I should look at the dream at face value or go for a deeper interpretation. 

Some quick insight on me: I’m a 20 year old girl that lives in Texas, I can be a bit of an anxious and indecisive person... I don’t really know what all to include abt me tbh 

My dad is 70, and he had a stroke two months ago on this exact day but he has fully recovered now the day he had a stroke I was actually the one who found him in his room mid stroke, he’s retired so he’s in his room at home a lot and my siblings and I worry about him a lot and try and force him to be more active

I began to escape while he was readying the weapon, I had enough time to get away to what I thought would be a safe distance. the building I was in reminded me of the game portal, similar colours, white panels and glass, kind of spartan a bit desolate, I could see outside of the building through the glass and it looked like a regular kind of town. not somewhere I recognised though. I got far enough away that I thought I could relax, the building was now a type of school I ran in to a classroom and quietly blended in with everyone trying not to raise any alarm. for the first time in a long time I dreamed of being school and it didn't bother me, I often dream of school but it makes me very uncomfortable. 

I moved to the front next to the teacher facing the class I then saw people running from the direction I ran from, panicking and chaos starting. they were running for their lives I tried to remain calm thinking we were safe but as I saw more people running out of the building and scared. I began to realise I needed to get away. I was then aware that this laser beam was now becoming an apocalyptic scenario. it was spinning around in circles and getting closer in waves, by incinerating each wall that was between me and it creating a circle of destruction from the epicentre that I ran from, it was searching for me but seemed completely indiscriminate and was intent on destroying everything in its path. 

I ran out of the building and towards a nearby town. I thought I was safe here again. but then I was made aware that it was once again catching up with me. at this point my location returned back to the building, I could see what the bad guys were doing and plotting, they were turning their attention to a chain of passenger airplane flights that were crossing the sky. the reasoning was that someone could be escaping on these planes from the laser's destruction, but they were destroying every one that crossed the path overhead. I don't really remember the end of the dream too well but I was in another part of the building with a woman, I was told she was part of the bad guys. she was confronting me.

beeping. I was in a hospital, my mom was beside me

they were trying to help me learn to walk again and

eat and talk and the basic of human culture.

a girl on the left a girl in the middle to the right

then two boys being placed in the remaining chairs.

It could have been an arcade maybe? Idk. I had to go pee, so I got up and made for the public toilets, and the toilets were very strange. It was a unisex toilet (which IRL are usually really small with only 2 toilet stalls in them and I've got no problem with using them) and the whole room was laid out really strangely. All of the toilets were weirdly shaped and sized, some of them had a smaller vestigial toilet coming out the back of it, some of them appeared to be made of those see-through electronics we loved in the 90's, and they were all **out in the open.** The stalls all had showers in them instead like it was the bathroom of a public swimming pool, and the toilets instead were just... **out.** I finally found one that had a little shower curtain I could pull around to cover myself up, but as I sat down, the drawn curtain was a) much closer to my face than I would have liked and b) didn't cover my ass and legs, just my waist up. There was a young man sitting opposite me (I'm a woman, for context) and another two people were loudly having a conversation somewhere in the room. I tried very hard to relieve myself for a long time, and I think in the dream I managed to get some pathetic squirts out, which then somehow got all over the floor instead of actually in the toilet. When I flushed, a wave of water washed the pee into what looked like a bathtub trenched into the ground. Everything smells like pee and I'm very upset at this point.

I finally go back out to meet back up with my friends, after what felt like hours, and they're all looking very bored and restless. I overhear a little bit over conversation, not directed at me and likely not meant for me to hear, that they've missed something that they'd been looking forward to seeing/doing by waiting hours for me to piss. I feel absolutely terrible by this point, and we all split up to carpool home. It's nighttime in the dream now. I'm sitting in the front passenger seat and the driver's girlfriend is sitting behind me, for some reason. The driver offers me a tiny, thimble-sized shotglass filled with a pale yellowish-greenish liquid. I ask him what it is and he mumbles something incomprehensible, and being too shy to ask him to repeat himself, I just take the shot and swallow it. The substance has an incredibly sour taste and its effects are immediate, making the neon signs and lights outside brighter and prettier and move about like I'm inside a kaleidoscope.

I pick up and he frantically tells me that he's been trying to call me for hours and hours and hadn't had any idea where I was.

The dream began where I observed myself inspecting this massive floating ball of water. There was an old rough looking bearded man there with me (his presence felt like a mentor or teacher). He never says a word but I act as if he's just given me a task or trial. In the water  things start to pop into existence and float there. First there are inanimate things; a wooden chair, a bowl, and I think maybe some sort of fruit? I don't move. Then people begin to appear. They float inside and struggle to find a surface to swim to. I immediately dive in (up?) And pull them out to safety.  This repeats with various kinds of people in increasing numbers and I manage to save them all but I get the sense that the teacher isn't satisfied. Then an single infant appears and flails around with no understanding of how to save itself but when I dive in (up?) I cannot orient myself in the water. In inanimate objects bump into me and block the infant from view. It's as though I'm swimming in place like the people I saved previously. It strikes me that if I keep trying e will both drown. As soon as I think this, I can move and I swim out to save myself. The infant drowns and I am devastated but the old man seems satisfied. The ball of water falls and spreads out over the ground like a mirror (think the salt flats) and reflects the blue sky so the earth and sky seem like on thing with only a mountainous horizon separating them in all directions. The scene shifts again and the pair of us are flying at impossible speeds along this mirrored ground close enough that I can reach out a hand and skim the surface causing a ripple. I am elated and my teacher seems happy but reserved as he follows. As the mountains come closer, a golden twinkle at one of the tallest peaks catches my eye. It is a colossal golden hand open with its palm toward the sky (For anyone familiar with Disney's Aladdin and the King of Thieves, thing the floating golden hand that holds the hand of Midas).

By this time, we are in the back of the store going down the shower curtain and towel isle. We slowly walked through, then turned around and walked back up the isle next to it. This guy was there stocking the shelves. 
In my wake, he is a student that goes to university with me and a year younger. 
We made eye contact, and I quickly looked away. He went ahead and wandered back to what he way doing. He wasn't in any uniform, but I did see an employee nametag like object on his shirt. I remember thinking, ""Wait, he works ____, not here?"" 
My mother was several steps ahead with the basket, and we were fixing to leave the isle. A voice in my head was yelling at me for not saying something, but I felt like I had missed my chance because the air had already become awkward. Finally, I took in a breath before turning to speak, and he spoke up first.
""You know, one of my friends knew someone who went through the same procedure-said it was pretty painful."" He said, not once taking his eyes off of the shelves. I froze and slowly turned my head. I remember feeling a moment of panic after realizing he had heard my conversation since he was just on the isle next to us. 
He then took the last object to shelve in his hands before saying something along the lines of, ""But, I happen to like all of those things anyways...""
He flashed me a smile, and I remember feeling a rise of hope in me. 
After that, the dream fast forward through a couple conversations. I learned that he was working their part time since his other job wasn't giving him enough hours. I asked him about a test in class that we had that last week, and he said that he had to turn in a video instead because his work wouldn't reschedule since he was a recent hire. He said he thought it went well, though. We exchanged goodbyes, and I returned to my mother and we left the isle as he shelved the last item. 


My mother never said much, her expressions were actually very bland. I live at home still, so I figured it was just an insert since I couldn't talk to the wall.
The guy on the otherhand, I noticed him a couple of times this year-as I had never seen him before and new faces don't appear in the middle of a 4yr degree that often. We've only talked once. He's very attractive, and he always appears to have a smile and a lot of energy with his friends. Upbeat.  I saw him working one time when I was out with friends, so that's how I knew that.  I guess I was just wondering what everyone else thought of this dream. I don't want to read too much into it.
Any help would be great!

This dream probably has nothing to do with any of this though, because it's all about things I'm personally interested in; films, mafia, advanced technologies, etc. 

this dream is a real strange one, i’ve tried interpreting it but it seems too detailed to be a dream about change or events. My dream begins by browsing youtube, it looks like 2009 youtube because there wasn’t any gaming videos floating around. i stumbled upon a video called “If only a bear could kill (part 1/5) in it, it’s set up like a documentary, it’s about the real events pertaining to a film The Rock starred in recently, along with Weslie Snipes, and director John Landis. What happens? it makes no sense. In the video, 2 cops are approaching a scene where cops are everywhere about to blow this bear away, the bear had completely destroyed this house, furniture and wood everywhere yet no bodies were seen anywhere. I thought “well, i guess this bear sucks at killing people “ until some narrator voice goes on to say “The man who Dwaine acts as is found miles away on a raft in a river. Cops retrieve him and find out he’s been heavily sedated. Why is this?” and suddenly it feels like some sort of conspiracy typa deal, where it continues to show the bear was placed at his home by some mafia types. And the guy who supposedly The Rock is acting as, the dude literally looks like him only except he’s darker and shorter. The retrieve him and bring him to the bear, where he avoids getting attacked and saves his kids (the real guy) but then it shows the alleged film, the narrator continues, “In the hit film, we see how nearly exact they execute the scenes with the use of advanced robotics technologies to make the bear seem as real as the real thing. 

i wake up for an hour and fall back asleep where i dream of watching part 2, but i never saw what the other 3 videos were about. 

in the second part, come to find out The Rock and John Landis split the costs for the Advanced robot technology and they came under fire from the Mafia (the ones who sicked a bear on the guy), they were at an award ceremony, but the weird thing is that John and the Rock weren’t even shook by these Italians who were heavily armed and threatening them. The robot comes out and fucking kills the mafia guys in mere seconds, it was vicious and brutal and John and the Rock laughed their asses off. Then it cuts back to the events of what happened to the family. they hid in the bathroom while the bear tore apart the house, the guy was put on this raft days earlier because he didn’t pay back his debts or something. it ends there, not abruptly but i was sweating upon waking up, and i always remember my dreams, which is why im able to share this.

While falling you could feel your stomach curling up and feel the air as you fell faster and faster as you saw the road/black concrete fastly approach.

-

The first dream that intrigued me is a common dream almost everyone has; the lose/falling tooth. I've read a lot about it. Some say it's about losing something or a new change in your life. I got a lot of dreams like this, probably like 3-5 times. I could say it's mostly changes in life, no death event related fortunately. 

-

What bothers me is that the dream I had is that I was the one pulling my own tooth (buck tooth to be exact). It started off me feeling some of my teeth a lose just by using my tongue. I got frustrated and pulled it off right away. Again, this dream scene captures me in a bathroom looking at the mirror. I still remember seeing my own face after pulling my tooth. 

-

My second dream...or a nightmare to be precise showed me a different perspective that I never thought I would feel, a family member suicide death. The 'victim' was my dad apparently. The dream started off me doing casual thing (I can't remember what I was doing) but I got a phone call. I picked it up and heard my dad's voice. He sounds stressed and agitated like he can't take the pressure anymore. It was so sudden. He told me that he is going to kill himself and I can't do anything about it cuz the phone he was using was untraceable. He told me he left something for the family (money I guess). I told him ""Wait dad, no. Stop. Don't do th-"" ***BAM! ***...  A gun shot was the last thing I heard from the call. 

-

I was stunned for 5 seconds. I tried to soak in what just happened. The call was like less than 15 seconds too. I finally hang up the phone. For some reason, I just ended up giving my dad wants, to not let anyone find him (cuz he said his phone untraceable). I was just emotionless but it felt so wrong to just stay quite about it like it was nothing. 

Later on, I don't know why, my brother died to an accident. I was in my home when I heard the news from my sister. I told her about dad's suicide like it was nothing. There was no reaction but she was just casual smiling. Next to her was my brother, my DEAD brother in ghost form. He casually wave to my sister and goes to the kitchen to get some food. I followed him for some reason. As he was picking up milk from the fridge, I couldn't help myself but cry behind him and weep on the floor while mourning his name. Yet, he was still smiling. 

-

When I wake up from that dream/nightmare, I thought to myself...was I the ghost in my brother and sister's POV? Why didn't I cried for my dad but I cried for my brother? 

-

Lastly, this 3rd dream showed me a world of schizophrenia, an illness that makes you hear voices around you. I don't have this illness irl but I've been wanting to understand how it feels like. It started with me going to my house, a weird looking version of my house. Inside, there was a clueless girl doing chores inside. I don't know her but she was harmless. She mentioned about she needs to get rid of something before dusk but she can't remember what it was. She continues cleaning  furniture. I don't know what it was top but later on, I found a basket full of toys in the living room. I picked up a toy duck. 

-

For some reason, I hear a whisper from the duck. I put it near my ear and the duck say something really morbid and negative. I was horrified. I made sure I didn't hear it from the duck only, I picked up the other toys in the basket too. Most of them have faces - action figurines and doll mostly. 

They all were whispering bad stuff. I immediately snap their necks to kill them. I shout to call the girl. I ran to her and I placed one of the toys near her ear and she heard it too. Her eyes widen and it was like she finally remembers what was she supposed to do. We both ended up snapping toys' neck and gathered them in the same basket. 

-

We didn't managed to snap all of them but we ended up burning them all in the front yard across the house. The sky was almost dark too, meaning we managed to do it on time perhaps. We both seems happy as far as I remembered.

The shapeless figure began to take forms, first a crow and than a finch. As I choked on the word “Jesus” the figure formed the head of a grinning wolf revealing its teeth to me. The shadow would then take the form of the finch as before, but slowly distorted into a half human face and began to open and close its beakish mouth as the sound “tweet, tweet, tweet” rung through my ears.

We have chemistry, you and I. We are so alike. Bold, brave, and never giving into the world. But we’re also so different; maybe in some ways that I could never know. I think that makes us right. Right for each other. We have our similarities and our differences, but that’s a good thing. We can grow to understand one another, learn new perspectives and fall deeper as we go. It’s been a long time since we last spoke.

Last night, I dreamt of you. It was dark out and it was just us two. Poolside with dim lights. You were on one end and I on the other. Distant, but aware. You walked from one side to the other side. I slowly fell into the water, almost like a predator stalking its prey. You were aware. You were now in the water by the corner with the steps. I realize I had gone into the deep side and begin to suffocate. I cannot swim. I fight and lunge upwards, trying to reach the shallow end. I make my way and catch my breath as I swim slowly to you. You looked ashamed. I felt it, too. But I also knew you wanted us. We both knew it. It was just me and you then. All alone in the world. Two souls swimming in an ocean of nothingness. Circling eternal. I take your hand and pull you closer. We caress and everything seems to disappear. No troubles, no pain, no guilt. As we make our love, I can feel your body warm beside mine. I’m inside you. All I can see you. In what seemed like a lifetime, we tumbled and pushed. Both, in ecstasy. Then…climax. Drenched. Breathing. We pause for a second. We knew what it was. It can never happen again. We are so far apart, almost in different worlds. Vibrating on the same wavelength, but living in entirely different realities. I wake. My eyes closed, slowly coming to realization. What time is it? Why did I wake? Why couldn’t I stay? I love her. Why did she leave? The alarm goes off. Dreams. Another dream. Another dream turned nightmare.

Now it haunts me. The fantasy that I so longed for is exactly what it was. Fantasy. I know I’m right. You and I were destiny. But alas, not all things come to be. I know that now and I must accept it. It’s not right for me to prioritize my happiness over yours. What we had is just that, something we had. I wish we could’ve been more. I wish we’d lasted longer. Even forever maybe. It does hurt when I see you with him. But I know you’re happy. I’d rather be across the ocean and know you're happy than to never see you smile again.

>I dreamt that I was at my mother’s hillbilly hometown. It was night.  We (?) were all in the living room of my grandmother’s house. However,  near the birdcage by the door there were more cages with more birds,  which were parakeets.

>  
>The entrance of her house looked different. The part  that consisted of the stairs, the barbecue place and the garden irl were  all turned into dirt instead. The house had more floors and was taller  than irl. In the place that led to a tall wall with the garden on top  there was a pile of dirt, a wooden storage shed and a dog chained.  
>  
>The  place where the wood was stored irl had dissapeared, the neighbours  house next door and the ground around the barbecue place (which had also  disappeared) was made of dirt instead of tar. Everything else was also  dirty with dirt.  
>  
>The dog looked like the dog she had irl at the  time (a Serra da Estrela shepherd), but older, thinner and taller. It’s  mouth drooped, it’s fur was longer and lighter and it was silkier, not  as messy as irl. Where the fur was black irl in the dream it was white.  It looked like a mix between her dog irl and another dog called Noddy  from my horseback riding school.

>For some reason I walked up to  the dog first, but he didn’t recognize me and growled. He was on top of a  pile of dirt, in front of the wooden house. I remember that there was a  dark wooden (christian) cross on the ground. There was a thin metallic  chain near it. On the ground there was a tangle of wires.

Might be relevant to add that this being and I later had ""sex"" (actually it was more like rolling in the bed naked with little genital contact, if any. I don't remember getting any sexual feeling from it). Might also be relevant to add that I am hetero-romantic asexual and that I always know I am dreaming (during dreams. I always could do it, idk how).

Dream: A family feud

Places: Grandmother’s home, My mother’s home, a place in the hills, among pines and enormous bird nests of falcons.

I’m at my grandmother’s home, though the exterior world is clearly my old home in Summer Knoll. What’s this thing in the back yard? It’s taking up so much space, I couldn’t have missed that. It’s an entire house, with its own toolshed in the 'backyard' of it. The presence of the small home was an organizational nightmare, so I had to investigate. I went inside the home and the people within warned me to leave. The people who lived there weren’t bad people, but this living situation was very claustrophobic. They had children and aspirations of expansion, of utilizing the property extensively. I wanted them to leave but it appeared that this would be a legal dispute. Somehow or another I’d completely missed something of the past, and these people were possibly rightful owners of the space, and so I had to clean things up and receive a final word of truth from the Law.

Now beyond the house, on the hill, the landscape stretches far out. It gains in complexity and unfamiliarity, until it resembles more of an idea of a place I’d been before. The hill crest, the pine forest walling around a meadow. Birds of prey tend to enormous nests in the barren late Autumn oaks and maples. On the meadow is a hill, over which is a home, and a family business. The family is rich and complex, but neurotic and incredibly toxic. Their feuds reach a breaking point as chaos spills out. From another angle there is a suburban neighborhood, and it is Summer Knoll. Here is where I watch from my grandmother’s window, from a distance not quite safe enough. I think that my own property dispute was a result of this dispute on the hill, while the chaos grows until it spreads onto the streets, into other homes. There are several police officers and a crowd of people all representing different elements of the family. People are thrown to the ground, some are held back by four or five men, others flee into the adjacent yards or the road, I think I see fire, or an explosion. It is there hidden almost like an allegory. 

In the garage with my aunt, preparing something. We are getting ready for something that is to happen. A journey? Defense from all the now-criminals loose in the neighborhood?

I told people my idea and how I would do it and how it works but all I got was ""that's impossible you can't do that it's not gonna work blah blah blah.""

Whatever, on to my dream: it was like a found tape style thing of me, many years in the future with facial hair, wrinkles, grey hairs, etc. (probably forty or fifty years old) and I was in some sort of lab. Behind me were two large mechanical pillars covered with wires/cables/circuit boards and each one had a door on it. I tiredly hold up a piece of paper with some gibberish written on it (can other people read in dreams? I can't ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) and I say ""this is Doctor (don't put your last name on the internet), it is currently March 5th, 20(muffled). This is the Inverse Time by Acceleration Test number 45..."" While I'm sayng this, in the background some lab assistants are helping a man in a white jumpsuit and orange gloves get inside one of the pillars. I turn and say over an intercom, hiding my sadness, ""alright Norm, bud, ya ready?"" ""Ready than ever Doc!"" With a heavy look on my face, I tell my assistants to get in position and start a countdown. After 1, I pull the large handle on the control pad in front of me. A massive blast of light emerges from nowhere and then.... static. Nothing else happened. The dream is over. The experiment was a failure. Another man is dead.

I dreamt that I was on a futuristic college campus. The only class I had to go to that day was a science class(I'm definitely not a science major). On my way there, I saw two guys. They were both the same height. One had blonde hair, the other had black hair and black painted nails (I knew that the black haired guy was someone I currently have a bit of a crush on out of dream world, but I have no idea who the blonde haired person is supposed to be).

Those two guys walked on either side of me the whole way. Then, some sort of terrible event happened (I don't remember what it was specifically). The black haired guy seemed broken by the event. he backed away from the situation. The blond haired guy took control of the situation and I was amazed by it. I did nothing in this tragedy.

When I reached class, my high school science teacher was teaching the class and it was filled with high school students. I lost one of my textbooks in the group of hormonal teenagers and had to chase after it. The black haired guy and the blond haired guy were there. The black haired guy saw me struggling and turned in his chair, but he seemed ashamed that he didn't help me. The blond haired guy picked the book up, handed it to me, and helped me off the ground, and then returned to his seat. I took my seat in between these two people.

After the class was over, I sat in this circular garden thing and studied. The blond haired guy was on one side, just standing. The black haired guy was on the other side doing the same thing.

Then, I saw someone on top of a building. It was a girl in my class who died in a car crash when I was in high school. I never talked to her, but from what I heard about her, very few people liked her because she was a jerk.

She slowly leaned forward and jumped off the building. She was killed instantly on impact and I think there was an explosion in the background.  I was the only one who saw this happening and started panicking. I broke down and started bawling. I couldn't move. I saw the gruesome scene that was her body. It was very obvious she couldn't take the stress caused by college and just ended it all.

The black haired guy backed away, like the first tragedy. The blond haired guy went to see if he could help in any way after getting over the initial shock of the event. Once ambulances arrived, he backed away and walked toward me. He put a jacket over me to cover my panicking and bawling from the public and he held me until I calmed down.

I had a dream that I got a tattoo on my leg from some person I don't recognize. He gave me an uncomfortable vibe, like he was dangerous or was capable of murdering me. Strangely, he gave me the most nonsense tattoo (it was all cute-looking images, sadly I only remember a cute cartoon/anime/chibi hamster and panda bear) and the way he did it was ""ironing"" it onto my skin. I felt pain during the dream but I had to sit through it because I had to commit to the tattoo. I remember conversing with him but not of what. Only thing I felt was I had to say things in a gentle but persuading manner (I.e., like in cases where a person is trying to persuade a psycho serial killer to not kill him/her).
Before I know it, the tattoo I was getting had changed from being put on my leg to my forehead... Plus the tattoo had changed! It was all colorful and sparkly now and looks more like stickers than anything. I don't remember what was on my temples, but I remember three giant stars on my forehead in red, white, and blue. As I was walking out, I asked how much I owe him and he said $900. I was worried about where to get the money and that I shouldn't have got a forehead tattoo. I looked in my reflection and saw my bangs barely covering it and thought that at least it's covered and that I'd have to always have my hair long with bangs to cover it up until I can afford to laser it off.


About self: Female in early 30s, have one tattoo that I love and do not regret getting, I work in a hospital and currently just applied to another place as prn to try to make some extra cash here and there to pay off debts. I know I'm a worrier, I always worry I'm not doing a good job, if I said something wrong, or if I did something wrong.

0.0,a0bl2n,3.0,3.0,"This dream is told in the point of view of my wife who just recently had this dream again and we’ve no idea what it could mean.

I’ve been having this dream irregularly ever since I was a child. It always starts and ends the same.
I’m in a castle, similar to Dracula’s, on a sheer cliff face. It has huge windows in the bedroom I always wake up in at the start of the dream. I’m wearing a white gown as well. It’s night-time but the moon is huge and bright. So I leave the room and head down the same hallway to find out where I am. I find a doorway that leads out to the stone balcony of the castle. There’s a waterfall below the balcony that I cannot see the bottom of. The balcony is extremely long and it wraps around the other side of the castle. So I follow the balcony around to try and find another doorway. The moment I turn the corner I notice that the black knight is behind me about a hundred feet away just walking.

   Before I continue I need to describe the knight because I remember how he looks (as well as everything else in the dream) so vividly. 
The knight is huge, easily 7 feet tall with the top of my head touching his clavicle. He is covered head to toe in armor and I can’t see any human features on him. He has a very classic knight like helmet. It’s a lot like the knight helmet from Dark souls. Except this one has a black plume on the back. The entire set of armor is black iron. Barely any shine. The chest piece has a Fleur de Lys on the lower right side of the plate and a skull on the upper left side of his chest. His gauntlets are pointed and sharp at the finger tips. The weapon he holds is a solid black halberd with an extremely long and sharp tip.
 
   When I look ahead of me again I see my family members standing on the balcony staring at the moon. They appear entranced by it and are all wearing white gowns as well. No matter how much I try to get their attention they won’t move or even listen to me. All I see when I look into their eyes is the reflection of the moon. Eventually I start to notice the knight has gotten closer. By the time I’ve attempted to get my third family member’s attention he’s standing behind my grandmother(every single time I have this dream she is always first but the order of other family members changes). He stabs her in the back through her chest with the halberd and throws her off the balcony. She doesn’t scream or cry out. She just bleeds. He then moves to my next family member and does the same thing. One by one he stabs them and throws them over the stone railing as I try to shake them out of their trance. I run away after he kills my last family member and he slowly stalks towards me. He never runs. 
  I find another door and run back inside. No matter how hard I try to find an exit there is no way out. Every room I come across has furniture with white linens. The knight is always just a little closer every time I turn and see him. When I’ve reached a dead end I have to hide inside one of the rooms. I hear him approach the door and he begins to slam on it. Eventually the banging stops and I back away from the door and grab a candle stick on the nightstand. It was already lit and it’s always in the same spot. The moment I pick up the candle and turn around he’s standing right in front of me, he grabs my throat and all I feel is the cold metal, and then I wake up. 
   The weirdest part for me is that my grandmother was first even before and after her actual death.

My first dream took place in the alps or a mountainous place and a cougar was loose, although I never saw it. We were just aware of the danger in the village.  I remember I was about to help my separated husband take soil samples for his work, and warned my family to stay indoors because of a loose cougar on the prowl in the village. 

The second dream took place outdoors and I had my two dogs with me and my separated husband. There were people sitting on bleachers with their own dogs, although there were also people with wild animals like panthers, and a tiger. They weren’t attacking people or the other dogs that were there although I was petrified they would attack my dogs. We decided to take refuge at an attic in a barn and I was the last one going up the stairs when a tiger attempted to attack me to no avail.

The third dream, and the most recent dream took place in a motel room. Wild animals were roaming the outside area of the motel which appeared to be a gigantic park. I opened the motel door from the inside, looked outside and saw this grizzly bear chasing a small animal that was running towards our motel room and just as I was about to close the door, the animal it was chasing got in. Luckily I managed to close the door after pushing it with everything I had while the bear was trying to get in. Everyone that I loved was in the motel sleeping and I was yelling for help so that they would wake up but they would not wake up. They were all asleep soundly. I was afraid for my dogs. I then looked outside the window and saw a family of four being attacked by a tiger. The father shielded his wife and kids as they were being attacked. 

I am not sure what this all means. If any of you guys can help me interpret the dreams and why I am dreaming about wild animals imposing a threat (some sort of threat). It would be appreciated.

To give a background, most of the people I love are present in those dreams, including my family members. One who is usually always there is my separated husband. ",hot,Same themed dreams with wild animals recurring over and over,2.0

I’ve had this happen to me in dreams for years now. It’s never the same dream but whatever I’m doing in the dream my mouth will continually fill with a chunky white substance not unlike a tonsil stone and i will spit the contents into my hand and dispose of it somewhere. 

In the dream I’m usually annoyed by this and wishing it would just stop but I’m not alarmed by it. It doesn’t taste bad or smell bad. People around me will ask if I’m okay and I’ll respond exasperated like “yes I’m fine this stuff just keeps filling my mouth” no one seems disgusted by it or think it’s odd. 

Sometimes i will try to reach in and attempt to remove the chunks before they fill my mouth in an effort to give myself more time between spitting but this will often result in me grabbing on to a white, stringy substance that will catch in the back of my throat and the harder i pull on it the more it will feel like I’m going to rip my throat out.

Nodding and thanking someone for telling me about a nonexistant class project.  And then last night, being upset because a classmate didn’t respect my appreciation for a movie.

The dream started that I was travelling to my home through the desert in a car. I arrived and found that there were lots of pets in my home and found two rabbits in my dining room. I played with one of them for a bit and when I noticed I hadn’t seen the other one in a while I went looking. I found the rabbit in the toilet which had yellow water and immediately pulled it out and went to clean it up, especially around its face and ears. 

After I had finished cleaning I started giving birth right there, but it wasn’t painful at all asides from the contractions. I gave birth to a blonde and black haired, blue eyed baby girl (my boyfriend and I have dark brown eyes and only my dads side have blueish green eyes). The hair was in such a way that if you lifted the blonde hair up you would find a couple of black strands here and there.

I started taking photos of her and sent them to my LDR boyfriend over Line (a messaging app we use). I saw that he had read the messages but he wasn’t replying so I started to feel worried that he wasn’t happy with our baby.

I then left the bathroom which lead into a tropical hotel room. I breastfed my baby and she went to sleep so I went and joined my family and friends for dinner (which included my dad who passed away in 2015) and everyone was excited about the baby and was giving me gifts and asking to see her. I went and got her after three hours, worried she might be upset, but she was happily cooing to herself. 

I came out of my hotel room and now I was in an apartment that was supposedly in Japan but the outside of the window looked like a European town, and it was hot and humid.

The dream started in a lecture. There were those reclining movie seats and my friends were  attending the lecture with me. The lecture turned out to be a movie. Once the lights turned off, the professor ran over to me and sat in the same seat as me. Then I willingly started snuggling up to him. Whenever I tried to move though, he pushed me back down and said “shh. It’s fine. Just keep lying down” 
He then proceeded to start grabbing my butt and I was perfectly fine with it. 

Nobody around me noticed that this was happening. 

After the lecture was over and everyone left, we proceeded to do some adult activities, right there on some tables. Which, weirdly enough, I somehow blurred out from my dream?? Like, my brain did some sort of movie transition over the whole sex stuff. After he was finished, he pulled out some money and gave it to me. My dream self was confused but appreciative of the money. I had no idea that any money transaction was going to be taking place, I though everything was just for fun. 

I should also note that even though my dream self consented to everything that happened, it felt like I didn’t.

The whole dream was really ""real"" and played out like I expect this situation would IRL. I cried, a lot. I was surrounded by family and friends. My girlfriend was comforting me and my dad flew over for the funeral. My grandma was there and I was given a few weeks off work by my boss. It was all so real and nothing ""out of the world"" about it. I don't remember too many details apart from what I've already said. The only other thing is that when I asked how she died, It was something to do with her heart and it happened in her sleep.   

I woke up feeling shitty and like it had actually happened in a weird way. I had to call my mum and just have a general chat with her to calm myself down a little. I didn't mention anything to her obviously but that kind of helped.    

That night I went to bed and if I dreamt, I didn't remember anything, Like most nights. I hardly ever remember my dreams, It's so rare and when I do it's 99% nightmares.    

The night after that, so two days from the original dream, I went to sleep again. This time It was a continuation from the initial dream where my mum had died. Except it was after the funeral by a couple of weeks. My closest friends and Girlfriend had taken me on holiday to clear my head a little bit. We were in Italy, I have no idea why it was Italy and there were no Signs that it was Italy but somehow I just knew it was. Everyone was trying to cheer me up and again, It played out like I imagine it would in really life. Everything was normal, the way the public were acting on the street, the hostel we were in...everything.   

After a few days there, I was driving a van for some reason with my girlfriend in it and we had an argument and she proceeded to get out the van and storm off in a huff. We had shared location things on each others phone for some reason So I could see where she was. It said she was in a coach on her way to the airport. So I raced her there, got to the check in queue and stopped her asking wtf is she doing. She started having a go at me and whilst we were arguing in the airport lobby, I got woken up by her coming home from work.    

I'm pretty freaked out, I've never heard of a continuation dream before. Is this a common thing?

I'm finally forced to jump behind these machines even though I know there's no way to get out from back there. So I do it.

Anyway, this happened last night and right now im wide awake and unable to fall asleep until i have gotten this out of my mind. I dont remember what was happening in my dream before i went to sleep in the dream. But what i was dreaming within my dream was kind of weird. 

It started off with me in my parent’s room taking a bath (the only room in the house with a bathtub). I couldnt stay afloat and kept slipping as i was trying to get out of the bathtub. That triggered me to wake up out of my dream within my dream, but i managed to fall back asleep in my dream. 

The dream continued to after i got out of the bathroom after the bath, i come out to a very pretty girl laying on my parent’s bed looking very seductive. She had a pet dog with the mouth of what i could only describe as that which resembled the elites from halo (LOL) very creepy. It bit my finger and wouldnt let go, while it was biting me, the girl ran out of the room.  Struggling with the bite triggered me to wake up again but managed to fall back asleep.
I now returned to my dream, finally able to free myself from that dog’s bite and walked out of my parents room towards my room (at the end of the hall to the right). Before i could reach the end of the hall, the girl from before comes out of my brothers computer room (across my room. So end of the hall but to the left) half naked with a bunch of deformed and demonic looking cats. Idk why but i decide to pet one and it ends up biting me and then i end up waking up for good.

Anyone can help me with this interpretation? 

Little background about my past 2 weeks have mostly been about: going sober from drugs and quitting smoking.

I was at a house party type deal at a friend's place, I had a couple drinks and for whatever reason, I felt incredibly drunk but no one else was and everyone else didn’t respond to me as if I was. No, instead everyone thought I was this incredibly charismatic person. I just couldn’t figure out why. Eventually, as other people started getting more drunk things started getting weirdly sexual everyone seemed to be super into me but for whatever reason, I kept leaving the party and whenever I did people kept asking me if I knew what a unicorn was.

 Confused I usually brushed them off which made them usually get angry or react in a strange way (One group of tradesmen rubbed their dirty rust water all over my neck)

My car was in park, but the engine kept reviving somehow. This made it kinda jiggle/jump around in its parking spot and start scratching the adjacent cars.

I was on top of the car trying to hold it down by holding the curb and pulling my weight down onto the car (idk man, dream logic). 

So I couldn’t text the girl back during our little argument, but I finally got the car back to normal and checked my phone and her last text was something like “we’re done” and I was super bummed.

Just thought that was f****** weird.. Any thoughts?

I (M27) have lived for 10 years in a foreign country studying and working away from my family, I am close to graduating from my master's degree and I have decided that once I finish my studies I will return to my country after my graduation. My mom and my sister are going to come to graduation ceremony and to spend a few days on vacation, I have been a bit stressed by having to deal with my graduation and the changes that involve returning to my city, where I lived until I was 17 years old.

 Now the dream goes as follows: My mom and my sister arrive in the city where I currently live and we were all three in a rented apartment, the apartment seems ok but it has defects in the color of the walls, strange sounds at night and in general has a strange ominous look, no running water, wierd spots on the walls and floor (that kind of thing).

 We went out to explore the city and spend the day on the beach but there is a huge violent demonstration throughout the city, the army is being deployed, there are fires, smoke and dead people in the streets.  

We then return to the apartment: this time the place seems in worse conditions than before, there is a lot of darkness, the objects begin to have a life of their own and my cat (who I found two years ago on the street and is white and fluffy in real life) becomes a huge, black and blue tiger then he tells me in a deep masculine voice that he is not a normal cat, he is ""a tiger with dry eyes"", while I approach to verify his eyes I realized that they are black with hair follicles, much like black whiskers instead of eyes. 

Then spiders of different sizes appear in the rooms of the apartment, they behave in a strange way and make threatening noises, they change shape and color, at this moment the dream is a full blown nightmare and I lose my sister and my mom.  I go back to the city to look for them, but the demonstration is now a major civil war, I see a soldier without a leg screaming in agony being carried on the outside of an ambulance because the ambulance is way overfilled with wounded soldiers, seeing this image I have to return to the apartment .  Upon returning I find three different characters, all of them are decorative objects of the apartment but they have become alive, as possessed, one of them is one of those decorative Russian dolls, she attacks me but I manage to break it with my hands, a blinding flash of light emerges of the branking doll.

And for some reason, I thought she's possessed or something really bad. I just remember that I have a feeling that there's a demon or just a bad presence in the dream. She doesnt go to school and has a lot of problems with family. But she's stil playing with her friends. She said it all started in the corner of her room. That there are black objects that constatly talking really bad about her. She talked about it with her mom and they put all the lights as much as they can. But it didn't do anything, it didn't leave her alone. So she just let those things happen. Then suddenly, I found myself in a cctv room in her house, thinking that I'm in my brother's POV(my own brother). I can see the little girl and a little boy having a conversation with no one around. All I can remember that they were talking about is the last part. The little girl said that she has a classmate that confessed his feelings to her and what she did was she fingered herself in front of him. Then the little boy ran away and can't be seen in the cctv camera anymore. Then me, looking in the screen, I saw the little girl looking around and then she fucking looked at the camera and my field of view shifted and all I can see is her and she sang so loud ""YOU'RE ALREADY TRACER YOU'RE ALREADY TRACER, YOU'RE ALREADY WIDOWMAKER YOU'RE ALREADY WIDOWMAKER"" I know it sounds silly but it scared me shitless in my dream, the lyrics on that fucking meme the way she sang was all ""You're"". I can't scream so moaned instead. Then I felt like she's holding both of my arms. I panicked and looked for the door, I managed to open it and saw another door in front of me. I opened it and saw my mom and I kinda hugged her. Then I woke up with my girlfriend beside me trying to wake me up. She said I was moaning so loud. I wasn't sweating or anything.

0.0,9yk76u,1.0,2.0,"So I just woke up and can remember the dreams I just had. 

I think the most interesting one is that I was in a lecture theatre for a drawing class I think? Drawing with led pencils and I was kind of stressed because we had a test coming up where the teacher would examine our pencil technique but my first two fingers were cramping up. It was so frustrating then I would try to ease my fingers back to their normal relaxed state but it didn’t work. Instead, my ring finger popped off. There wasn’t any blood it was just like smooth skin at the point of injury. That stressed me out even more. So I was talking to my teacher about the exam and trying to hide my injury so I wouldnt be disqualified from the exam. Then a couple moments later I watched it grow back to my normal sized, functioning finger. Somehow, I was telling myself in this dream that I have a good imagination since my finger that fell off was depicted in a surreal way (i.e it’s unrealistic to have had the finger not bleed or break a bone or something). I guess that’s all for that dream. 

Another dream was that I was in high school I assume (I graduated in 2016) and our class was going to get to interview One Direction and get their hot take on some big thing that happened (idk what it was). While we were all waiting, our teacher was checking on her kid through the window who was playing in the sandbox and there were all these little animals around. A kitten came to the window and I pat it but then it jumped so far down to the grass. Then for some reason I was running around this art museum and there was a huge room with these contemporary chinese artworks. There was a wooden and glass display cabinet with golf trim placed on its side and then all these paintings. When you entered this specific room you would just hear this calming music but I found it scary because no one was there so I ran back to where my class was (not supposed to run in art galleries). I basically then got to say to them “tbh I was never a big fan of 1D but now that you guys are solo artists it feels a lot more genuine like you’re not performing to perform you’re performing because you enjoy it”. Before I got to speak to them everyone kept talking over me, the same as I was trying to finish my statement but they were humbled by my opinion I think?

The next dream was that I sent the wrong text accidentally to my grandma that was full of profanities. She lectured me forever about my terrible behaviour. (My grandma is filipino and our family is very strict christian).

The last two dreams were the first and the last dreams of the night but they are really similar. In the first one I met Bruno Mars who is my first ever favourite musician. He was minding his friends little barber shop but also doing Meet & Greets but there was like no one there? So I got to talk to him about everything I appreciated about his music and how I listened to it during the most foundational years of my life (high school). The next dream I met Anderson .Paak and he was really flirty and was like acting all cool and slick and then the bartender told me to check my instagram following (I just posted on ig last night for the first time in weeks). Although the amount of followers I gained wasn’t that much. It was still like 200+ so I assumed it was Paaks crew and stuff who like pick out potential girls and stuff. Then someone who was with Paak mentioned how [one of my friends] has big tits and that now she’s accepting all these followers (she has a very private account irl). 

For context I’m a female studying Graphic Design & Digital Media at university and I have always made art my whole life. I usually have anxiety dreams but none of these gave me that same feeling which is good. I hope someone could give me some interesting interpretation of any one of these? Especially the finger dream because that one was super bizarre. I’m trying to work through the meaning of that one too. Thank you !

At one point in the dream I took on the persona of an old bus driver with an incredible white mustache. For some reason the bus was in a hurry to go somewhere, and I knew everyone on board was going to the same destination. We weren’t driving on a road, we were driving on some sort of concrete river outlet (it looked a lot like the LA river) going uphill. We were going fast but there was a pile of junk on our side of the river and we had to jump to the other side to make it safely. I drove the bus off one side and landed successfully on the other, but on landing there was a loud yelp from a man in the bus.

The bus stopped and we got out to see the man was panicking, couldn’t breathe and couldn’t speak. He laid against the concrete bank and I started pressing under his rib age assuming something had shifted in his body from the impact. After a moment I felt a clearage of air in my own body (kind of like a burp coming up but more intense) and he gasped for air after being nearly unconscious.

My girlfriend recently left me for another man (both of whom are in this dream).  This man in my dream was referred to as “him” and she is referred to “her”.   Together referred to as “They”. I have a very close relationship with my now ex-girlfriend’s dad, Tim.  His ex-wife’s name is veronica.  I did not and do not share the same closeness with her.  My ex-girlfriends’ new boyfriend has a brother.  They live together from my understanding.  I have never met either one of them, but while I was still seeing my ex (and after she had already slept with this guy and told me about it) we had seen them (the two brothers) at the bar that she works at while getting dinner.  I don’t go there anymore for obvious reasons, but I have been harboring an underlying embarrassment as many of the people that work there were my friends and knew about my girlfriend's infidelities and never told me about them.  Not to mention our break up was really ugly.  So here we go…

The dream began with a display of the scene.  This strangely designed house, viewed from the outside, appears to be log cabin-esque.  It was evening it looks just like it does right now outside, gray, snowy and cold.  Then it falls into view from my perspective.  I know that I’m at “His” house.  I know that “He” is not there yet.  I know that Tim is there.  I’m in a bathroom.  My teeth hurt.  Tim calls a doctor to the house to have my teeth worked on.  I spill pain medication and now I can’t find it.  I’m on my hands and knees looking for it.  Now “They” are home.  “He” doesn’t care that I’m there.  It’s his birthday.  He speaks as to not make any sense at all, but with a great amount of authority almost angrily.  “She” says nothing but follows him and listens with obedience looking scared and unhappy.  She appears shackled almost being directed into his room as he walks in front of her.  I can hear them having sex from behind the closed door.  I’m in an upstairs hallway, in front of me is a railing that overlooks a large opening and a stair case down to the first floor.  It’s his birthday.  Now I’m in the garage looking for medicine on the ground.  I can hear them talking about me, though it makes no sense.  Tim is talking to veronica on the phone and is worried about my condition.  “His” brother also makes no sense and is angry, but I never see him.  He sort of talks to me, but not really.  I’m in the bathroom, “He” is there too.  Angry.  Talking to me but also not talking to me.  I’m down stairs again.  There is a door cut in half as to make a top half of the door and a bottom half.  I struggle to try to operate this door.  I can feel “She” is unhappy and scared.  Tim is concerned for me.  “He” goes back to having sex with her in the same loud, angry way as before.  “His” brother just wanders around mumbling angrily.",hot,"A Dream While Napping: Hurting Teeth, Angry People, Birthdays and More",1.0

Me and Francessca went into a tower at night and talked. Then I met with Dr Jones and he told me I had to accept the fact that my life was over.

It takes place in the town close to a college campus of which i don't recognize being awake but in the dream i do know it. It's really weird because the campus had been in a dream previously but not in the town.  I was walking with what in the dream was my close friend(Once again don't know this guy IRL but somehow in the dream i just knew) when we were jumped by 3 guys.

&#x200B;

This is where shit gets complicated. It was almost like someone else joined me and my friends group as soon as we got jumped, i didn't get to see him but i sensed his presence and it was someone i knew just not as well. All three of us getting robbed knew the robbers and they knew us too. One of the 3 robbers who pointed a gun at me had a sense of melancholy and sadness as if he didn't want to do this but had no choice. After sensing this for some reason i asked if he could just go ahead and take my (dream me apparently drops F bombs too) wallet to which he said yeah and took it out of my back pocket.

&#x200B;

One of the 3 guys in my group was not as lucky, the guy robbing him was easily distracted and an angry person. It was weird because i could feel the attributes in this guy like being quick to anger, easily distracted a natural leader by using force. If you gave him a square and a round hole he'd make it work. He seemed different than the guy robbing me. The guy robbing me was patient, kind, sensitive albeit a wussy and a natural follower.

Finally, the scene changes and i am on top of a tower with the angry guy from earlier and he is bloodied and beaten. I finally throw him off the top after a moment of wrestling. I look over the edge to down below and its the same area i was being robbed but the street had been replaced with a river which was as wide across as a highway. Four or five other bodies were already in it laying still as if they were waiting. When the body finally hits the river flows forwards and oddly enough i jump in.

0.0,9xnzy7,1.0,1.0,"I don't know how much information is required to make the least amount of effort of a conjecture, so let me introduce myself: I was 16 years old when I dreamed this. I'm a male. I'm bisexual. 
It's been several months since I had this dream. It's resurfaced on my mind recently. 
In it, I was another man. I was a man whose works I like. I was Hideo Kojima, a game developer. Our personalities are a tid-bit alike, but I don't really idolize the guy. 

It was night. I was searching for places that the plot of my (Hideo's) next game could base itself on, with my crew. One of my stops was this snowy, mountain-esque region that housed a gargantuan-sized hotel.

Its foundations were made of wood, its lighting was this powerful amber-like yellow hue. The hotel also had this waterfall by its side.
I'm not sure if this dream came to me at the same time that I was watching 'Twin Peaks', but I can definitely say that its aesthetic was very much akin to that of the Great Northern Hotel. The only difference was that my hotel expanded drastically on a vertical axis because of its mountainous setup. 
While climbing snowy steps --towards the hotel-- that resembled the architecture of asian monastic temples, I get a message on my phone. 
It's the girl. 
I'm not quite sure what she messaged me, but at least I remember her profile picture with half-assed accuracy: It shows her scarred arm, cut multiple times by acts of self-harm. I remember feeling guilty, since she was going down a dark path and I was doing nothing to stop her.

Next thing I remember, I'm with her. We're at the extension of the hotel's lounge, which is a veranda that sits in reasonably big heights above the ground. She takes one of her gloves off, I take mine. To substitute the fabric's function of warmth, we clasp our hands together in a romantic manner. 
She says that she'll always be with me. She jumps off the parapet. I look down desperately, surprised, horrified, as she falls. 

Dream ends. 
I wake up... not feeling horrified, feeling warm inside. Feeling loved.


**Some notes that I think to be of importance:**
When I had this dream, I was just recovering from a period of massive depression that had haunted me for a year and a half. I was on medication, I had suicidal ideations...

In the dream I went over to a friend's house with another friend. The three of us were sitting on the floor around a small coffee table when the friend whose house we were in says we have to perform some sort of ritual. 

Everyone present had to partake in the ritual once it was started. I felt really trapped. The ritual involved looking at a wall clock, then a loud gong sound rang, and you had to read the different numbers that flashed on the clock until another gong sound came, then it was the next person's turn. Each of the three of us had to keep taking turns doing this until some dinosaur looking demon would appear and roar at us, and then we could stop. I also kept crying and asking my friends what the purpose of the ritual was and they refused to tell me.

At some point my parents came to pick me up and begged me to leave the house, but I cried and told them I couldn't stop or leave until the ritual was over.

Eventually the dinosaur looking demon roared and I left with my parents.

In the next part of the dream I was doing some hardcore praying because I was scared that taking part in that ritual would mean demons would come after me, and then I started praying wherever I went due to fear. 

In the next part of the dream, my ex girlfriend and I were in this old house with some of our friends when she asked me to go outside with her because she had to talk to someone. We crossed this super dark garden and I prayed again, when we peeked inside of the small garden cottage and saw two witches inside. We then ran back inside the old house. My teacher, who was dressed like a priest, then saw a demon outside of the window and he fainted. I brought him inside a room to take care of him, and he woke up and asked me why he saw a demon. I told him about the ritual and then he fainted again. Then I woke up.

first of all a bit about me:

Im 17 years old, i'm white ,i'm a boy, I would say my personality is (according to an online  Myers–Briggs Type Indicator ) is the mediator. Currently finish my last year of school

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Im doing this because i would like there to be record of the dream and because this one confused the living hell out of me

&#x200B;

So i guess i should start with the setting. The place was a dark coastal city embedded in the cliffs, it wasn't dark like night it was just kinda gloomy the people the resided there were these weird gecko/chameleon (mainly the face, the face was the eyes of a chameleon and a lot of the rest was more gecko) and their bodies were slim and much more thin looking than they should be ( i have no idea how big they were as there was nothing human to compare them to) and they lived in this city. 

&#x200B;

There were 2 duck people (Think Duck tales)  (they seemed to have a Sherlock Holmes and Watson type of bond) and they were there because of a business trip? I'm not actually too sure but i believe it was formal and they had discussion with 2 of the lizard people inside a big stone building at a desk, i cant remember exactly what had happened but it was a long discussion. 

&#x200B;

This is the part im most focused on.

So there was this one lizard person (same person inside the building with the duck people) (lets call this lizard person Jeremy for now) and he was walking by with the ducks and while walking they see a visual representation of an elf/human   woman but she had big eyes that were completely dark and greyish skin and weird scale-like stuff on her body which was because she seemed like she had drowned and its revealed that she used to be a lover to Jeremy but she had died and now there was this creature in the dock that i believe is now what happened to the woman.

&#x200B;

A while later (by that i mean i can't remember anything between that point and this point) we finally see her/it she looks normal except for the stuff detailed in her description above and she taunts and tries to lure Jeremy and a Duck Person off the dock which doesn't work. Later Jeremy is on his own and catches her in a magical sack and tries to take her back somewhere while she is talking to him trying to convince him to open the sack and let her out (crocodile tears and all that) however he doesn't budge. 

&#x200B;

(This is the part i remember the most as it repeated multiple times) 

He got trapped in the sack with her or she escaped and dragged him to the ocean but either way he is stuck with her/it. and thats where we see her true form under the water that she hides. a mass of these weird vine like tentacles with red sharp spikey things at the end and just tonnes of green (fair warning the next bit is kinda graphic and involves murder) she completely encases them both in her vine/tentacles (like a cocoon) and she begins to wrap him in the vines just stabbing at him and laughing and ripping him until she opens up a part of him to reveal his heart which she pierces with multiple vines/tentacles and rips out and eats it?(not too sure but she does something with it) while this is happening there is alot of heart imagery being presented e.g. where the heart was now a the vines red things are stuck together like a heart and the water around them in the cocoon is like a glowing pinkish/reddish colour

if anyone has any more details they would like i could try and remember but i can't remember much.

In the first dream, I am given a pair of yellow pet birds. They are a couple. They love each other. I put them on a stick in my bedroom closet (doors open) in lieu of a cage. They are free to fly out whenever. They appear on my bed and I am afraid of crushing them, but they are fine. However, when I wake up the next morning, they are gone. I tell my mom that they are dead. She said she knows, and she shows gives me the dead birds. I feel grief. She explains that the birds need to be fed sugar to stay alive, that this is a common mistake to only feed them bird food. 

In the second dream, my mom gives me a dog/fox. I bring the dog to the barn where nobody can see it. While I am there, I see two rats scurrying on the ground. I want them dead. I immediately step on them, and easily kill them. While upset for my actions, I kick the dog. The kick leaves a gory injury to the stomach, and the dog dies. I leave the barn and go outside. Throughout the rest of the dream, I am focusing on hiding what I did from my extended family. I feel intense shame and guilt for killing a dog. 

What significance do the birds have? The rats? The dog-fox-thing? I feel really bad about having these dreams. I love animals wholeheartedly. I know they are probably representative of something else. Could it be representative of me hiding my sexual identity (bi)? I am in a heterosexual relationship with my boyfriend, and he is comfortable with my sexuality. Also, I watched a show about fundamental mormons yesterday. Polygamy was a main theme. Were these dreams in any way connected to that? Also I have been struggling a lot with figuring out who I am throughout the past 3 years.

When I dream, when I do things they tend to not work, but even if they don't everyone just pretends like it actually happened.

For example, let's say I want to shoot someone with a finger gun. I shoot them, but nothing happens. No bullets come out, there are no holes in the person, it's just like real life. But the person I shot may still act like they have just been shot, and fall to the ground dead.


Another example, let's say I'm fighting a monster. There is no monster, it's just empty space. So I fight the air and 'pretend' like there's a monster there, and everyone else believes it. Its almost as if you take a real scene with a monster terrorizing people, and just simple cropped out the actual monster. Like my brain doesn't create the visual model for it.


Whether it's my own actions or objects in the environment, my dreams wont create these things, but me and everyone else plays pretend like it still happened. The feeling I have in my dream when this happens though is similar to when you might try to start a lawnmower as a kid infront of your family, but it just refuses to start.

So, I actually created a Reddit profile to be able to get some feedback about this dream I literally *just* woke up from, and have had in the past.  (Or, more accurately, have had variations of in the past.)

It usually starts with a party, where my ""closest friends"" and I are in attendance.  I say ""closest friends"" because maybe 1-3 of my actual close friends of >15 years are actually there, but the rest are people I don't recognize (from my real life) but do have feelings of closeness towards.  Anyhow, it starts when - for reasons I don't remember - I start transforming people into grotesque, zombie like monsters when I touch them.  There's usually a delay, but I know what's coming, and so the person is confused about why I'm acting weirdly towards them until they turn into a monster zombie with a grotesquely large grin.  Eventually everyone turns into a zombie and I'm eaten alive.  Except I don't feel it, because the day starts over again. 

There will be different versions of this, with disasters that reach critical mass until I'm killed or jump out of a window, etc.  I can't really remember but it feels like I'm the cause of whatever happened, but also that it was inevitable?

Towards the very end of the dream, I kind of knew I was dreaming.  I remember someone goes ""Isn't that your best friend \[insert name\]?""  Now, this person was my best friend during college, and we still have a close relationship, but she's not my closest friend at the moment.  She was also in the car with me in the dream at this point.  (We were all cognizant of the Groundhogs Day nature of our existences at this point.)

Hi I'm 22, Female, White(Scottish) 

Last night I had the most disturbing dream I've had in a long while. Bodyhorror warning.

I dreamt I was hanging out with my friend when something happened. I don't know how to describe it, I poked a growth on my shoulder and suddenly my right hand had no skin and I could see my finger bones move and it only hurt when I moved my hand. I went to seek help, and, on the way, my left hand had developed a growth similar to the one on my shoulder which I pawed at with my wrecked right hand, a weird 6 legged half formed creature fell out of the growth. This repeated while I went looking for a hospital until I woke up. 

a few relevant things in my life that could have contributed to this is that I recently moved got a new job and had a death in my family all within about 2 months. That day had also been quite stressful, I don't want to say why as it's an ongoing issue. I don't plan on having kids, so I don't understand why a weird unhuman foetus fell out of my handwomb. And no, body horror does not get me off. ",hot,What does it mean if you dream that your right hand is damaged and your left hand is giving birth?,6.0

I remember running around desperately looking for a hiding spot until some little girl came and gave my hiding place away. Then my sister told me I might have to climb out of the window which was a few stories high. I didn’t. I went around to a different room which was closer to ground level and saw a window open. Then a car drove by and saw me so I had to hide. I remembered there were katanas in the room so me and my sister got the katanas when the cats walked around the corner. I stabbed mine pretty deep and then kind of was able to stab the stray. Then we locked ourselves behind another door and waited. I looked through the crack in the door and saw the two cats were fine! They were just sitting there cleaning themselves. 
I’d also like to mention that the night before this I had a dream that my cat (same one mentioned above) was hit by a car. I picked him up off the road and he became fine and alive.

Dream: 

My boyfriend and I are on a school bus. He's talking and I'm feeling annoyed, emotionally shutting down. The bus drops us off at my high school stop and we start walking toward my childhood home. I'm looking down, walking with my arms crossed to avoid him. He asks what's wrong and when I explain I was triggered by something he said, he gets upset and runs off ahead. 

I'm about to chase him but I see he's stopped in fear. Sitting beneath a tree is a huge black tiger (I say tiger rather than panther to emphasize size and shape.) It's face is like a robotic interpretation of a tiger, a dark reflective metal. 

I slowly walk across the street. I want to turn and call out to my boyfriend, but I don't want to startle the tiger. 

He starts tiptoeing backward slowly. 

I want to pull out my phone and call 9-1-1 but don't want to startle the tiger with any sudden movements. My boyfriend is halfway across the street, about where I was standing when I spotted the tiger, when a large boy goes to the tiger and starts teasing it with a stick. 

Rather than being scared, everyone is in shock that this guy is poking the tiger. I'm too afraid to yell to him to stop, because I don't want to startle the tiger. The tiger attacks him, tearing  his arm. 

I turn and call 9-1-1.

Symbols: Skeleton/ bones in a field, a bird race, grandmother’s home, vagrants, antique buddhist structures, dark alley 

Dream: 

I'm in an open field, collecting the bones an old skeleton of what may be a ruminant animal. I specifically remember finding the parts of the tailbone.  

(Last night I watched [an episode of Adventure Time](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Daddy-Daughter_Card_Wars) where Jake the dog gives one of his bones to his daughter in exchange for her to play in a boardgames tournament with him). 

I’m now watching or following a group of vagrants who are wandering around and setting up camp in a new place every night. I follow them to a wide, dark alley in a mixed-use area of town. They have found a space against the building to set up camp and have pulled various objects from nearby, including the alley, into their makeshift camp. I could see that they had set up some patio string lights and chairs. When I was there, they were already gone. I searched the alley, now concerned that the vagrants may have taken something of mine. These were old things, barely any sentimentality left. I mainly remember the antique Buddhist statues and other miscellaneous treasures like that. Mostly small things I’d nearly forgotten about. I briefly felt anxiety about dusting everything off and attending to all those memories when the dream shifts. 

I’m in my grandmother’s front yard, and her street has become a kind of personal archetype for me in that it is the prototypical symbol of home, childhood, safety, being carefree.  

On the street I see more vagrants, now they have coerced a bunch of various birds (I remember pigeons, chickens, probably one more) to gather. They then have the birds race down the street, and for some reason the birds are struggling to even glide. They appear to be frantic but willing to race. Many drop eggs and these splatter on the road in a gross and humorous way. The vagrants are hollering and having a great time.  

This is all I can remember, and I wake up.  ",hot,"Skeleton/ bones in a field, a bird race, grandmother’s home, vagrants, antique buddhist structures, dark alley",2.0

The elevator came to a stop finally,  the back of the room opened up and there was Hell as I sort of expected.  I saw a demonic judge with a thing in one hand with saws and drills and grinders and stuff and in the other with what looked like a giant taser electrical thing.

Guilty and you get that saw buzz thing, it quickly ground the person to nothing with the blades moving that fast with only a splash of blood at the bottom, and the person was gone into a gutter.  No one answered innocent.

Than I began to notice the  Aurora borealis in my sky, I though that it was odd due to me living in Louisiana, so I ran inside to grab my wife. And as we went back outside. It was daytime. And all the clouds in the sky started glitching. They changed colors and shapes, than all of a sudden the clouds turned into raw code.

So just for context, Mumi was born in 2002 in my bathroom, I was 2 years old so that's why his name was Mumi. Mumi was a diva, but a sweet diva. He demanded attention by anyone near him. He was a bit greedy but a really good cat who could sense when something was wrong, my mother and I are for example both mentally unstable and he seemed much more gentle and affectionate on bad days. He was just a very typical sassy tabby.

In September or so, we had to put him down. He was 16, his liver was shutting down and he was building up fluid in his stomach. My mom went to the vet with him on a Friday morning, I knew she was gonna go to the vet some day in that week but because of absence at school I didn't want to know when, so I didn't get to say a proper goodbye. We buried him underneath our large fir tree, and I was probably the one who cried the most. Whenever I have the time, I decorate his grave with sticks, pebbles and flowers and talk to him, I miss him terribly. 

About a month ago we adopted a kitten named Puddle who behaves just like Mumi did and we all adore him. Besides Puddle we also have Ariel and her grown kitten Fatty. We also have our dog Yoyo, we got him almost 3 years ago so Mumi knew him and loved him. We also had a big red tabby main coon mix named Red, he and Mumi were inseparable so when Mumi died, Red stopped eating, he disappeared around 14 days after Mumi died, he showed obvious signs of depression. 

Now, last night I had a nightmare. I dreamt that I came home from school. It was very dark so all I could see was the lights in the windows of my house. As I opened the door, I noticed a small shadow by my feet. For some reason I knew it was Mumi. Mumi ran into the house and I didn't think of it more. The energy in the house had changed however, it was cold and numb, almost standing still. The lights would flicker, cabinets and doors would open wide and shut violently, we could all hear whispers. The cat in the house was Mumi but he wasn't Mumi. I remember trying to pet him but he would fade away as soon as I touched him, and reappear somewhere else. We have this short hallway that leads to the dining room and living room where he was suddenly standing. The lights went off in the hallway and all I could see was two glowing yellow eyes and it was as if Mumi started growing rapidly. I could feel the evil energy from him. That's all I can remember before I woke up. It all felt way too real, and I had to make sure he was still in his grave this morning, and I felt like I was being watched all the way from the driveway to the sidewalk and to the bus. 

Mumi was not evil at all. He was the sweetest and sassiest cat I've ever had. Google doesn't give me an answer, so I'm asking people here, what could this mean?

If this is useful information that can help, I will tell you some personal details: I'm 18, I'm a trans guy, my zodiac is cancer, rising sagittarius, I'm infp, agnostic (lightly pantheist), and I believe in the paranormal and supernatural.  I occasionally have nightmares about demon animals, the most recent I can recall is one where I'm chased through the forest by shadow like deer. They eventually kill me. I figured it meant I was desperately running from everything feminine about myself, which is true. However I have never dreamt that my loved ones, both animals and humans, were evil and/or demonic.

Relevant goings on: Parents are getting divorced, I only recently started seeing a therapist who specializes in transgender youth, joined four different extracurriculars.

When I say X, I mean he said first name, and the last half of their previous surname.** (Their parents {I assume} recently got a divorce and they're now going by their mom's last name, however the boy said the last half of their dad's last name {which they used to go by})  **X is definitely not the suicidal type, they've always seemed cheery and in a good mood to me, certainly not anything close wanting to end life.**

**I would say I'm somewhere between asexual and pansexual.** (Sexuality has never seemed understandable or important or anything to me) **Although if there was ever anybody I would say I am 'attracted to,' it would be X.**

**X was assigned female at birth, and that's how all the people at school know them, although if you hadn't noticed, I've been referring to them as ""they,"" because I myself am a trans person, and suspect them to be somewhere along the 'not cisgender' spectrum as well, or at the very questioning. It's likely wrong for me to assume a thing like this, although:** (Now keep in mind, I am IN NO WAY saying that gender identity in anyway must relate to gender identity, however, I still have my suspicions.)

**1: They chopped off all their hair, having it shorter than most boys**

**2: They present in an androgynous** (gender neutral) **style.

**3: They did each of the three 'main' projects at our school in relation to gender.** (*How gender stereotypes negatively affect the school environment, the history of transgender rights,* and *3 transgender musicians* were basically the names of their projects) 

**4: They go by a more gender neutral nick name rather than their fairly feminine birth name**

**After the class heard the news that the boy brought them, he sat back down and my head was sent reeling. At the time, I thought what was happening in the dream was real** (as happens in all my dreams) **and I cried. My entire class was sobbing. My teacher stated how 'truly unfortunate' this was.** (Thinking back on it, I realize there are about 5 kids in my Language Arts class who likely wouldn't cry at the news, and I realize now, either they were crying, or they weren't there at all.)

By the way, when I say X, that's not their actual name, to be clear.

For context, I'm a Caucasian 18-year-old male, and I tend to deprive myself of sleep quite often. I draw a lot, so I spend hours up every night to work on my art. Sometimes, I fall asleep at the table I'm sitting at, and during these times, I usually spread myself out over two seats.

During one of these table-rests, I had a dream of somebody that I have called ""Sammy"". The reason why is because when I saw him in my dream, the name ""Sammy"" kept on lingering in my head, even when I woke up. I don't know anybody in my life called Sammy, though I did have a neighbour called Sammy that recently passed, but these two people look and act nothing alike.

The Sammy in my dream was a Caucasian male, who appeared to be in his mid-twenties. He was wearing a sky-blue hoodie with the hood up, but I can't recall what he was wearing below the waist. I do know that he had a big white ""S"" on the front of his hoodie, which I presume stood for ""Sammy"". He had messy blonde hair that poked out from underneath his hood, and a really big smile. Not creepy or anything, just a big smile.

He also had what I can only describe as ""feminine eyes"".

This is a really weird way of describing it, but it's true. His eyelashes were very long and dramatic, and he had icy-blue eyes that looked like contact lenses. It's super weird.
I'm a gay man, if that has any bearing on this, but I've never worn makeup or anything to influence this.

In the dream, Sammy was mute, but he did follow me out of my house. I remember crossing the road, but he emerged from my neighbour's bushes and silently followed me at a brisk pace. In the dream, I felt really scared of him for some reason, but even in my dream, I couldn't even scream. I could just half-walk, half-drag myself across the road, too afraid to turn my back on him.

I don't know what Sammy did when he caught up with me, because I don't remember what happened afterwards. I don't know if I woke up right afterwards, or if the dream went on further and I blocked out what happened afterwards.

there’s a backstory about this person i need to explain before i get to the dream part 

me and this person had a rocky relationship 1-2 years ago and we were not nice to each other at all. i’m not sure why we were so mean but we were really young and immature. this was during school, so after summer break i apologized to him. he was sorry too. he tried talking to me a couple of times but i give off a very strong “i don’t like you” vibe to people naturally, so that may have pushed him away (but in reality i don’t know why he stopped), he was nice and friendly those times. after that we did not talk, but i became obsessed with him. there was no reason for this. we were not friends and the bad times outnumbered the good by a huge amount. i sought him out constantly that school year and he showed absolutely no interest back. it’s been over a year since that initial obsession and it’s died down quite a lot but only within the past month or so (so i’ve been having these feelings for over a year). i still have not talked to him and he still doesn’t really pay attention to me

back in march the obsession was still strong. i had a dream that involved him being violently kidnapped from my apartment through my window (i wasn’t in the room, and when i ran in it was too late)

the dream a month ago was me, my friend and him. we are all in the same physics class in real life, and said friend is the only person i really know in there so i talk to her a lot (and he would be able to see and hear these conversations). i was talking to my friend normally in the dream while we were outside surrounded by lots of other people, and me and him just awkwardly looked at each other from time to time. all three of us were in really close proximity to each other though, which isn’t how it is in real life.

the most recent dream happened when i actually felt over him entirely. i did not want to think of him. i was not interested in talking to him at all because after so long i was ready to let go. i felt annoyed when i thought of him. however, i had a dream we were in a classroom with computers and he was being friendly with me. he was smiling and talking. even after i got up and left he was looking at me from time to time. after this dream my progress was pushed back a bit and now i think about him a little more. but let me repeat. i don’t know why i’m thinking of him so much in the first place... we were never friends. we had a couple of good times before but compared to the amounts of conflict we had, i feel like that was almost nothing in comparison 

i don’t know how he actually feels about me in real life. it seems like he doesn’t like me from how i described him but it’s... hard to tell. this post is already long enough though so thoughts, insight, etc are appreciated ",hot,person keeps showing up in my dream,1.0

The earliest dream I ever had related to this was some kind of gas killed every human being, and we reached some other place (presumably heaven). This morning I had a dream that I had about a year ago, infact I made this account to post about this dream I had. It was the same, exact, 100% carbon copy dream I had a while ago. It begins with me fighting a guy who has a button which activates the missile, which is hidden in a cupcake. I some-how took that cupcake,  and that guy said ""I don't care, it's your problem"". I took the missile and ran off to the street. That street was my childhood street. While I  was running I met my neighbour (she passed 4 years ago), she was a very lovable person. I run ahead and saw a tiger approaching me. I took the cupcake and threw it to make it go away (note that I wasn't aware if the button shoots a missile towards us, or we launch some missile.) I run towards my house again and outside my house I meet a very cute dog, I patted him, while I was patting him, I saw the missile in the sky, it was amazing, the missile came to me and crashed, didn't explode.

I dreamed I was in a group of friends and family talking to some mad hatter guy. His clothes/ costume were green and white. He invited us into his weird house to give us a tour. 

He was giving everyone readings. It came my turn. Everyone shuffled off. When I stepped up to get my reading i felt incredibly uneasy and suddenly felt a hand slide down my back. 

I turned and it was a strange creepy person perched on a ledge behind me. I cried out and said ""Don't touch me."" I tried to explain to the Mad Hatter some guy just touched me and it threw me off, but he just grabbed my hands and started moving some weird purpleish blue thing over the palms. 

My hands were trembling. He finished scanning my palms and started mumbling or whispering to himself and moving the hands (backwards) on a toy or cardboard cartoon- looking clock with red, pointy fancy arrows/hands. 

This is where it got terrifyingly dark. Suddenly a hook on a metal stick coming out from the clock or wall area grabbed me by the bra/shirt, and the Hatter' s face warped like Bilbo Baggins in LoTR in that scene with Frodo in Rivendell, but more terrifying. 

I got yanked in, the Hatter grabbed me and in a terrifying hissing voice holding me on my knees by my kneck started violently conveying I had ""2 seconds to live"" and he was about to kill me. I closed my eyes and braced for actual death. That's when I had a false waking, and (still dreaming) started processing and researching and recording that nightmare.

A minute or so later, I woke up in real life. It was SO, SO VIVID.

I'm a 24 year old male, INFP, caucasion, and the night I had this dream I had an argument with my close friend about some goings on in her life that she won't share; I'd been having trouble with trusting that she is still my friend and that we're not having a full on falling out fight. I think that's all relevant information. I changed my friend's name, obviously.

It follows two different places, in the same world, which was a vast, mostly ocean, archipelago.

At night. On a southern island, an outpost. A war is on. It's lightly raining. A man is trying to figure out where the enemy is, and can't get it. They're in the water, beneath the surface, spying with a small robotic insect. But then alarms go off, the man looks up, knows what it means. Far away, almost at the horizon, he sees the lights of the city, and lightning, and in the light a massive silhouette of a monster. Like twice godzillas size, swinging at the city. The man knows its over, knows that there are more kaiju all around the archipelago, and goes to his base, pours some whiskey, and presses the button. And the nukes detonate, destroying the world.

Hours or days earlier, it's daylight, I'm at the head of an army, facing hordes of evil things, wolves, orcs, trolls.... We have to break through, the leader is at the top of the mountain, we have to kill him. We charge. I fight forever, there's no reprieve, no reinforcements.

We get slaughtered, but at the last, the navy arrives and gives artillery support as i and the few survivors make a mad charge up to the citadel at the top of the mountain.

We make it by nightfall, but all we find is a corpse. I walk out to the peak. Below, and far distant, but everywhere, are monsters, kaiju, all unfathomably huge, destroying all in their path, cities are falling, the navy is trying to attack but can't make a dent. I hear, distantly, the alarms, the screams of the dying. I know what comes next. I see the flash of light in the distance, the mushroom clouds that dwarf even the mountain.

I run. I have one thought, i have to get to Annie, have to protect her and tell her I love her, I'm sorry I couldn't win, I'm sorry the world is ending.

I find her, I see the wave of nuclear explosion racing toward us and tackle her, try to shield her with my body, whisper in her ear, and feel her anger, and then we're all gone",hot,"Had a dream that's been weighing on me all week, would love some thoughts",2.0

This dream contains **two** layers

&#x200B;

# Layer 1-1

I was hanging out with friends in a cafe(?), the place we were at is dark and nothing have really happened there

&#x200B;

# Layer 1-2

I teamed up with my friends to fight another teams in a competition.

We were required to pick our own weapons, I had my hands on a couple of (chrome plated) swords, but they are not very handy.

I didnt see what weapon did my teammates have, and who my opponents were.

In the end I chose a bar shaped weapon with a sharpened end. Then we entered our first fight, we won in the end but I dont recall what have happened.

This part of the dream stopped after the first fight.

&#x200B;

# Layer 2

In layer 2, I woke up from layer 1. There is a laptop in front of me, and apparently my dream has been uploaded onto the computer.

**While in layer2, I knew clearly that Layer 1 is a dream. But I didnt know I was still in my dream.**

My uploaded dreams are in an excel sheet.

It contains accurate written description of each event in Layer 1-1 and a short video with each piece of descriptions.

The text description made sense when I was reading them in the dream, in fact they are quite well written. But I couldnt recall anything about it after woke up.

&#x200B;

**Everything ends here, I didnt read the whole file so I dont know if Layer 1-2 is recorded in that file**

0.0,9vmvjy,16.0,2.0,"To start off, in the past I've had a few dreams about catastrophic world events that unfolded the next day in reality. These happened when I was a kid, though. I'm an adult, 30yo female. Christian, with an open mind and I believe American Christianity glosses over and ignores a lot of more spiritual processes and events. I think science and spirituality coincide and are connected much more than we currently know.

The recurring dreams all have in common that I'm somewhere with my family (husband and 2 young children) and a dark smoky mass that I instinctively know is evil and demonic appears in the top corner of a room we're in. 

My first and only reaction is absolute rage and anger that this entity dare be here. I begin screaming at it and giving it a verbal lashing for daring to be anywhere near me. Along the lines of, ""How dare you be here! By the Almighty God who is above all, LEAVE! Get out! Get the fuck out! Get out of my space!"" 

The demon never really fights back. It just kinda slinks away, with a mildly threatening air still around it.

On occasion, I've had this dream where after the entity leaves, a large black panther appears and stares deep into my eyes. I try to swat it away, annoyed and angry with it for being there, but I can't make physical contact with it and it eventually leaves on it's own. When I have that rendition of the dream, someone I know dies unexpectedly within a few days. 

Ive tried looking up interpretations of this, but demonic dreams seem to center around paralyzing fear and terror. My dreams all center around me being so indignant and full of rage that this thing dare be in my space, around my family and my children, that I can't be scared. I know for a fact if this happened in real life, I'd be a terrified mess. But in my dreams, though I'm mildly scared and feel threatened, I'm more angrily determined to get it away.

I'll try to recite as much of this dream as I can, but dreams being dreams, I won't have all of the information.

I was walking around the street near my college campus when two guys jump out of a van and started trying to wrestle me into it. I'm a pretty tall guy - 6'10, 220 to be specific, though for some reason I couldn't fight them off for the life of me. Anyway, they took me this basement and began feminizing me - put me in a pink night dress, ran me through a machine to make my figure more slender (though I forgot if they shrunk me), dolled me up with makeup - basically the entire process of turning a normal dude into a supermodel.

Then, I was escorted to this podium where I was ""bid"" on like an auction as the auctioneer began describing what they did with me and my ""qualities"". They basically talked about how I was perfect slave material and would make anyone who bought me happy. I ended up being sold to someone who I only realized was my RL girlfriend when we got home.

I start at the bottom, to my left is a small girl with blond hair, wearing a pink and white polka dot dress, she is staring at a portrait of herself hanging on the wall. Its old and damaged, like its been through a fire or mishandled by its owner. She is mirroring her portrait perfectly and doesn't respond to anything I say or do. I move to the second level of the room and there is a closed window to my right that over looks a city at night, connected by bridges. I see a reflection of myself in the window and I always look my current age. I move onto the 3rd level of the room and in front of me there is a stone pedestal with a glowing orb on it. It shines in a rainbow of colors but it isn't to bright. A cloaked man emerges from the left corner of the room, his skin is pale and his cloak hides everything but his face. The cloaked man smiles at me and motions towards the orb, before I can reach for it the window on the second level opens up and a cool autumn breeze floods the room. I move back down to the window and gaze out at the city, despite being lit up at night it is completely silent. After gazing out into it I wake up.

I started burning the spiderwebs from the forest floor with some sort of torch and with rage, hearing the raven voice in my head ""I know everything you do"", ""Don't bother"". I stopped.

Went back to the house, looking how I was stepping on the spiderwebs, everyone was nattered around the raven who was sickly seems in a cocoon of spiderwebs, dying slowly, I panicked and didn't want to die.

I was trying desperately to talk to it but didn't answer back, everyone was watching, not a word was spelled out or thought. They were looking at me or at the ground. I was looking at everyone looking for an answer.

The next thing i know, my ex boyfriend and some of our mutual friends are shaking me awake as im laying on a couch alone. They each start handing me different bills i owed and photos and letters, and tell me i was missing for two years and these are things i never received due to that. I also remember my ex telling me how good i looked. They were each hugging me and stuff, and telling me that they never gave up searching and then suddenly I'm in the car with my dad and he's driving me home. Wherever we were appeared to be extremely far from home, because we were driving on an icy mountainside road, and i'm from texas. Me and my dad's conversation didnt really go anywhere and we barely talked about what happened, but i was scrolling through social media and seriously freaking the fuck out in the backseat. I remember the intense ass feeling of seeing how everyone's lives had moved on and shit, and i remember seeing that people posted about me and posted about our friendships, however alot of the people posting were people i don't actually have a good relationship with. i also remember reading comments were my ex was saying how much he loved me and that we were still together. I remember thinking i shifted realities because so many little things were off, and people who werent in my life before i disappeared all seemed to have still been cool with me and fully in my life in this reality before i went missing(for example my ex) . Just overall with this dream i was feeling so extremely overwhelmed by the emotion of missing out on two whole years of my life that i woke up. 

The second dream started when i passed right out after the first dream, and it was basically my old best friend from high school and some random people who went to high school with me driving me around in a car and listing all the reasons everyone hated me in high school. Basically just telling me all of my flaws and all the reasons im shitty, and all the lies i've ever told. They were still being chill, and the way they talked was as if we were casually chilling or something which was weird, but they were just explaining to me that no one ever actually liked me. I also ended up at a high school track meet after this, and there i remember asking multiple people if anyone actually liked me when we were in high school and everyone said not really, and that people talked bad about me a lot, and that a lot of people were just being fake with me.

I cannot look to the side, or behind me, so I couldn't see faces, but I **feel** as though nobody had a face. Nobody is saying anything. Everyone is sitting cross legged, peacefully, unmoving, heads all perfectly looking forward, as though they were buddhist monks sitting at meditation. Everyone was spaced evenly apart from one another. 

I have no idea how else to say this but, I then noticed there were giants walking amongst the crowd, smashing individuals one by one, with giant boulders. All I remember is panicking. I couldn't move. The giants would literally just smash a person perfectly, one stroke, and then move onto the next person. Nobody moved. Nobody made a sound. That's all I remember from that scene.

Shortly after that, though, I was thrust into a new scene. Third person perspective, I'm sneaking through a castle, like, on the rooftops/wall walkway. I look over an opening and see giants patrolling the courtyard. I panick again. And that's all I remember from that scene.

Maybe this has something to do with it. I have always believed in the significance of dreams and your subconscious or spirit trying to speak to you through them, but I very rarely have dreams, especially since I found hard drugs, and when I do they are not vivid or memoriable but a few days ago I started having pretty vivid short dreams during mid day naps. An ex from 6th grade is the only significant consistent them. I had a dream today where she was  not only in the dream but the focus of the dream. I felt like she was trying to take me somewhere but I couldn’t not follow as she would disappear. The goal was to touch her face, for some reason this was all I was trying to do. To me touching a persons face is the deepest sign of a affection you can physically offer. At one point I actually did succeed and something incredible happened, I reached a state of some form of nirvana and I began semi lucid dreaming. I was now allowed to follow her around and I don’t remember anything about where we went but every time we touched it was absolutely electric and beyond anything I had ever experienced and some how this unlocked hidden departments of spiritual wisdom and enlightenment between the two of us. It was romantic and physical to a point I had never experienced but also spiritual and indescribably brilliant and I never wanted it to end. I kept falling asleep and experiencing sleep paralysis in this dream, in the setting of the actual room I was in but she would always wake me up and take me somewhere and everything was bliss once again. I’m not sure if she actually is important to what my subconscious is trying to tell me or not, or maybe their is a particular memory or trauma from this time I need to unlock but I just cannot shake the feeling that God or the spirit of the universe what ever is trying to tell me something incredibly profound that will alter my life forever and it’s of utmost importance that I seek that until it’s revealed to me, so I figured the good ol interwebs would be a good starting point. I don’t want to jump the gun and chase this girl down but I also feel the need to see if she has experienced anything like this. Any advice, interpretation?

You can see how that might get a little complicated considering the nature of the relationship, a very confusing intersection of unilateral intimacy (my therapist seems to prefer to call it asymmetrical) and professional boundaries. Before this dream, I maybe had one or two dreams with his physical presence and they didn't seem to have any latent meaning behind them. They were really boring and obvious. He works in the same clinic as his wife, and I am pretty sure I see her coat and various other outergarments of hers hanging behind his door. Yes. I am very jealous of her for sharing a life with him. Seems pertinent. Anyway here is the dream.

\--

I walk into the office as usual, but this time he is facing towards his desk, which he actually recently started to do when I leave, whereas in the beginning of session he actually faces my seat (so his new behavior in real life of facing his desk when I leave is grafted onto when I enter the room in the dream). He is focused on something, or perhaps staring into space, maybe feigning being absorbed -- either way the result is that I feel ignored (much as I so when I leave our sessions). I see three flowers lying on his desk (hard to say they are a bouquet). I ask if it is mine/are for me (can't remember the precise words). Maybe he says yes. Maybe there is just an understanding. But they are mine (now they are at least -- were they initially intended to be?) and I take them. They are calla lilies. Three of them. Two of them white, maybe ivory, but unlike white calla lilies in real life (like the one my brother pinned to his lapel when he was married) they were speckled. I can't recall the details of the speckling. The other one was also white but splashed with one comically bright spot of purple and another equally bright one of yellow, overlapping each other I believe and just to one side of the flower.

What is also noteworthy about the flowers is that instead of the normal bell-shape that calla lilies have these were rather tubular and rigid. I think this mostly speaks to my viewing certain things crudely, not noticing the finer points.

It's really the flowers that were striking to me. And of course the context. In the dream, I remember leaving the session and trying to reflect on the meaning of his giving me the flowers. I came to some conclusion that this must mean he sees me as a friend. But the reflections in the dream are becoming conflated with my reflections in real life, so my reflections on the meaning of the flowers in the dream are sort of lost and obscured my waking life.

0.0,9v5gx2,0.0,1.0,"This dream happened on the night of Oct. 16, 2018. While it does take place in a haunted house attraction, I haven't been in one in well over 15 years. Also, during the month of October this year, I was generally disinterested in Halloween, normally my favorite holiday, for the first time in my life. I feel that might have something to do with this here. Either way, enjoy my dream!


So to start out, I dreamed I was going into this massive warehouse that was converted into a series of haunted house attractions. Each one was set inside of a giant tractor-trailer truck parked in the warehouse, each with its own unique horror theme. One of them, which I didn’t go through, had a post-apocalyptic/radioactive mutant theme, and next to the ramp leading up to the door was [this big inflatable sculpture](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc1bb58884831c9d4c374da8b724118d/tumblr_inline_pgrpwdTc8r1qk914z_540.jpg) of a monster who looked like a living hazmat suit. Its eyes glowed green, and it was reaching out of a puddle of glowing green nuclear waste.

The one I did go through, however, had a more generic “haunted house” theme, but with the additional story of it being haunted by the spirit of a little girl, or infested with haunted dolls or something along those lines. Either way, [the entrance](https://66.media.tumblr.com/34d76e0a5e7085227912bdf91c0ec09f/tumblr_inline_pgrq249YCu1qk914z_1280.jpg) was this little fake dirt path lined with astro turf, with a door set on a painted backdrop of a dark forest. Along the path was this statue of some kind of vaguely bird-headed shepherd, leading a flock of animatronic ghostly things with similar heads. Their little arms/legs rhythmically ticked up and down, and all of them were made of off-white cloth (the “shepherd” was the only one with eyes). Next to the Shepherd was, inexplicably, a model of Zero from Nightmare Before Christmas.

Going through the house was a blur, and the hardest part to remember. All I can recall is wandering through a long dark hallway, occasionally bumping into things or having something drop down at me or pop up from behind a corner, most of which was too dark to make out. There was[ some clever-looking shadow and light effects](https://66.media.tumblr.com/533cd0be6207de395ed3aaba706eb1f1/tumblr_inline_pgrqj7ZPNr1qk914z_540.jpg), but overall it felt rather low-budget and even poorly maintained in some places- some of the attractions seemed to move too slowly or too quietly, or not at all.

The only encounters I can recall with clarity is [this one here](https://66.media.tumblr.com/85831456ed340ac50996d20691e30a90/tumblr_inline_pgrqjjiXFk1qk914z_640.jpg), which I saw peek out from a shower curtain after I poked my head into a bathroom. I also saw [this ugly thing](https://66.media.tumblr.com/d6868f52365f1d885e1a23a5643bf2d5/tumblr_inline_pgrq9frH671qk914z_1280.jpg) I encountered in a dead-end hallway, which I hereby dub “Early Bird”. It didn’t attack or make any noises, just sitting there still as a statue while robotically chewing on the hunk of floorboard it had in its beak. The hole it emerged from was glowing bright orange and seemed bottomless.

Going up a flight of stairs I ended up in [“The Bedroom”](https://66.media.tumblr.com/dc2e5e07b50c6f916e19a6bf1469116d/tumblr_inline_pgrqlc59bX1qk914z_1280.jpg), supposedly the place where the girl’s ghost lived. At first it was rather unimpressive- other than being dark and having some furniture that was pushed out of place, it didn’t look like anything more than an old bedroom. That’s when the wardrobe, facing backwards against the wall, revealed a hidden drawer from which an ugly but very fake-looking doll emerged, cackling with low-quality audio. I could even see the metal arm propping the doll up. It lingered there, still and quiet for several seconds, as if its batteries died.

Finally, I asked “Are you supposed to do something, or…?”

That’s when I heard an annoyed “harumph”. I turned around and there, sitting up in the bed, was an oversized orange and white tabby cat sitting upright, dressed in baby-blue pajamas and holding a teddy bear. It genuinely startled me, mostly out of the sheer absurdity of it all and the fact that I didn’t see it at all when I came into the room. The giant cat just started at me with disapproval, snorted, and went back to sleep. I took that as my cue to leave.

Going out a side door, I encountered a set of spiral stairs, with what I assume was supposed to be [the ghost of the dead girl](https://66.media.tumblr.com/a06ffdc660f0a10692316e01471e10cb/tumblr_inline_pgrqvjdc9E1qk914z_540.jpg). She was “played” by what looked like a teenage girl in a cheap Halloween costume she threw together at the last minute, consisting of a black robe, witch hat, and a feathered bird mask. She laid down upon the stairs tangled in old baby blankets, reaching out to me and grabbing at my ankles, pleading in a raspy voice “Please… I need skin… I need *your* skin…” But her poor choice of costume and hammy performance just left me more confused than anything as she slid backwards down the steps and landing with a loud thump.

As I went down the stairs to the bottom level, I saw her duck into a side room where a stagehand helped her up. She looked like she was embarrassed, almost on the verge of tears. Feeling bad for her, I whispered quickly to her, “I think you did a good job!”

The very last thing I remember was ending up in another hallway lit with blacklights and filled with soft, eerie ambient music. One whole wall was covered with chicken wire, separating the hall from a vast indoor garden of sorts, filled with glowing mushrooms, moss, and other weird plants and fungi. Walking amongst the fungus were [these strange metal robots](https://66.media.tumblr.com/57c310adb5ee817791c035969ef60612/tumblr_inline_pgrr32ataK1qk914z_540.jpg), about two feet tall and three feet wide, bright yellow and totally flat. Their segmented bodies moved on a set of long, thin legs made of wire, and had flat cutout heads shaped like some kind of deer. Their walking reminded me of the “strandbeest” sculptures of Theo Jansen, but a bit clumsier. Right about then is when I woke up.

It started at a park or meadow/field or something. I felt very much like I was supposed to be there but was not sure why. There was a man and another woman I did not recognize and she grabbed my hand to lead me to a tall and barren tree of some kind. It had smooth bark and was light in color. She told me we needed to get started and we attached a ribbon to it. The three of us had an impromptu maypole dance, but before we were half way they disappeared.

I went looking for them and found my significant other (a man), My best friend (a man), a female friend of mine and two women I didn't know. They said we had to leave and then everything went black.

But the dream wasn't over. I woke up and we were surrounded by three people who clearly meant us harm. I couldn't tell if the were men or women but two seemed almost like props. Only one, the leader spoke or moved. It seemed like a man. I only could make out a few words every now and then, but it seemed like he was trying to decide who to torture, as soon as I realized I stood up. 

He asked me very politely to clean up around an area in what looked like a living room. Told me to sit next to the fire place.

I had a dream about two people that have no significant meaning to my life. A girl I no longer am friends with and haven't seen in years because of a bad falling out and some differences, and my husband's co-worker I met twice. 
The dream was: Me and the girl were on a beach, we were just hanging out and having fun. We went scuba diving and under the water I saw a big spider, about the size of a basketball. It was black, fuzzy, and was sitting in a corner watching us. But it didn't have the face of a spider, it's face was a small white skull. I didn't feel scared, just uneasy. When we came out of the water, we were sitting around and she says ""I miss the way things use to be with us."" And I responded ""me too."" 
I had a walkie talkie, and I heard on there ""hey! What's up?!"" I asked who this was and he replied ""it's me *husband's co-workers name*"" I asked him what he wants and he asked me to come inside, I turn around and there is a beach house, almost like a hotel but more of a house. I go inside and he's sitting at a table in the kitchen with some other people that I didn't recognize. And we are chatting causally but the whole time he's starring at me, every time I stretch he looks me up and down, and it's starting to get creepy. I get up and stand in the doorway between I believe the living room and another room. I stretch one more time and he comes up to me and says ""hey I think you know what I want.""

This dream I've been having takes place in a movie theater, a very large one. Large enough to hold probably around 150 people. The theater is filled to brim with friends and family members. Most of the people in there are people that either currently have a close bond with or have had one with. There are a few who are simply there for filler as well. A few people that stand out are one of my ex's, two of my older cousins and one of my close friends. The movie playing is a peculiar movie; it is entirely unique to every person viewing it. It is tailored to each person's desires, emotions, personalities, and experiences. Everyone watching is enjoying the movie once it starts playing. Eyes glued to screen, wide smiles on their faces. Completely captivated. Although, for me the movie is unbearable. There is no cohesiveness to it. It is an incomprehensible mess. Visually it reminds me of a combination of the Abyss in Berserk (will supply a picture for reference) and television static. Sound-wise it is hard to describe. I guess I would say it sounds like a number of people calling out to me telling me to do certain things, but they're all yelling in a very desperate way as if their lives depend on it. Their voices have melded together into this almost unintelligible amalgamation of voices. I cover my ears and try and leave although there are no doors. I proceed to ask the people that stand out the most to me but with no success, they continue to remain engrossed in the film asking me why I would want to leave and saying how great it is. I am left to suffer through the film alone, overwhelmed by the sensory overload until I eventually wake up.

The dream always starts in the same place; at my great aunt and uncle’s house. It’s important to mention that I rarely spent time at their house in the few years we lived in that province, in the early years of my life. I haven’t seen or spoken to these people since I was 4 years old. I was never around them without one of my parents with me. Their side of the family wasn't a part of my life.

I’m standing in a dated living room, on thick shag carpet. The air smells like stale cigarettes, and there’s a loud fish tank with tacky decorations next to me. Something tells me that I need to go upstairs, to the attic. So I begin to make my way upstairs. 

The staircase is dimly lit with a yellow glow, with dingy sconces on the wall. The walls are aged red brick, and the stairs are a creaky, scuffed mahogany. The stairs seem to be huge, and as I walk up the stairs, the staircase narrows and gets darker. When I reach the top of the stairs where the door to the loft/attic is, it’s pitch black. I open the door, and it reveals a small, naturally-lit room with a slanted ceiling, and a small coraline-type door in the center of the back wall. There are shelves lining the walls, filled with antique porcelain dolls. The floor is also littered with these dolls, with only enough room to get to the door at the other side of the tiny room. The second I enter the room, I feel a sense of foreboding. Despite the room being brightly lit with natural light, there are no windows. I begin to get tunnel vision that focuses solely on the small door. In order to get to it, I have to get down on my knees, and eventually my stomach in order to open the small door. I don’t ever get to see what is on the other side of the door. 

Now here’s the twist: Their house is apparently a bungalow, and I have no idea what their house actually looks like or if they ever had a fish tank. And on a larger scale, my Great Uncle is in prison, serving time for child molestation. At the time I began having this dream, I hadn't seen them in several years, was living on the other side of the country, and would have had no way of knowing that he was in prison. I have no idea why I’ve continued to have this dream for the past 10+ years, but the utter fear it causes me is something i’ll never be able to forget. One last thing I should mention, is that my GA was heavily into the occult. She practiced tarot and would use a Ouija board regularly. She was attracted to the idea of angels and demons, fully believing that multiple angels watch over us in our day to day lives. She prayed to angels as opposed to a singular God. Because my parents sheltered us from them, I never saw that part of her life.

The night my grandma (Dad’s mom) died, I dreamt of her... or did she dream of me... (reality has been slippery ever since). This is from my journal entry the morning after.

1-2-11

There was a house that was obviously from the desert (I grew up in the Mojave Desert). The house was tan, dingy. A quarter of the backyard was filled with a swampy lake. My  sister, my cousins (my mom’s sister’s girls), and I were swimming in it with other people without faces. There was a cement walkway that led to the water (my mom and her sister walked out onto it at some point). I swam over to Grandma. She was in a chair with her back to us. She was facing a man without a face. She pulled out a toy: a Jacob’s Ladder that formed into a horse at the flick of her wrist. It developed a crazy texture. I reached out to touch it. My view shifted to where I was in front of her, holding her. She looked different, like a creature. Her eyes were closer together and her ears were really big. She looked into my eyes, and I was holding her face. She told me, “God is calling me.” and she slumped in my arms and became VERY heavy. Then she opened her eyes again and became light. She looked at me again and the dream ended.

My question is really about the horse. The Jacob’s Ladder has become my obsession as the Tree of Life (Kabbalah) as a 2 dimensional representation of the feedback loop from “source/God/everything there is” to “Spacetime”. The Jacob’s Ladder became a silver, metallic horse with a raised dimply texture. The material makes me think of Hematite, a grounding stone. What is the symbolism of the horse? I will include sketches from the journal. I have some idea of what it might be, but have found limited information. If anyone has anything to interpret, it would be greatly appreciated!

The building is a residence hall and we all live on the same floor. 4 stories. The elevator ascends and the doors don’t close, but this time we’re panicking. It keeps ascending past many different floors even though the building is only 4. Each floor kind of looks like a warehouse or a parking garage maybe. On one floor specifically we see a person in the distance in all black. Imagine the Nun from the conjuring, but more witchy. Freaks us all out and the elevator eventually stops. We get out and are in a warehouse filled with board games and comic books. The door is locked from the inside, but I bust a window and we all get out. 

Turns out we had been missing for 5 years not 5 minutes but this twist is likely because my boyfriend has been watching Manifest on NBC. So the remainder of the dream is pretty similar to my understanding of the plot of that show.

Every night before, the elevator doors not closing has been fine, but last night we were all immediately scared and that figure on one of the levels was horrifying. Any ideas on what might be going on? ",hot,"Reoccurring dream that’s pretty normal, but last night was a nightmare",2.0

It was sunny outside. When we were done, I was at the airport, going out to go to my car. I thought to myself that I can’t wait to get plane tickets to see my best friend from a distant country.

Ive being getting over the years random, but similar dreams and they are starting to get me down, I haven't a clue why, or what the heck is going on.
They either start off with me standing on a large stone casket almost or something like that. There's like a white bright light illuminating me. It's a circular room with several different doors. Random faceless people or like bright white clouds of wind things start to come out and ask me questions about things which I seem to answer, but can't remember the questions when I wake myself up. As these things come and then  disappear off again after I then start to spin, not fast but the only way I can describe it is it's like being in a whirlwind. 
They seem to be getting worse, not in a bad way however. I just get more upset then anything as I'm not able to answer some  questions to help people. 
Last night was the worst to date. Started off by me siting around a table with several other people, everyone was talking but there  was a lady sitting to my left with a wooden board or something on the table Infront of her. We were talking, but our lips weren't moving at all. The only thing I said in my mind was you can hear me thinking and she just smiled and nodded. She then said that I needed to go with her as I needed to know things.
At this point we went off. We went to this place with a massive stone structure, rectangle in length. It was a dull ish light but there was this greeny yellow sort of mist coming out if this giant stone thing. There then came out this dark shilloutte, staff thing in his hand and what looked like horns. They definitely weren't horns but an extension of what could of been a head piece. There were more people standing around  this rectangle stone. The man to my right said I'm sorry you need to know, it's my doing. He then touched my arm, all my tattoos started  to move and underneath I'm just covered in werid symbols head to foot. These symbols are shining through bright red in colour. This massive giant figure thing started to spout off this Random funny language. The only thing I understood and that was in English was you need to know who you are... You are the son of Osiris. The man on my right again the one who touched my arm apologised again and said it's my doing, I'm sorry, you are now my responsibility.....
At this point I woke myself up, upset but not scared as such but relieved that I have finally found out after all these years who I am. I woke my wife up and told her. I went down downstairs had a ciggy and I've drawn out the scene..... Eventually went back upstairs to the looks and back to bed. I couldn't get myself back off to sleep. All I could see was this random symbol of what looks like a bowel with a circle in it as shown on my picture and over over again repeating..... You are the son of Osiris.......managed then to eventually drift back off again. I've had to get into Google this morning to find out who this dude is........ :-/

0.0,9tp8yu,5.0,1.0," So  I had this dream last night where Earth is invaded by these alien  beings called Tu'Verans from the planet Tu'Vis. Their culture and  tradition is akin to that of ancient Egyptians, and in fact, it was them  that instructed the ancient Egyptians of Earth and taught them how to  build the pyramids and sphinxes. We all set aside our political and  cultural difference and band together, forming a government called  United Earth. I joined the UESF (United Earth Space Force)

In  my dream, my fiancee Nikki was a Tu'Veran. And she was a princess and a  captain in the Royal Navy of Tu'Vis. Her older brother was a general.  Her Maat Class fighter got shot down during a battle and crashes. I take  pity on her and pull her out of the blazing ship before it explodes.  She recovers but remembers nothing of her life. She doesn't know she's  Tu'Veran. She thinks she's human. She has amnesia, in other words. I  help nurse her back to health and we fall in love. Meanwhile, war rages  on. One day, her memories slowly come back to her, and even though she  is sad to leave, she must return to aid Tu'Vis. She cannot abandon her  duties as its princess and captain. We make love, after which we form a  blood compact. Her blood is now fused with mine as mine is fused with  hers. So I know when she's near and she knows when I'm near. And we are  linked telepathically.

During one of the  heaviest battles of the war, her brother takes command of the fleet and  meets mine head on. I know it's him. Our compact has also allowed me to  sense the presence of any member of the royal family. For a split  second, I hesitate to fire at my lover's beloved brother. He senses that  hesitation and I'm thinking, ""This is the end. He's going to shoot me  down."" But instead, he fires at one of the ships near me--piloted by a  buddy of mine--laughing maniacally. But the thing is he's JUST A KID! He  was a senior in high school, just about to graduate and go to college  when the war began and he was drafted. I promised to take care of him.  To have his six. To keep him safe. I couldn't. I watched as his fighter  explodes before my very eyes. I could do nothing to save him.

For several years (I'm 18) I have had no dream recall whatsoever. Been experimenting with Pukka Night Time Tea & Capsules for about 2 weeks and some Mugwort herb I purchased online. Since my experimentation began my dream recall was increased significantly. I would recall the last dream I experienced before I woke up everynight. These dreams were incredibly vivid. I have had the Dream Leaf supplements for 1 night now and used both the red & blue pill last night. I also used 2 Pukka Night Time capsules (gotu kola, valerian & ashwagandha). My dream was INSANE. Infact, I could recall 2 of my dreams I experienced! I woke up sweating, that's how intense my dream was. I experienced sex with an unknown female which is very very unusual for me.

I also had a very vivid vision of the star constellation ""Orion"".

My question for you guys is; do you believe these vivid dreams that have been induced are tackling my personal issues & what may my dreams symbolise?

We were on a road I didn't recognize and there were two lanes merging into one. There was some bad judgement on her part as another truck pulling a red trailer was merging into the lane, and she didn't slow down. We didn't hit the truck or trailer but it ran us off the road right into a barrier or rail type thing. I knew we hit it because I could feel the recoil and hear the usual noises, but after it happened I looked around and realized I wasn't hurt at all, and neither was the driver. This shook me but not too bad. So we got out to inspect the damage and we realized their was no outside damage. This freaked me out but again not too badly, I didn't understand what was happening. 

So here's where it gets a little bit weird. I opened up the hood to look at the engine, there was no smoke or anything and as I was inspecting it, again no damage. I was freaked out so I looked around and now I wasn't on the side of the road anymore. Instead I was in the middle of a cafeteria at what I could tell was an all boys school. Now, the first girl was gone but another girl who I've liked more and for longer was in her place and suddenly people started like kissing each other on the cheek in a chain. Now i should have been next on the change but the girl I was with instead ran to another guy who I didn't recognize. And then I woke up.

Each empty seat represented another cult member that went outside and committed suicide. I was the last of the audience and didn't believe in anything going on.

On the stage were the two cult leaders, a man and a woman, and two guards. One on each side. The two in the middle committed suicide harikari style, with long daggers; stabbing themselves in the stomach the way samurais used to.

Part of was trying to find the way out of the park and away from the storm so I chose a path that came to a bridge with a person who was saying they would help me on the bridge.

Clarice had been 19 years old and it was honestly time as her quality of life was awful at that age. Blind, deaf, stared at walls, started wearing diapers b/c she couldn't control her bladder. She still had the appetite of a monster, though and always knew the path to my other dog's food bowl even if she couldn't see it. It was when she struggled to go up stairs or stand that we bit the bullet.

Spencer was only 7 when we had to put him down. He'd been suffering from Addison's disease his entire life and we've had our scares regarding him. We always knew his life expectancy was short and I think the loss of my older dog affected him poorly. He hadn't eaten in 3 days and his kidney was failing. It was more of a mercy than anything as he was a timebomb no matter what. Even if he'd recovered, it would only be a matter of time before it failed again.

(Dream) : In my dream, I was in an unknown hotel room that I was not allowed to leave. There were people there I did not recognize who were blaming me for something or other. I wasn't able to defend myself and every time I tried to move for the door, I'd be teleported back to the far side of the room.

I tried talking to some of the people about my dogs but I was constantly told to 'shut the fuck up' or 'stop talking', and I remember feeling guilty and asking if their dogs were okay, as if my talking about my late dogs was rude. I received no response.

All at once, everyone got up and left the room, leaving me alone in the darkness of the hotel room with only a singular light on in the bathroom. When I tried to open the door, it was locked and I was alone.

After a while struggling to drive, I realized that I was actually driving from the back seat. I was alone in the car, but the driver's seat was obfuscating my view of the road ahead of me. I pushed on and eventually made it to my destination. 

I was at a friend's house in the city, and some sort of city-wide party was taking place with a massive mob moving from venue to venue. I had arrived just in time for the festivities near his house. We hung out in the house with hordes of people moving in and out. My girlfriend was with me and my best friend with her. It seemed like it was a great time. 

It was then that I walked outside to have a cigarette by myself. A long lost friend from high school had just exited one of those portable roller coasters that are often at carnivals. We said hello and I looked up to examine the ride, being a thrill seeker myself. 

There was no line and one available seat. 

That's when I saw her sitting in the front car, on the left-hand side with an empty seat beside her. I remembered her from somewhere. It had felt like there had been something between us before, but she was unrecognizable. 

I rushed to take the empty seat. It felt as though it was life or death at that moment. I called out to the operator, ""Stop! Let me ride!"" but it was too late. The ride began, and I resigned myself to watching her ride. As I stared at her memories rushed back to me, but they were vague. She was cavalier, crass, independent and extremely beautiful. I loved her, and I had no true idea why.

She noticed me as she was riding. She stood up in the car of the roller-coaster and waved to me with a big smile on her face, and I waved back. 

After that, I was back inside. My girlfriend and friend were ready to head home, but I left again. I had to see her. 

When I went back outside, everyone was gone. They must have moved somewhere else, and she was with them all. 

I ran into the city center, seeing faces I recognized all along the way. I was screaming her name desperately, but I never got a response. I never saw her again. 

I ran into a sort-of role model, who in this dream I was referring to as V. As I explained the situation to him, he didn't seem to care at all. The dream ended mid-explanation. ",hot,The Girl in The Roller-Coaster,1.0

I was at a gas station that was in the middle of a long stretch of desert road. It was the middle of the night, maybe really early morning, because the sky wasn't pitch black, it was more of a dark blue, so maybe around 4:30 AM.

I was in the convenience store, walking around, looking at the food, when someone spots something in the distance walking in the direction of the store. I move to the door to catch a glimpse and that's when it enters, a large head of cattle, a bit taller than me and much longer. It had jet black fur and a rotting skull for a head. 

It walks in and immediately flops to the floor, as if it was dead. I run out of the store through a side door and try to call 911, but my phone's telling me I'm ""out of service range"". I hang up and then a second or two later I get a call. It's an operator for my service provider, and he's asking me what's going on. I walk around to the front door of the store again and ask an exiting customer if the cow is still there as I fail to stammer out what is going on to the operator.

That's when the cow trots out the door towards the street. I panic and run in the opposite direction, but as it turns towards the edge of the street, it sees me and makes a bee-line for me. I can't get away from it in time and there it is right in front of me.

That skull was disgusting, I remember it was still bleeding and oozing different liquids from where it was attached, and I could see the eyes in the back of the sockets. The horns were long and curled into tight rolls.

This thing was fast and it wouldn't leave my sight. No mater where I ran it was right there, following me without breaking a sweat. I screamed for help and tried to push it away to no avail, it was relentless. I turned every which way, ran as fast as I could, but I couldn't get away from it, this thing just wanted me. It never bit me, though I was deathly afraid it would.

I woke up what seemed like an eternity later, and here I am, writing to y'all about it. I'd appreciate whatever help I can get.

Thanks!

I have had several dreams where I am chasing after this girl trying to get her attention and just nothing. I know she is beautiful but i dont remember any features i just remember this empty feeling that everything im doing to get her is pointless. 

Ive had dreams where i am having sex but i cannot orgasm, just continuous motions and no finish. 

The dreams always remain around this idea. Ive had other dreams where I cannot initiate a conversation or just struggling to keep her interest in me.

I'll start with the necessary information. 

I am a 19 year old, white male. My religion is dominantly Norse pagan (think Odin, Thor, Freyja, Tyr, etc etc). Lately I've been watching a lot of ghost adventures with my fianceé, which has sparked a lot of deeper thinking upon my religion. It's also had me dwell quite a bit on various paranormal topics, which have been putting me on edge. 

My deeper thoughts on religion; While I still follow my gods and goddesses, I have come to the personal conclusion that while we all have our beliefs and religions, they all have a ""holy"" power that can guide, heal, or provide protection, be you Christian, pagan, pantheistic, or whatever you may be. 

Some more information; I live with my mother and step father still. They are both devout Christians. I enjoy falling asleep with YouTube on, almost every night. I also like to write and I write some of the things I daydream about. 

Given this information, I'll start my story. 

Last night, I was having trouble falling asleep, so my fianceé allowed me to call her and I fell asleep with her on the phone, the call time when I woke up this morning showed we had been on the phone for about 44 minutes. My dream, I cannot remember the beginning of, but where I begin remembering is me walking into my room and finding my window open. Somehow, I knew I had not opened it, and I felt something.. off. I immediately shut the window and yelled for my step father, I told him I needed prayer. Without questioning, we both began to pray. What was said, and what was prayed for, I have no idea. All I know is that once it was finished we hugged (I'm not affectionate with him, I've only hugged him maybe 3 times since him and my mother married 14 years ago). The rest of the dream had been me trying to distract myself throughout the night with my phone/social media. From that point, things took a story telling POV, and things felt as if I was writing down a fictional daydream story. I do not feel as if any of the occurrences after the window event are important nor were the center of the dream/nightmare.

The cellar had a single barred window that somehow led to the outside, even though it felt strongly that I had been in some sort of basement. 
The dream began as an out-of-body experience, and dwelled on the image of my younger, nine year old self resting against the wall, looking down at the dreary, torn nightgown I wore. My eyes mellowed out, as if the energy had already left it. Just as I began soaking in exactly what I was looking at, I was thrust into that perspective. No, not just the perspective, I became that nine-year-old version of myself. But here's the thing. What ever emotions I had felt prior to that point, all disappeared at that moment. All that replaced it was the surprisingly familiar nothingness this child had experienced up until this point. It was when I realized that that blood splattered against the stone table was my own. Yet..I thought nothing of it. I didn't care. No thoughts roamed my head, no emotions filled my heart. 
Before I knew it, I had been holding a large, mangled up teddy bear in my right arm, holding it by one of it's torn legs. It was the only thing I seemed to have left.. That was when I began moving. My body seemed to carry out the actions on its own. I slowly rose, and began walking out of the room, the only sound heard being the dragging of my feet, and the teddy behind me, since I only held him by the leg. There was no door restricting me to the room, so I made my way down the hall. Even as I left, the aesthetics didn't change. It kept only this dark, dungeon esq. vibe, even when I reached the next cellar. In there, was my Father. Unscathed, perfectly fine. Though, it was the look that he gave me, after realizing I had been standing by the door frame. 
I released my clutch on the teddy then.
From there, I just dragged my feet over to where my Father's was. Though, my already slow pace was lagging even more noticably now. The whole time, his sorrowful eyes never left my lifeless gaze though. 
Once I finally made it to him...I tried rising my arms..yet, my body refused to move. So, he took the initiative. With his arms tightly around my...he didn't... he didn't even say a word... He just. Clung tightly to me.. Clung tightly, and wept. 
Finally, I was able to tilt my head up, to at least say something, anything. Though, when I tried opening my mouth, the dark realization that I didn't even have the lungs to say anything hit. No wonder I couldn't even hear my breath. 
The moment that realization hit, my head slowly tilted down again. The nine year old now slouched against his father's body.

I see some kind of video where this person (don't know him in real life, but I can tell he's kinda familiar in my dream) has a heart attack or something like that as he's leaving my house. He opens the door and just collapses. This happens the night before.

In the morning, I go get the corpse, for some reason someone moved it farther, next to a tree in a grassy patch, in the sun. I have the hope that I can help with with first aid, like cardiopulmonar resucitation or something like that, despite the corpse being out the whole night. As I come close I see he's kind of decaying, and when I take a closer look at the inside of his mouth, I see there are maggots already attached to the back of his throat, but in a really orderly fashion, they're attache like coocons, like scales.

The next thing I remember is that someone comes and I tell them ""he's dead, go look at his face"" and they go look. At this point, his face is now completely featureless save for a single hole on the front, in the middle, like some kind of weird creature. I remember that this person was like that all his life.

Next thing I remember then, is that for some reason I have the corpse lying down in my aunt's home (face is back to normal), in her bed (aunt is my neighbor). I look at the corpse and see it moving a little bit, its eyes are blod shot, red and black. As it starts moving I desesperately start saying stuff like ""Come on I know you are alive, please say something I know you are alive!"". Corpse starts turning to me and I realize it is about to vomit. As it vomits I avoid  most of the stream but some reaches me a little. I get disgusted and take off all my clothes, to the point of being naked. I lose all my hope because I remember this incident as something (at least in the dream world) fairly common that corpses do as they're in the advanced stages of decay (fluids come out in violent ways). I know he's dead for sure.

Fast forward, all I can remember is that sometimes corpses can awaken and be very dangerous, and as I am checking on the corpse again, I sneak up from the door and see it raised up in the bed (sitting at this point) and browsing the internet on a laptop (lol). He has his back turned to me so he doesn't see him, but I know this is bad because the corpse is awaken and it has intelligence. I leave.

That's all I remember. Thanks!

I dreamt I was swimming at a quarry surrounded by dense woods. The thick lush green trees closing around a pool of aquamarine water, rocks dotting the edge, and a deep black hole in the middle of the water. Seemingly I was with friends/acquaintances because I kept making communication noises back and forth with them like a herd of caribou, and every now and then someone would laugh and then they would all start laughing in unison. The faces were blurred, or should I say swirled as if someone stuck a Kitchen Aid mixer into the middle and twisted the eyes and nose, leaving only wide grinning mouths. The dream was actually quite pleasant in the beginning, sunny with bright colors, a good feeling of having fun with close friends and being carefree. 

At some point I'd decided to swim into the deep part of the water, straight down into the black hole in the center. Looking back up to the surface I could see all the faceless beings standing around the lip of the hole looking down at me as it extended away. I wasn't swimming or sinking further, but the top was getting further from me. I turned and kept swimming down as the cavern walls grew closer and closer, slowing transitioning from grey rock to smooth yellow-green limestone. Eventually the passage got so narrow I was crawling through the water with my arms, the further into the tunnel I got the darker the ambient light grew. I got to a point where I could only inch forward, wriggling my body like a snake trying inch forward into this narrow passage that only kept narrowing further. 

At some point I could no longer move forward, my arms pressed against the sides of my body in this dark underwater tube. I began to panic and flail in the dark, completely stuck and feeling panicked from running low on air when I feel something tickling the top of my head. I crane my neck upwards to look down the tunnel and see a long spindly crustacean-like arm extending from the darkness ahead just lightly feeling me. Looking at the claw I then see the rest of the creature come quickly into view, scuttling towards me at an alarming speed.

Keep in mind this house was built pre-civil war and used as a makeshift hospital during the battle that occurred there. When we moved out the bank took ownership of the house from my uncle who we were renting it from as he took the back off trying the fix the foundation. So anyway we go to the back and the house looks how I last saw it with the back torn off and the patio gone we go to where it was tore off and instantly the house was back to how it was when I was a kid. When we go in we tart having paranormal experiences and demons are everywhere something that looked like my mom tormented us and the house kept going between how it was when I was a kid, dilapidated with the back off and then back to pristine condition like what it may have looked like the day it was built.

&#x200B;

Last night I had a dream in which I was in my childhood home with my mother, but it was present day. She said something about there being coyotes on the loose that the authorities were looking for. Immediately a coyote comes right up to my chest/face, but then quickly goes away because actually it turns out they are not looking for coyotes, they are looking for mountain lions. Two of them. I feel one mountain lion come up to me from behind. I am standing and my hands are resting by my sides, the lion licks the side of my left hand. I am scared but not scared. I throw a piece of meat into the living room--the fancy one that we weren't allowed to use as kids--and slide the door closed. My mom is scared and not being very helpful, I feel like I have to do everything. I am slightly concerned because this room has sliding doors, so I feel like I need to hold the door closed so that mountain lion doesn't get out. We are planning to trap the other lion in there, but never end up finding it.

Some context: I am a white female, 29, single. I am starting a business. And honestly in the most happy and functional place I've ever been in my life.

0.0,9qo2sh,1.0,1.0,"I just woke up from a bad dream. I was walking with dad in a house I don't recognize, when he stopped responding. He grabbed his chest area, I think below the heart, and laid down, wouldn't respond if he was okay. I asked if I should call 911, didn't get a clear response. I thought it was a heart attack but I just didn't get the vibe it was, but something was definitely wrong. He started shaking/having a seizure or something similar to it on the ground and I decided I needed to call 911. I couldn't do it though. I fumbled with the numbers on the phone. First time the 9 got erased so the number was just 11. I kept trying to back-track but there was no backspace button on the phone. Several other iterations of this happened. I never was able to get the call through and felt very helpless.

Then dad recovered. He stopped shaking, came to, and said he was okay. My aunt came in (whose face I didn't actually see, but remember her presence for a moment), and then I saw my dad climb out of a rectangular window in an adjacent room - the kinds that open up by being pushed in (there were multiple windows lined up in this, kinda like a school or similar facility). I was concerned because I wasn't sure what floor we were on, but I looked out the window and saw that we were on the first floor. The area outside the window looked like a campus of some sort, it had clean concrete and a circular, well-kept grassy area in the middle, and some bushes.

I then kept walking forward and a splashing noise caught my attention. I turn to the left to see a bathroom where my two nephews were bathing (water was running, clean). They were a few years younger in the dream than they currently are. The older of the two was wearing a shirt in the tub, which I found strange; the younger was naked although the view of him was mostly blocked by a sink. (These are my aunt's daughter's kids, the same aunt whose presence I remember being in this dream. Dad's sister.)

About that time I woke up feeling very uneasy and worried about dad. I texted telling him I love him and to text me back letting me know he's okay. He hasn't texted me back, but it is 5am so that's understandable.

-----

Dad has been having some money issues as of late; he's had to borrow money from me at the end of each month the past few months, which he returns as soon as he's able to the next month. This isn't really a problem for me, though this month was a bit harder on me financially and so I felt the hit from it a bit more. He also has diabetes which he's found hard to manage; he was recently given a machine which has helped him manage it tremendously but is unable to afford it and is going to have to give it up soon.

My aunt is very frugal, and I have been overspending lately (went a bit crazy with Halloween merchandise.) My older nephew (who's in high school now), the one who was wearing the shirt in the tub, has been suffering with a hard to reach depression.

Is there any meaning I should be pulling from this dream?

I tried looking up some stuff but because it's so specific, it was hard to find any real answers. The Internet suggested seeing dad 'ill' means I should see if he's struggling in other ways in his life and offer help. It says the phone is a sign of desire for communication; the inability to dial signals feeling unsure of myself, and calling 911 signifies a strong desire to avoid something or desperation to get rid of a problem. I wasn't able to find much about the window/campus/what it meant that he was climbing through it. Seeing someone else bathing seems to indicate that I need to help others with important decisions in their life. One site said bathing with clothes on is a particularly bad sign, and indicates burden, illness or treason -- however, it wasn't me bathing in the dream.

I'm not sure what role my aunt/nephews specifically had, if I should be concerned for them or primarily my dad, or if this dream was actually more about me and situations in my own life.

She looked perfectly normal, not out of place whatsoever. So I move on to another page, and there's the album again - except this time she's somewhat disfigured; she's bleeding, and her eyes are missing. Thinking that maybe it was a bootleg for the band or whatever, I click on another record. She's still there, but she's getting closer, and she has a hand out.

She knows I'm somewhat attracted to her and am bi, but also feels comfortable around me because I'm not the kind of person who would cheat on my boyfriend or make unwanted advances. We joke a lot about being the same person because we have very similar personalities to the point where we call each other our ""soul twin"".

Onto to dream itself. I want to point out that I wasn't in my own body— rather I was watching the dream play out like a movie. I was in a hotel room with my good friend (whom I'll refer to as Jen for the rest of this post) and two other friends, both female. The hotel room had two queen size beds, and Jen and I took the one closest to the door to the room and I ""slept"" next to the wall while the others took the other bed, obviously. Our other friends were sound asleep, and I ""woke up"" in the middle of the night to her cuddling me with her as the big spoon and myself as the little. The exact details get fuzzy for a moment, but I remember her waking up and us having a whispered conversation. Jen asked me if cuddling was okay, and I told her yes because I'm a pretty touchy person in real life. She then slid her arm around my waist and moved her mouth to the shell of my ear and asked if I was okay with that, to which I replied that I was. Jen rolled me over so that I was facing her and slid her hand down my stomach and into my underwear. She cocked an eyebrow as if asking if it was alright, and I moved her hand down toward my clitoris. She then began rubbing my clitoris and fingering me (I did the same to her), and we made out while doing that until we both orgasmed. That's about where the dream ended and I woke up.

Knives were both not removed. After the whole ordeal happened, my boyfriend remained nonchalant about it, asking question like “where did that guy come from” & “what did it mean when he said the eyes...” & I had to keep reminding him that we need to go to the hospital and then he was like “I can completely use this as an excuse to call out on Tuesday, the doctor will definitely write me a note” (in real life he’s talked about taking off on Tuesday).

We had a fight two weeks ago and haven't spoken since which is why this dream was weird. Especially considering that he's more mad at me than I am at him. 

In the dream, when I saw his name on my screen I felt dread really briefly and didn't want to pick up but then I felt relief and decided to pick up. On the phone he was calm and he did have some kindness in his voice but it was pretty cold. Like when you're still mad at someone but you HAVE to talk to them.

They usually involve me dealing with high stakes stressful events, like some kind of an apocalypse scenario in which my life, and sometimes many other people's lives, depends on how I handle whatever's going on. I usually fail and die or watch people close to me or even  strangers die as a result of me failing to save them, but then the scenario kind of starts over and it's like I'm given another try. These scenarios usually replay around two to four times before I wake up, and I have other dreams in between them that I never remember as well after I wake up. 

Around the time that I started realizing this pattern of the same scenarios in my dreams repeating, I also started actually somewhat succeeding in surviving these scenarios on occasion, usually after a few times of the scenario restarting. I've definitely failed and died or watched other people die in these dreams way more often than I've actually survived in them. But I've been realizing while I talk to my fiance about it in the mornings that the repeated dreams almost feel like training that I might be getting better at. Like training to handle high pressure life threatening scenarios by having to think on my feet and make important split second decisions, and using resources around me to help, like finding ways to hide or weapons to defend myself. 

For example, last night I dreamed that I was in a futuristic Paris and there was some kind of dictator figure (played by Jared Leto) that was leading a group of followers in finding and killing people in the group that I was in. When I was thinking about it this morning after I woke up, it kind of seemed like the divide between us and his followers was based on economic class, and his followers had some kind of intelligent futuristic technology that made hiding from them difficult. But I never have time to really analyze the scenario like that while I'm dreaming, I just had to figure out how to hide from them and was trying to help others around me hide too. 

I think the scenario in the dream repeated around three times last night in between other dreams. The first time I think I just got shot by the robot people and taken to Jared Leto really fast. The second time I was back in the same scenario, I found a mostly empty house with two other girls that only had a few pieces of furniture in it and a cat. I think the cat's meowing gave us away to the robot people and they busted into the house and shot us. But then the last time I was in the scenario again, I figured out a way for me and a large family to hide out in that house without the robot people sensing us. One of the old ladies in the family I was with said that the cat was hers so I think that's why it didn't meow that time. And then for some reason I thought the robot people wouldn't notice us if we pretended like we were living there and not among the group of people running away from them, and it worked. There were some kids in the family that wanted to go outside and go somewhere to get food because we were starving, and I had to tell them that we just had to be patient and wait there because they would get us if we went outside. The other people in the group were very old and they just kind of seemed like they were in shock. At some point the robot people went by the house that we were pretending to live in, chasing and killing people who were running down the street without noticing us, and then I think I woke up right after that. 

These scenarios in my dreams are definitely scary but while I'm dreaming it's like I don't have time to be scared because I have to figure out what to do. And then while I'm awake, usually at night, I'll think about stuff from my dreams and get scared that something is in our apartment, or if we're outside that something is going to jump out and attack us. I started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago for anxiety and I think these nightmares are probably a symptom of my problem with anxiety, but I've only gone around four times and I'm not really sure if that's helping yet or not. 

These dreams feel very real and I always remember so much of them after I wake up. Does anyone know why I might be having dreams like this? Does anyone else remember so many details from their dreams and feel scared in real life from them? Does anyone else dream that they have to try to survive in scenarios that repeat themselves like this?",hot,Does anyone else get dreams like this?,3.0
0.0,9pxsds,2.0,2.0,"Basically, the dream starts at what I assume to be a modified version of my apartment. 

My former roommate was there. There were also questionable girls there. I'm not sure if their clothes meant they were whores, or if they just liked to dress that way. Doesn't matter. I didn't care for them much.

We take what I can only imagine is called a bullet-train roller coaster to see a movie. I forgot what we were going to see. This was possibly because in my dream I was under the influence of something. I might have been drugged. The maybe-whores were concerned. Or maybe they did it and were feeling guilty.

We stop at Taco Bell before the movie. It's also a museum about H.P. Lovecraft. There were engravings on the wall. I remember one tile looked like it had angels, some kneeling. I remember thinking of Weeping Angels. I don't even watch Doctor Who.

We were at the Taco Bell for a long time. I couldn't make up my mind because they didn't have the normal Taco Bell menu. It was pretty bleak. I didn't mind the creepy engravings, I think I just wanted to see what the $5 Box Deal was. Probably explains why I can't remember there being any other customers.

We go to the Movie Theater next door, still unsure what to watch. Suddenly, a herd of zombies rushes through the theater doors as we're about to enter.

I turn to my roommate and explain to him that the zombies were obviously fake because of the way they ran. I explained to him that the walkers on *The Walking Dead* had to pass a test to see if they could behave like zombies.

We went in to watch the movie. I don't remember what it was. It might have been horror.

Now it's the next day. I am driving to the Lovecraftian Taco Bell with somebody, who I think was my brother. I'm pretty sure. I think in my dream, that in my drugged state, that I had applied to work there. 

I believe we were on the road, and I told my brother to take a left into the parking lot.

I was in a store with others. Something happened and three men held the people in the store hostage. The three men had guns. They had planned on killing us.

I some home got away aNd ran as far as I could away from the man who chased me. I ran into this house that was unlocked Nd decided to look for any weapons. 

I didn’t find much but the lady who own the home cake home. She was startled but i told her my situation and she allowed me to stay she even gave me what I THOUGHT was a weapon.

Eventually i realized she too had ill intentions and i ran from her into her back yard. She had a deck. I was hanging from the ledge because it was the safest place for me. As I was hanging more people came Atleast ten laughing and hoping that I would fall so they could harm me. One even said I was pretty smart. My arms got tired so I decided to jump off and just run.

I ran very fast and they almost caught me. Thankfully they didn’t. I ran and fell into his big group of people who were all sitting on blankets and listening to music. It had to be Atleast 100+ people. I was so in shock and scared that i thought they were bad people too but they weren’t. They were so full of love. I hugged one girl so tightly because I was so happy to be there. 

Oddly enough i look to my right and there are people far away from us harming each other. There is nothing separating us from them except energy. 

I was so happy that i begin to dance. Eventually everyone that were within that group started dancing and we were just having a grand time. As we were dancing the energy started to weaken and the people got a little bit closer. The “ Elite” told us to calm down or they will be able to get us so we all sat down and started vining to the music. We went forward right back left with our upper bodies.

* I left a long term (in hindsight toxic) relationship for him

* I had been infatuated until the end

* The relationship lasted about 2 years during which he made hints about the future, that his place would be mine one day, that it was good I love to travel because he does too.

* I'm now in my mid 30s, not married (but living with a boyfriend), never had kids, not really interested in it, bit I have sometimes wondered if I might be missing something.

* I am feeling like I'm aging lately.

* He (I believe) is still married to the woman he left me for. I know she moved in with him right away and got pregnant within a year or two.

I’ve been dreaming of snakes a lot recently. I’ve always liked snakes and had one as a pet growing up, so no negative associations. Last night, my dream centered on two snakes, both of which were “mine” in a cage. They were of the same size and species. One snake was brown - this snake was in the process of shedding its skin. The other snake was orange. The brown one, I think, was a newer addition. After it sheds, it and the orange one become intertwined with each other, almost like a Gordian knot. But they don’t, like, merge to become “one” snake. There were external events going on, but they seemed trivial/arbitrary and the snakes were definitely the main focus of the dream.

That’s all I remember, but it stands out clearly. Notably, my last snake dream (9 days ago),  also involved a “domesticated” snake shedding its skin. There was only one snake in that dream - it was the same color/species, but smaller in size. 

Given the important symbolism of snakes, the fact that snake dreams have been recurring for a few weeks, and the fact that this particular image was, for me at least, evocative of the Ouroboros (though this could be a misinterpretation), I wanted to see what you all think. 

EDIT: also, I’m into guys and thinking about starting to date again, once the divorce goes through (we’ve been separated for over a year).

0.0,9pi7s3,2.0,2.0,"This dream happened a few months ago. First, I'll write what I remember from the dream. Then I will write about the reason I am posting. 

The dream: 

As I said, this dream happened a few months ago. So some parts are fuzzy but the main event is so vivid. Part of the dream was in my own perspective, and I was participating in a mundane activity (drinking waters next to a table) with a random person (in the dream I believe it was my boyfriend but it didn't look like him or anyone I really know).

 Suddenly, the entire dream changed and I was looking at a picture of the event, I saw a picture of two people standing next to a table, but it was all brown, like a sketch or an engraved plank. And everything was moving very very slowly. The picture was moving so slow but I could still tell it was moving and life was happening. I knew I needed to pull out one of the people in the picture.

Then the perspective switched again and it was in third person. I couldn't see the demon (although I knew it was a demon) but it was a side view of the painting and a force pulling out one of the people with a demonic voice in the background. Just as the demon was about to pull out the person, my dream ended or I woke up.

My interpretation: the demon was in another dimension attempting to possess a person by pulling them into his dimension 

My reason for posting: I had forgotten about this dream a couple days fter it happened, but it's back on my mind now. It was definitely the scariest dream I have had in my life. Also one of the most vivid and most surreal. Usually my nightmares are about me being back in highschool and I forgot to do the homework. 

I can't stop thinking about it. I have no idea why my brain would create something like that.

I consider myself a rational person but I'm almost terrified that I was witnessing something real in my dream, because of how vivid it was. (Also it's Halloween and I've been seeing tons of spooky stuff that has probably been making me think about scary things more often and this the dream)

I'm 24, male, a more individualistic, literal, independent thinker (in other words, I am less emotive than others), live in South Africa, and at the moment I'm finishing off an Honours degree in economics (development economics is one of my subjects), carrying on to Masters next year. Obviously, you don't know enough about me to fully understand the meaning of the wounded person that I was looking after in my following dream, but perhaps you have something useful to say about my dream. I'd say that at the moment I'm trying to find a new girl to date, so that issue may be in my subconscious. I was mugged in April, so it isn't surprising that I still have dreams that involve knives and violence.

# My dream

I was trying to get away from some antagonistic people. They were on foot, and I was on rollerblades, but I had some obstacles to get over, like low fences. This was at my old high school. I got away, and was rollerblading down road outside the school. There was a lot of traffic, but I was filtering through it. I went past a bus, and saw someone get stabbed inside it.

The scene modified so that I had been inside the bus instead, skating down the aisle, when I saw the man get stabbed by two people sitting next to him. The passengers were disgraced and wanted to get out, but the bus driver said that he had a tight schedule and had to drive consistently for the next 16 hours or so. The passengers protested, fearing for their safety, and demanded that he stop so they could get out. He stopped, and I and all the passengers got out except for the two men who had stabbed the guy. I got my backpack out the storage, and then helped the wounded man out the bus.

The crowd of passengers dispersed, and the bus driver was in a hurry to get away. The wounded man, myself and another passenger were now stranded in an unfamiliar place at night-time in the middle of Hong Kong. I needed to get the wounded man to the hospital urgently. We flagged down a taxi, and asked him to take us to the nearest hospital. He told us that there were no hospitals in Hong Kong, so he would have to drive three hours to China to get to one. I tried finding a hospital on Google Maps, and couldn't find one nearby. This was a big decision, but I made up my mind and became adamant that we needed to go to the nearest hospital, even if it was in China, and told him that we needed to go to the emergency ward as all hospitals have a 24-hour emergency intake ward. I was perplexed as to why there were no hospitals in Hong Kong.

So we proceeded the long journey, travelling along a lonely freeway, dimly lit by street lights. I watched the Chinese road signs and markings with mild interest as I gradually accepted that this was the only way to get to a hospital. After travelling on a well-built, four-lane highway for a while, the road turned into a dusty dirt road. It was morning now. The road traversed through a squalid community—the worst poverty I had ever seen. It made me realise the importance of studying development economics. Poor people blocked the way, seemingly unconcerned about our plight but more concerned about the inequality that separated their filthy lifestyle from our clean, air-conditioned interior. A dead body wrapped in cloth was in the road, but the taxi driver drove over it as if he was used to this. 

Eventually, frustrated, I told the driver that we needed to find a hospital immediately for the man on the back seat. The driver complied, stopped the car and took us to an unused dormitory inside a building. He pulled one of the beds close to another, and instructed the wounded man to lie down. I suppose he was going to try to be a doctor, but I decided to wake up.

# Interpretation

*Apart from the usual theme of me escaping from an antagonistic person, the other main theme here was me taking responsibility for the wounded man, and deciding that we should drive three hours to China to try to find an emergency ward in a hospital. I was being responsible and making an adult decision in a fairly uncertain situation. Inequality was also on my mind, as the car had made its way through destitute areas.*",hot,No hospitals in Hong Kong,1.0

In my dream, I get a phone call from my mom. On the other line, though, all I could hear was gasping and wraspy breathing. Panic hit me, and I knew she would die if I couldn't get to her. 

I ran to my husband's room, which is locked (irl he has an ""office"" in our house, keeps the door locked to keep kids from bursting in). I starting beating on the door and rushing him to hurry to take me to my mom because she's dying and needs help asap. He is SO slow, taking his time, he seems to not care how urgent this is. (Irl he makes us late to literally everything and has a chronic problem being slow/late). I'm begging him to hurry. 

He does finally make it out of the room, informing me he has to use the bathroom first. (This aspect also rings accurate to real life. One thing that makes us late is him having to use the bathroom before we leave). I'm feeling helpless at this point and in disbelief that he is taking so long considering the urgency of the matter.

I am fed up with waiting... I try driving myself (irl I can't drive due to vision problems) and I can't make the truck work right so I end up making a block and coming back to the house to see if I can get him to come the hell on.

I run inside and start beating on the bathroom door frantically and yelling for him to hurry.... no answer. So I kick the door in, my husband is standing in front of the toilet with his pants up. He's fallen asleep standing with one foot on the toilet seat and his body propped against the wall. He's pissed himself. In the dream he has passed out because of drugs in some way.

I am livid. I grab him by his shirt and shake him awake. I say, quite angrily, ""get your shit together and get off the drugs, this is pathetic""

   They all had masquerade mask white excpet for one. She was like the leader of the group. They other ones were like copies of them selves they looked exactly the same. The one without a mask was different taller and etc. So there was a table with pasta with some kind of tomato sauce. Kind of like spaghetti/pasta to go. Crystal(crystola (a frien of mine she is 19)was talking to a older women) about her life problems meanwhile i was asking about why does the pasta have no meat. There were like pasta to go food, guess she was selling it. So i got ignored and was like well ill lie down, there was like a bench nearby so i lied down. After i lied down like 3 secs after the girls with mask arrived.

* I'm in the passenger seat of a car with a few other unidentified people. We're moving through a futuristic city on a bright day. I am comparing the city to New York, noticing how this place has no visible historic buildings, as if all of the infrastructure had completely replaced whatever may have been here before. I felt like America was behind by comparison. But there were also no trees. We were going to a kind of warehouse game room, similar to an escape room but more elaborate and apparently not much sense to it. Unable to figure out the rules, I decided to just collect materials and defend myself from the enemies (staff dressed as marauders). We were quickly attacked when the game began, and I ended up throwing myself fro ma four story balcony, using one of the big guys as a meat shield. We were both fine, but I did feel bad about it. The rest of the experience was pretty chaotic. I was so busy watching my flank and randomly collecting things like ropes that I never was able to couple up with any of the other players or figure out exactly how to get ahead in the game.",hot,"Grandma killed the rooster, the angry cat-moth, a future city, a chaotic game",1.0

I don't know whats going on between us but we've encountered each other and had ""battles"" before. I get the feeling that its me or him. There is no chance of reconciliation. There is some kind of time honored antagonism between us and we are just standing there looking at each other from across the table. 

Then out of nowhere I get this immense feeling of trust and familiarity for the man. The tension and antagonism is still 100% there but I realize that although he is my enemy, I know him extremely well. I know he wants to defeat me but I also know that he ""plays by the rules"", and won't pull any dirty tricks on me. He forever longs to defeat me, but he can be trusted absolutely to do it in an honorable way (if that makes any sense). 

I run over to a closet and open it (knowing it will be empty) to show him that I know he doesn't have anyone waiting in there to ambush me. I run to the table and wave some food sitting there in the air before him indicating that I KNOW that he would never try and feed me poisoned food.

He was my worst enemy but he was also the most trustworthy person I had ever known, and I had an immense respect for him and even a feeling of affection.

Hello to all of you folks. I like to share one of my dreams, bear in mind that the dream I am about to share is not yesterday's dream, so my memories of this dream are not 100% correct.

So it appears that I am some sort of detective in this dream, as I have a revolver and about to chase down this mysterious women. \[I am certainly that I wasn't criminal in my dream, since I did not had criminal mindset in a dream\]

So yes, I am about to chase down this women and it appears she isn't your ordinary street type of criminal. In front of me was a 3 store house, that looked more like a some sort of a castle. I see some lights coming from one of the windows.  
Scene changes as now I am inside and watching that women waiting for the moment to strike. By the room environment it looks like the action takes place in late XIX or early XX centuries. She lives alone as there is no other lights or sounds coming. In my mind I said that it's time. As I quickly spurn into action and was ready to shoot her, she grabbed the shotgun and shoot my shoulder.

Suddenly scene completely changes as I am in a hallway with a lots of ""metallic""/""heavy"" doors. I see her running and I began running after her. My shoulder was still wounded, yet I almost managed to catch her. She goes through the one of the doors and as soon as I get through the door myself, I appear in yet another hallway. I see her in the end of narrow hallway, I quickly shoot. Sound of shattering glass. ""Dammit, it was her reflection"" I say to myself as I see her running sideways the mirror. \[Can't really explain\]

I was emotionally appealed by a girl, whose face wasn't really a face. It was some kind of holographic mask hiding her head and neck.

I understood that the girl was completely disfigured under the mask, either from a terrible wound or a congenital anomaly. I felt the strong need to hold her against me, and I did.

I dreamed that the frogs, crickets, and crows were essentially people, that is, anthrophormorphized with language and clothing.  The main characters were a king frog, a sorceress frog, and a huge brown cricket. There were also nameless frog soldiers and officials. The sorceress frog had a green sparkly scarf and the king frog had a red regal robe. There was a war going on between the frogs and the crows and the frogs were the protagonists of the story. The frogs were preparing for war and thpugh no battle had started yet, the tension was palpable. In the midst of The frogs was a large male brown Cricket, who was some sort of ambassador and friend to the king. The cricket had a very calm and confident demeanor at the beginning of the dream, but he started going crazy saying he wanted to be sacrificed to the crows in order to start the battle and kept trying to escape the castle knowing if the crows saw him they would dive down and eat him and start the fight. He wanted to die and wanted to die a martyr, and was yelling and charging the door to leave The castle.  The frogs tried to contain him but the sorceress frog had cast a spell on him and he broke free and ran out the doors and started yelling for the crows to come get him, and a swarm of crows dived down. The crows killed the cricket quickly by splitting open his back with their beaks and the battle started. There were frogs and crows fighting to the bloody death. The king frog attempted to come out and help but instead of killing him the crows shoved him back into the castle and locked the door because they knew the battle would be easier without the frogs having a leader. The sorceress frog helped seal him in the castle . The sorceress frog was then betrayed by the crows and was swarmed as soon as she stepped out, having fulfilled her use. The frogs eventually fought the crows off, but it was a bloody fight and there were corpses everywhere with backs split open from crow bites and crow claws. Even the cricket was still left dead on the ground with his back split open. That's when I woke up. I think I may have been a frog, but I was not an integral part of The story. It was more like watching a movie. The dream ended with me walking back across the battlefield over the dead frogs and seeing the dead cricketand sorceress near the entrance of the castle.

I do not have any special links or affiliations with any of the above mentioned animals. It was a little random to me. I was a little taken aback by how gory and detailed everything was.

Sorry for the long wall of text but please read it.

Over the last year, I had a very similar dream ""story"" three times, but with completely different circumstances.

The first time was about 2 years ago. In the dream, I was at a friend's birthday party and there was a girl. I've never seen her before and she doesn't resemble anybody I know in real life. However, over the course of the part, we came closer to each other and started to make out at some point. Then the dream cut to the next day and we talked about a relationship and being together (keep in mind that this all still is within the dream!). I even thought about that I would be happier with her than with my girlfriend and that I was going to break up. Then I woke up.

What should be noted, though, is that a few days ago, I really was at a birthday party of said friend and there was a girl I once had a crush on, but we were now just (really good) friends. So I dismissed it as my brain just digging out some old feelings.

I don't remember that much of the second time this occured but it was a similar situation: some friends, I think at a little party at a lake. There was this girl and at some point we went a little away from the other people to be alone. Again, I've never seen her before and it was a completely different girl. Again, my it felt like I really had feelings for her.

This night was the third occurence of this. I don't know how we got to the situation but this time I already was with a girl, driving somewhere. This time it already felt like we had something going on. Like we were in a new relationship, or something. It felt differently this time, though. I can't completely describe it but it felt like I *knew* what was going on. That this was a dream. I wasn't lucid but I somehow know that something wasn't real. The next thing I knew was that I woke up, bathed in sweat and full of adrenaline.

Is this something common? What scares me about that is that I really love my girlfriend, we are happier than ever and I couldn't wish for more. So maybe you guys know if that has some meaning or are just random dreams.

I was standing back and watching.  I was wearing a smooth, featureless, silver mask (though I could still see through it) with a dark cloak and hood over it.  There was someone else standing with me.  I can't imagine who because they were similarly costumed.

And there came a point where my partner and I started pulling people out of the pile and slitting throats.  And not a single person fought back even though they watched us do it.

Dream 1: Most recent one, I was with this detective guy and we were going through these different places of work. One of them happened to be a kitchen (like restaurant kitchen) and as I walked back into the fridge, I saw this lady dismembering something I won't name because it's a bit much. Then later on in the same dream, we were in a hospital and there was acid of some kind on a door and my knuckle touched it. My skin melted off and I could see the bones and tendons moving (this has been a bit concerning to me because it looked really cool and I've been getting urges to take off the skin irl)

Dream 2: For some reason, I had to amputate my pinkie. Again I thought it was cool in the dream, but in reality if I lost a finger I would be extremely devastated.

Dream 3: Everyone had eyes on their abdomen, (dream logic) and I had the inexplicable urge to rip my abdomen eyes out. Instead I kinda popped them and so they just kinda hung there deflated.

Dream 4: There were these ogre and/or orc like beings and they were arguing, violently. There's this door and it has a weird doorknob, there's like a bowl type thing under the knob itself and there's a gap in the wood between the knob and bowl. Anyways one of the ogre things grabs the other and pushes it into closet in a weird position, then it closes the door and the other thing starts screaming cause it's face got stuck on the bowl thing and then it dies.

Dream 5: A wall in my room has a creepy face, permanent smile, eyes with no eyelids, and it's saying something (can't remember) then suddenly blood is pouring from everywhere and I get these cuts all over me and I die.

I do have quite a few friends but they are all from my early childhood and I have a lot of acquaintances that I wouldn't consider friends, but we chat. I am a shy enough person and rarely go out of my way to make new full on friends. I love spending time with them and equally spending time on my own, though when on my own, I'd usually text friends daily. I have a large family and we are close. I get great satisfaction in helping my friends and family with things, I like to feel needed, be it a computer problem, advice or even lending money. I make it seem like a hassle(seems to be the way in our family) when I'm asked for something but I always do it and get a good feeling after. I'm sensitive in that it's really easy to offend me, but I also forgive easily.

I am self employed. It's a small store in a small town, my grandfather is my only employee (he's in his 60s). I love the industry I'm in but I hate dealing with the public. Work is good, business is getting better all the time and there are no worries in that regard. 

The dream:
I've had this dream twice, kind of. The first bit was the same both times but the second time, it was slightly different and it was longer.

It starts with my all my friends, family and I on a plane going on a big group holiday. We are flying over a snowy mountain range when the plane starts to have an issue. We make an emergency landing in the mountain (definitely an emergency landing, not a crash). Nobody is harmed and we disembark. We are in the snow, cold. Rescue vehicles from a nearby ski resort arrive and pick us all up, they bring us to the resort which is like a village. We can't get down the mountain tonight because the weather is too bad so we have to stay there. We are put up in a big house, kind of like a Manor type bed and breakfast. The owner was very welcoming.

This is where dream 1 ends.

Dream 2:
Everything happens the same up to the point where we get to the resort/village. We get to the Manor only for some reason, I am the owner this time and I am wealthy. We all settle in and eat. I decide to throw a party, the only guests are friends and family, those that were on the plane. There were no strangers. Everyone is drinking and socialising when I get word that somebody has has been stealing from me, like embezzlement and is trying to get everything, all the money, not just some, all shares, company everything. At this point I don't know who it is. I carry on as if everything is okay, mingling and talking to the people at the party. At one point, my oldest friend's (she just had a kid irl, I will be godfather) boyfriend says something to me in conversation which makes the penny drop and I say ""it's you isn't it?"" And at first he doesn't know what I'm talking about but I push him and eventually he smirks, giving himself away. I tell him he's going down for this and make to leave. He says he's going to make me stay quiet for good and I run, at this point the rest of the guests know nothing. I manage to get clear for long enough to call the authorities, he finds me just after and I run again. I make my way to a hidden stairs, a kind of a butler's stairs that they would use to get around the house quickly and unseen. I hide here until the authorities arrive and when they do, I come out and he is taken away.

Dream ends here.

So it started with me, my girlfriend, and 3 of our mutual friends all in some sort of Church hall. It was fine we were talking and just enjoying ourselves, when one of my friends holds out a pair of sunglasses (think those wide framed 3-D glasses) and tells me to put them on. I do, and then a video starts playing on the glasses. At first I think it’s great, but then I feel uneasy. The video starts to load from the bottom up very slowly, and I can make out a clown costume very much like Pennywise from the recent IT, and as it loads more and more I can see blood on the costume. I begin to panic and can’t remove the glasses. Before the picture can load my girlfriend pulls them off and it’s all fine.

Then this tour guide appears and drags us out of the hall, and into a European style city. They tell us that they’re going to bring us to some touristy land marks. We start walking and one of my friends sees this really narrow staircase which goes down into the street. The staircase is only wide enough for us to go down in single file, and although the tour guide tells us not too, the friend runs down them, so we all follow them, with me being the last one in the line.

We follow the stairs down into a large, empty room with a singular man standing in it. He’s fully clothed and looking at us through a pair of opera glasses. He turns to us and immediately starts to rub himself all over. Not in a sexual way, as if he’s cleaning himself with an invisible cloth. The tour guide tells us to run, so we run past the man and down another set of narrow stairs. I turn to see if he’s following us, but he stopped at the top of the stairs. I turn back and everyone else has vanished. I still run down the stairs, afraid of the man at the top.

Then I enter another large room similar to the previous, but this one is full of people all rubbing themselves. The room is dead silent and my friends are not there at all. I run through the room to an open door at the end. None of the people touch me or even acknowledge me. I run through the door and down a hallway, which has a few more of these rubbing people. 

The hallway leads to an old, abandoned, stereotypically creepy hospital. All the doors around me are slightly ajar, and before I can do anything, all the doors swing open suddenly, and behind every door is a giant mouth with blue lips and white skin. The mouths then start to scream in unison, and black eggs pour out of their mouths.

i dreamed last night that i traveled to Mars and found a alien civilization of intelligent feline people. i discovered they were at war with humans invading there planet,i had a disguise to pretend to be one of them. eventually i told a group of close friends were i was from and that most humans don't even know they exist and my planets governments were hiding the truth from our people.they did not believe me at first but the girl i fell in love with there convinced them to keep it a secret. later i was shot protecting there President from a attempted assassination by a human soldier,but it damaged my hologram generator device and they found all found out i was a human.i then explained the situation to the public and confronted the soldier who called me a traitor to my race.he represented one or more of earths governments seeking to genocide the native population of Mars and he hated me on a interpersonal level because of my religion which was different than his and because i was in his words a abomination.then my girlfriend in the dream ran up to me a kissed me in front of her whole planets media.i woke up shortly after the kiss.

10/5/2018 i dreamed i was searching for something and could not find it.i can't remember other details.

10/7/2018 (sleep interrupted by my brother)i dreamed i was in a large building with many rooms in a hallway,one was a courtroom,then a public bathroom,then a elementary school classroom,and finally a corporate office where i met a secretary who offered to show me around,and lead me to a room with 4 women... and i was woken up.

10/8/2018 i found a glitch in a popular video game and became somewhat famous for it,then i was given a secret code in the game to give me special abilities, later i have given the same abilities in real life and told to use them to save the world.

10/9/2018 at the start of the dream i step of a elevator into a crowed office,i am apparently the boss and after attending to all the people who demand my attention ,i exit the office into a private home/apartment and then i change out of my pantsuit into a cheetah-print bikini(in my dream my breast have gotten larger than real life) and head to a private indoor swimming pool. there is a beautiful woman there by the pool side exercising lifting heavy weights.(she is incredible from the bottom of her feet to the top of her afro) she stops and walks over to me and kisses me,i then notice i am wearing a wedding ring (and she is too). we relax my the pool cuddling for a while,then i go in for a swim,after i am done swimming she comes into the shallow end with my and begins kissing the side of my neck,then she takes my top off and begins massage my breast with her hands and i turn around and she begins licking one of my nipples and she reach her hand into my swimsuit and puts one ,then two and finally three fingers inside me. i orgasm so intensely my body shudders. then with her out of the pool wading her feet in i pull aside the crotch of her one-piece and begin to put my tongue inside her.(i am then abruptly woken up in a cold sweet by my brother being loud in the morning)

10/10/2018  i dreamed i was shopping at a store,i went in to the aisle with trading card game and started to put some from a game i liked into my cart,then i saw a set of non-tcg trading cards with my face on them. i was so euphorically happy i let out a scream of delight,i garbed as many of them as i could afford and when to buy them,then at the check out line i had a hard time doing math at the cash register . (i normal know exactly how much change i am going to get) then i woke up.

10/11/2018 i dreamed i was on the starship Voyager(star trek) and we were under attack from reptilian space alien Nazis(i'm a Trump voter when i say Nazi i mean actual Fascists ethno-nationalist not right wing economic nationalism that gets dishonestly labeled as racist by leftist). there was a phaser fight in a cargo bay and dead bodies from both sides everywhere,we ultimately won but paid a heavy price for our victory. also i fellow crew mate that i was attracted to rejected me because she was straight,and i was disappointed. she was beautiful and she looked a lot like me except she was a blond. i usually don't get rejected in my dreams because most of the women are lesbians like me so this was a surprise.

10/12/2018 last night i had a nightmare about being bullied in elementary school. people who bullied me in real life were in the dream and they broke hundreds of dollars of dvds i owned (the dvds were of the anime Sailor Moon and Chibiusa was on the cover-art)and the teachers did nothing about it. then in the dream i get home only to have my family blame me for happened.later on late at night when everyone else is asleep i put on a bikini and went swimming in the pool next to my home(which i did not have in real life) and felt relaxed and at peace .

10/13/2018 i dreamed last night about shopping on-line for a swimsuit then going to the grocery store then voting(it must have been election day) and getting something to eat at a restaurant. and i did it ALL naked and did not feel ashamed or embarrassed at all . then i woke up.",hot,my dream journal,1.0

She managed to grab the heroin off of me and i had some on my fingers but had somehow gotten some of the heroin in my own mouth, leading to my mum stopping the car and me throwing her out and leaving her behind then we drove off.

0.0,9nph24,2.0,1.0,"So I had a dream the night before last that was exceedingly strange and I'm interested in hearing some other people's thoughts.  I'll describe what I can remember but there are random stops and starts to the plot so I'm assuming that there might have been some sort of coherent story and I'm only able to recall bits and pieces.  

&#x200B;

The dream started with me apartment shopping with (I think) my mom and my current roommate.  The building was gray stone covered in moss and surrounded by trees but it was a massive skyscraper on  a hill that looked out onto a city.  The apartment was on the 170th floor.  It was a really nice place with a gorgeous view overlooking the city.  

Then in the apartment I had some sort of weird bug in my hand.  I can't remember if I'd found it and was trying to kill it or if I considered it to be a pet, but one of them sounds right.  It almost looked like a quarter sized light blue sand crab.  I kept trying to grasp it but it kept slipping through my fingers like a soap bar that you try to squeeze.

Next thing I know, I'm outside on the bottom floor, having no recollection of how I got there.  We were walking out of the building and I remember wondering, even though I had just been upstairs to the 170th floor, if the building had an elevator, then convincing myself that OF COURSE it did, but what do I do if it breaks?  My fit as fuck roommate climbs 300 flights of stairs on the stair master in an hour so what am I gonna do if I have to walk up all those stairs?!

The dream then randomly takes a weird turn.  At this point I'm back up in the apartment looking out the window, which takes up the entire city half of the wall and shows a beautiful view.  I'm looking out the window when I see one of the tall, glass skyscrapers in the distance tremble.  I freeze in my tracks, thinking that I was going insane.  Then all of a sudden the building sways, cracks in half, and falls.  I immediately start sobbing and my mom, sitting on the couch, turns to me and says ""Why are you so upset?""  Through my sobs I exclaim, ""Do you have any idea how many people probably just died in there?!""  When I look back out the window I see another, closer skyscraper do the same thing.  At this point, I realize that something absolutely insane is going down so I run over to the window and look down so I can see what is happening by the ground.  I then realize that a horrific, massive, sleek, black creature with sharp cone-like hands and a head the shape of a motorcycle helmet is smashing through the city.  The creature turns toward my building, starting to sprint in our direction and I stumble backwards as it pulls its arm back to strike the lower floors of the building.  

I look over and my mom is still sitting on the white couch next to a massive pig.  All of a sudden the creature from outside is human sized and inside the apartment, spearing through the pig with its sharp cone hands.

It started out I was at a work function, where I wasn't allowed to talk or share any information with anyone. It had a very ""Equilibrium"" movie vibe. I remember we were searching for something at this function, and then we were dismissed. As we were leaving, I had to put on this weird coat that was gray and covered up everything but my face. I was walking home, on the edge of this canyon, and about 500 yards to my left and up a little plateau, was a settlement, ""Settlers of Cattan"" to be exact. It was snowy and icy, and I was bracing against the side of the plateau edge when an avalanche happened. I ended up getting covered and buried in the snow, but because of this odd, thick, gray wool covering, I managed to survive. I dug myself out of the snow and followed a small group of men from the settlement to a safe house. I was not allowed to talk to any of them. I actually had to hide from superiors. 

The group of men consisted of one man with a ""dad bod"" body, red hair, beard, glasses (totally my type if I were dating). 
There was another man with the mental acuity of early teens boy. He was mentally disturbed, and just clung to me like a spiritual attachment. His emotions were unregulated. He was obsessed with me. I had to give him all of my attention. He was insanely jealous and would freak out if I talked to anyone else. 

Back to the ginger dude. He invited me into his room to get away from jealous dude. In his room he had A LOT of Seattle Supersonics memorabilia. We were talking about the team, and how Seattle is missing having a basketball team. He gave me a few of his memorabilia, and I squealed and kissed him. We were essentially making out and a supervisor broke in and found us. This was HUGE against the rules. Instead of outwardly reprimanding me, I a icy cold demeanor.

0.0,9nl7m8,0.0,2.0,"Last night, my husband really hurt me emotionally. And I didn't get much sleep. I managed to drift back off for a little while this morning and had a really really weird dream. Not my typical dream theme here. 

So, it starts by waking up late to get my son dressed and off to school. I argue with him (he's 5 and this often happens in reality) to get dressed. 

In reality, husband came home drunk last night and, without going into too much detail, this is a breaking point for our marriage. 

Reality carried on into my dream, as he was hungover and mean in my dream. He is responsible in real life for taking our son to school, and in my dream he flat out refuses to do so because he's an hour late. I feel panic because he has to get to school. I don't care it's an hr late. He needs to go. For some reason, the place we're in looks like my parents' living room. 

I get very upset in my dream, and I'm also not dressed. I'll in my pajamas, hair a mess, groggy, just rolled out of bed. My parents come over and I tell them what's going on. They side with my hungover husband. I'm so so so upset. They don't see it as a big deal (not like them in real life). 

So I go lay down for a minute, but then I need to go to the bathroom to pee and get dressed.. I exit whatever room I'm in and now I'm in a large pier 1 rustic looking trendy living room with all of his family apparently over for some party I forgot about. I'm still looking like I just rolled out of bed. They're all standing at a railing watching something down below. I really need to pee and get dressed so I try to rush past all of them, but my husband is standing with his step brother and his wife (who in reality, we had a big fight with a year ago and don't speak with them and avoid them). The wife turns around as I try to run by down the hall to the bathroom, and of course she is dressed in the most expensive nicest clothing with hair and makeup done. 

I shout that I want a divorce as I run by, and his step brother and his wife laugh (ironic they'd witness this because in reality he caught her cheating and they have not divorced but reconciled). 

I make it to the bathroom, but when I shut the door and turn around there's some long haired guy I don't know at all sitting on the toilet (not going to the bathroom, sitting on the closed lid). He is smoking crack and offers me some. I don't smoke crack! Wtf! I tell him no as he holds a lighter to the glass pipe, and turn to exit the bathroom without having done what I needed to do (this bathroom resembles our own in our real life house). As I open the door the guy starts screaming and the boiling hot glass pipe is stabbed into his eye socket and the flesh around it is bloody and boiling (think nightmare on elm street style gore). Then I notice he had sat it on a towel I left on the counter and it melted the towel and the vanity counter underneath. My dad runs in to see what's going on as I run out.

Then the scene switches and I'm at some fair. I know my 5 year old son is there in the immediate area, but not with me and I'm not worried about that. The ground is mud. There are several circular benches with individual seats facing outward. I sit in one, and now I'm sitting next to my ex fiancee (he cheated on me over 7 years ago, it was a really bad breakup, and he occasionally pops up at random in my dreams).

 We start talking and are friendly. Then the seats rise up. Like the start of a carnival ride. Everyone is surprised. No one knew this was a ride. There are small cows harnessed underneath, like on a pony ride, that spin the circular benches (I guess they just appeared out of the mud?). 

First they spin slowly, but every time another cow to the side moos, they spin very fast momentarily. No one is strapped in. Ex drops his phone in the mud by accident, but now his hands are free to buckle himself so he does. I can't because I'm trying to hold onto my phone, for some reason my Nintendo switch in it's travel case, and something else all while trying to hold on and not fall out of the ride. I eventually accidentally drop my phone and what I think is my Nintendo in the mud and I'm worried about the cows trampling them. I take that opportunity to try to buckle myself because it's getting harder to hold on and I'm afraid I'll get trampled if I fall out. But my buckle is useless. It's broken. It won't buckle. 

Finally the ride starts to slow and descend back down. Then it flips completely upside down. I'm struggling to hold on. My head is inches from the ground and the ride is still spinning but at a slower rate. Mud splashes up into my face and onto my shirt just a little. I put one hand out between my head and the mud.. And the ride finally stops and we can get off. 

I tell my ex that I'm going to find my phone. I do, and it is muddy but ok. His phone is ok too. I don't see my Nintendo, so I tell him I'm going to look for it. 

I go up a ladder and end up in a run down apartment, with lots of weathered white wood everywhere. The walls, the floors, doors, etc. The back is wide open and there's a dark space down below. It looks like a barn for cattle with several long rows separated by fences made of the same weathered white wood. As I look closer, I see my Nintendo down there. It's distinctive blue case. There's a ladder. I kick off my flip flops and start climbing down. As I reach the bottom, an angry horse followed by a small dog are angrily running toward me, and there are hundreds of other angry horses in the other rows running toward me too. They are all black and just appeared out of the darkness. I jump back up to safety on the ladder just in time. 

That's when I realize I've had my Nintendo in my hand the whole time. What I saw was an empty bag I'd been carrying. I decide I don't care about it, and struggle to climb back up the ladder to the apartment. 

I make it to the top, but have to hide from someone who is in there. I slip past them and back out to the muddy fair ground. My ex asks if I found my Nintendo and I just tell him yes. 

Other than a few more jumbled scenes I don't remember, that's about where the dream ends. 

Definitely not my typical dream imagery. 

Can someone interpret this? Sorry for typos and stuff. I'm on mobile.

So I had a dream about a month ago that involved my ex. (Back story: we've been split for 6 years and have both moved on. Have new partners and babies with Said partners) In the dream, I was in a totally unfamiliar place surrounded by people I had never seen before. I was wandering around wondering, ""why am I here? What is this place?"" and then I turned a corner and there was my ex. He reached for me and said, ""We don't have much time."" and then I started to understand why I was there. We proceeded to hold one another and share how much we still care for one another before he received a text from his current partner and mother and he said he had to go. He left. And I just sat in this unfamiliar place until I woke up. Upon waking, I felt that I was summoned or had traveled to an unfamiliar place to meet my ex where no one could find us. You know, kind of like what happens in Eternal Sunshine when Carrey wants to keep his memories; he takes Winslet to a memory where the dream erasers cannot track. Then a few nights ago in a dream I was in a room sitting on a bed and then my ex walked in the room and I was the one that said, ""I know we don't have much time"" and we immediately began heavy petting and having sex. During the lovemaking I was thinking in the dream, ""please don't wake up yet. Just let me have this."" Like I was totally aware I was dreaming (obviously lucid) and carrying out the sexual act and then I woke up after I came. So my question is, has anyone experienced dream jumping or meeting someone in other realms, almost as a secret place? And then being aware of the dream and creating a very life-like reality within the dream?

The craters were speckled with these blue lights. It reminded me of how city lights are sometimes visible in satellite pictures of the earth. I also saw blue streaks of light going around the planet as it rotated. I was surrounded by strangers in my dream, and I kept trying to point out the lights, but they kept telling me it was a myth.

0.0,9neblc,6.0,1.0,"Hello,

I'm hoping to get some insight/interpretation into a creature I saw in my most recent ""worst"" nightmare. I'll do my best to describe it.

I was in a very unusual place in the dream. High ceiling that extended up into darkness, beyond my range of vision. It was like a mirror room in a fun house, but very dark. Something *off* about it and I wanted to get out of it.

There was a sense of urgency to get out because there was something *following* me in the maze. Never right behind me, but at times it was within view and that made it *too close* for comfort.

It looked like a white wolf but stood upright like a human. I didn't get a look at the leg or spine of the creature because it wore white robes. It was at least eight or nine feet tall, and I think there might have been small trails of blood coming out of the eyes. It wasn't like a ""neutral"" wolf face either...it looked scary, there was something horribly wrong about it. I don't know where I got the thought from, but it felt like some kind of deity or force of evil/death to me.

I'm not even sure if it was walking or *gliding*. Perhaps scarier still was that it never *ran* to get me. It moved very slowly. As it drew within a certain range, I could hear piano music, a song that I'd heard while browsing for scary atmospheric music through the YouTube Audio library: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awieHJ7k6EQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awieHJ7k6EQ)

Not even the scariest song I heard while browsing, but since having the dream, it gives me chills.

I had a feeling that if it got close enough to me, something horrible would happen. I don't know what. I can't elaborate it, but it was the most awful feeling whenever it got close enough to me. The dream ended with me stuck at another portion of the maze and the music started to play again, meaning it was drawing close.

Please help me elaborate what all of this means, or offer your opinions on it. Thanks!

EDIT: A few more details. It moved kind of like the chess pieces in the first Harry Potter movie, I think, but *much* slower on average. It was almost inanimate in a sense, stationary in a single pose as it glided around in the maze. There weren't any forms of movement to suggest that it was alive (like a face twitch or change of posture) but I *felt* that it was. Also, the ""walls"" in the maze were opaque. You could see through the walls, but only some of them and only for a certain distance. If you moved too far away, you could no longer see through them.

I also had a really weird feeling that the creature was female, but I can't explain how I knew this either. ",hot,Scariest dream I've had in a while,1.0

I didn't look like real hair something different but I didn't know what, I also thought to myself it was kind of weird that my left foot was normal why did my right foot grow hair. I got up did my normal morning routine but noticed some things were off but continued on, I visited my sister in her room and talked to her about the hair on the bottom of my right foot. When I went to show her a small grape vine was growing out of my big toe and the roots (which i thought was hair earlier) where now much longer and thicker than before. I told her I might have stepped on a seed and maybe it started growing in my foot.

The scenery completed changed I just followed them cause I had no idea where I was going or what happened, then they turned around and asked me to help them find their children I said okay. I assumed we were in the future cause things were more futuristic than modern. We turned into some small theater room with no chairs and I saw two young girls sitting down waiting. The parents said thank-you and walked over to the girls, I suddenly had a weird feeling and thought they were going to rape the little girls so I ran to the mother and father. It was then they started hunching over and turned to look at me they completed changed their face was not human their teeth were long and sharp, their eyes were void of life when I looked into them all I could see was the lust for blood. Rage filled their veins as they were about to jump on the two girls. As all this happened a voice in my head started telling me what everything was and what was happening, it said that these adults feed on children to look more human. I acted quickly grabbed both of their necks in either of my hands pushed them to the floor and started choking them out. They were extremely strong but I was stronger also their nails didn't harm me at all when they tried scratching me. After they laid there dead I turned to the little girls and asked them if they were okay. Once again the voice in my head said ""When children in this world turn 12 and are around violence they start to turn into the creatures you just killed"". Then one of the girls turned into a smaller version of those abominations I just killed, but once again I grabbed her neck and killed her as well. I looked at the last girl and told her to calm down, she walked to me and I asked her""where do you want to go?"" She told me she wanted to see one of my friends I know in real life. I started looking deep in her eyes and saw them change, and before she completely turned I snapped her neck.

When I looked down, I saw my liver fell out from a big wound on my body. Then I shouted to my mom that ""my liver has dropped"". BTW, the color tone in the dream was quite yellowish.

Originally I told her to be discreet, because she slept at my place and I didn't really want my room mates to know yet.  She introduced herself in her shirt and panties, to my embarrassment, but that's what I get, right?

I heard my room mate asking her questions casually.   I definitely lived with Eugene Mirmin, I could hear him in the living room.   He wasn't put out by a strange(the first ever) girl I'd brought home.

Turns out she was a manager, and she wasn't nice to her emoyees.  I hope one of them ...he had a problem walking.   I but him a new shoe.   I remember the glue, I remember the heel...I remember the heel was a high heel...it had a joint.   He graciously accepted it, and was able to work better.

In my latest dream i saw a forgotten pair of scissors slowly inching their way further under the blanket as if someone was pulling them. Reacting on impulse i went to grab them. The entity had a strong grip and after some tug of war i went to try and beat at the unseen sources fingers. I could feel it’s appendages under my grip, it felt solid but when i squeezed to hard they’d vanish. The grip it had on the scissors was still strong but i eventually pulled them free. After i smacked the blankets a few times and felt solid lumps. I yelled at it too but it didn’t reply it never does. Scared and frustrated i left the room I didn’t even try and throw the blankets though i knew I’d find nothing.

But recently I had a vivid nightmare over the weekend after not having them for nearly 10 years. I'm 21 and this nightmare unsettled me and woke me up with a foreboding sense of unease and dread in my stomach. I tried chalking it up to the stresses of me senior year of college, but know it's not that. In my nightmare, I remember being surrounded by barren trees that reminded me of beech trees. I was in a forest with a bunch of other adults and kids from preschool to high school since we were doing some sort of excursion that involved walking through the woods to reach a clearing. For some reason I was left in charge of the preschool kids who had to have been around 4 years old at most and there were at least 8 of them. Because I paired them off by twos so they could have a buddy to walk with.

At some point in my dream, I noticed a little boy in my group was missing and alerted the other adults who called out for him. We couldn't find him. Instead, I remember turning and finding his glasses on the forest floor. I picked them up and everything just went weird? Because it felt like I was out of my body as I watched the forest zoom out and then in again to some random clearing with felled trees and the trunks of them and there was the missing boy. But something was off about him as I remember he turned to me and there was black goop coming from his eyes, nose, and ears. Branches, the same color as the beech trees were growing out of his body and rushing toward me as they tried to attack me. I don't remember how, but I ended up back in the forest like I was shoved back into my own body. His glasses were gone from my hand, but something had unnerved me so much that I rushed the kids through the forest and to the clearing we were supposed to be in.

It was Christmas morning (our normal xmas decorations were everywhere) and I woke up and my lights were flickering, and then shit in my room started to shake/hover a little as if there was a ghost? I got up and went into the living room and there was a big piano (which seemed normal in the dream even though I don't have one or know how to play) but then it started playing on its own and I INSTANTLY had a horrible dread feeling. So I ran into my parents room (even though they don't live here anymore) and my mom was in bed and I told her there was a ghost or something in the house. She got up and was like ""Lol and we have ppl coming over for xmas soon."" like she didn't believe me but she got up and went into the living room. But now there were those gross house centipede bugs everywhere and she said ""Ugh it's just these now i have to clean them up before everyone gets here!"" So she started picking them up with her bare hands, but then huge (about 50-60 lbs dog sized) white termites came out of my room and came into the living room, I ran and she tried to run too but when I looked back one of them had her by the leg. So I grabbed something to smash them with and went to run back and try to kill them to keep them off her but I woke up then.

This one was from last night, and sadly I only remember the main parts and not the details of why/what I was doing?

There were a lot of people over my house and we were all hanging out outside (pretty normal) but somehow I fell/tripped/was pushed (don't remember) and at first it seemed fine, but then my bloody teeth started falling out of my mouth and I felt the pain in my face. I started coughing and spitting them out and I could hear my mom scream and freak out because of it like I had died, then I woke up.

I've done some googling on my own, and termites and spitting out teeth both seem to be bad omens but for what exactly idk? A lot of sources say teeth dreams mean a fear of aging but that really doesn't seem right because I've never been bothered about age in the past.

I went inside and everyone was drinking and laughing. As soon as i entered my head hit a beam from the roof and everyone turned to stare at me. The laughing stopped. No one moved, i was frozen again.

Quite possibly the most powerful and beautiful thing I have ever experienced, I’m in tears as I write this. This is going to be so hard to explain but I’ll do my best. I basically left the complete realm of existence and was seeing from another plane. I was flying in my dream, in a new neighborhood being built, when I noticed the grid lines of the 3rd dimension all around it and it was in a cube encompassing the whole neighborhood. Once I flew out of the cube, I flew into a new plane. This is where it gets confusing. Our earth plane is like a huge ethereal cube, with many many section we flow through during our lives. There are cubes for each and every dimension, and while living in a higher dimension, you either can stay in that cube or have the ability to move between possibly the one below and even more rarely the one above. I watched as my energy flowed out of this ethereal plane of existence into the realm in-between all dimensions. I at first could only see the dimension I came from. It looked like a huge white ethereal cube with letters going through the grid and there were cubes within it that I couldn’t see clearly from outside. I flowed into a part of this cube or plane that we exist on and saw from a higher perspective. I saw angels in the form of nuns working with my roommate and his younger sister who lost their father years ago and are still working through it on a deep level. I didn’t think anything of that until later on when I was thinking about writing this down and telling my roommate and I just thought about how beautiful even our plane of existence is, because angels are there doing energy work, helping out those that experienced emotional trauma and helping them to vibrate at the highest possible level. I’m not sure if I looked in on that work being done in their dream state or if that was just symbolism, but I 100% knew they were angels and they were sent to do energy work with them. I flowed back and fourth into different points in our plane of existence and back into this inter-dimensional space, and was able to see a few different aspects from the viewpoint of maybe how an angel or a soul that hasn’t quite yet returned to earth but is in getting ready to incarnate again would see our plane. Then I noticed how if I put less focus into looking at this cube, it turned into a planet. It was earth, and next to it I saw the moon and a few other planets, all with the white ethereal energy around it but no longer in a large cube. Then I turned myself upside down and looked up though my legs at what was above and behind me. It was like going almost upside down on a swing and looking up through my legs, but just in my spirit body. I saw many dimensions lined up, each with a different cube, each with a different density and vibration. Once I noticed that the closest dimensional cube to me in the other direction, I tried to flow my energy into the fourth dimensional cube. I was fighting a force of energy that was holding me towards the earth plane, but fought against it and tried to see that from a higher beings perspective. I tried flowing into this cube and I wasn’t able to. It was like I was in a video game at level 1 trying to fight a boss at level 50, while also seeing all the other bosses and knowing how far exponentially they were ahead of this one.  Then a voice in the in-between dimensional world said, “You must train in order to reach the state to be able to enter these dimensions from this plane.” Then I saw all the planetary energies get shrunken down, their etheric density remained the same but they shrunk to a size that I could squeeze in my hand. When I squeezed each class planet’s energy in my hand, I felt what the 3rd density life on that planet would be like. I had to meditate while holding the energy of each planet and feel oneness with each planet’s energy. Some were easier to squeeze and understand, others took many tries. After I got tired and could no longer train, I flew back into where I was located in earths etheric cube, saying goodbye to the other dimensions and the plane in between. I woke up vibrating at a crazy level and as soon as I started thinking about what just happened I got the chills and started to cry uncontrollably for a minute or two as I wrote this.",hot,I entered the realm in-between dimensions in my dream,5.0

We both have left our baby in the hospital, and I was the one who brought it/him(?) and deciding that I will become a single mom. A couple of years later in the dream, my “son” was actually a toddler daughter and before I woke up, we seemed to be in a church setting.

I was dreaming about a big old house, like many many leaves, during autumn... it is abbandoned and I don't know of there is anything or anyone living there, but the sensation is something crushing my hearth the entire time.

There is a thing that resembles a cross with a drop falling into it... and every time I remember it, it itches my arm. There is also a kid talking to me, saying that I need to show courage, that sometimes it's easier to stay and fight than to take my own life.

At the end, I see a really huge tree near the house, both the house and the tree seems huge, like they became 10x bigger from the start.

I was in the roof and the kid was saying that he was proud ""I could take my own life"", and I started seeing that cross again, and looking to the abyss that came from nowhere... I feel like there is something behind me and I jump...

The kid starts to say again that I should be proud of taking my own life, It needed courage. And I was trying to disagree while I was having the sensation of fall... I felt all the impact pain, I was still not dead and hoping I would die anytime soon, because I sensed something was coming after me.

Again the kid continues to repeat, a music starts playing and the cross images with the drop...

The music is ""superfantastico balão magico"", I don't know if it's the right name... I woke up screaming and my wife holding me... for the 10th time this week.

A car pulls into the front driveway and 3 sketchy guys get out who look like thugs or mercenaries.  I am nervous but my companions are not interested.  My group is totally visible to these guys, but they don’t notice us at all. They start arming themselves with machine guns and other heavy weapons from their car.  I’m getting really nervous now.

0.0,9m8f5z,1.0,0.0,"TL:DR At the bottom

Two hours ago I woke up, spend 30 minutes lying on bed and contemplating about what the hell I have just been trough. To make it worse, this was actually second time I had this dream (few years back). It was not exactly the same. Same timeline. The thing is, from the first dream I only remember the experience, feelings and ideas, not minute-to-minute events. In second dream I have a feeling that it just flew trough same story as fast as possible, staying in each scene only for so long that I remembered (or re-learned) original message, then it quickly jumps forward. I will talk about second dream, and set you into context with bits from first dream.

It will be hard for me to annotate what I knew during dream, what I knew ""extra"" during that dream (from first run-trouh), and what I know after waking up, but if you know in advance that I will be jumping those three prespectives, it should make more sense. I try to annotate as best as I can. 

I try not to leave out any interesing bits (essentially dump my memory). If I talk about ""closing my eyes and feeling affection"", its not only because it happened, but because its important context wise. I try to explain everything by the end, even if it looks unimportant by the time you read it. Something I dont understand its value yet.

Before I start describing the dream, there are few key facts we should learn about in advance. One could call it **meta info:**

Key Characters: Except me, none of those characters currently exist.
Me, starting at around age 30,
My girlfriend (later wife), similar age,
Our son, is strangely outside of this dream.

Location: Roughly 500m radius area inside my hometown, not far from my actual home (another ~500m from edge of dream action)

Time: in ""near future"" (think now to +5 years?), sunny warm days.

So, the Dream..

Me, gf and some friends are driving in car and discussing next activity to keep us occupied. I suggest there is a film to be watched (I think I was actually reffering to rewatching the old dream, but I am not sure, those things kinda blend) just next street. We agree and head that way. This is where the first dream actually started, I think.

We are on foot, walking by the street. 
From my extra memory (first dream), I know I posses some ""super powers"" (I had those before too, but I dont remember how I aquired them in the first dream. I think I was surprised and explored it before, but now it was like rediscovering what I already knew and ""forgot"") I test this by taking a leap forward which almost transforms into flight. (its very similar of what people usually do in lucid dream, but here I was not in control).
Friends observe, but doesnt find it strange. Its like nothing out of ordinary is happening, as if for them I was only walking. 

We are inside a flat, having a party. gf + 3? ladyfriends talking at a table, me, next room with 2? friends chatting standing near _closed_ window we play golf out of. 
We hit something to go trough window, and while item flies trough and is sitting at a grass outside, window is still unbroken. I analyze that, and its like a trigger for my second superpower, I can ""control time"". The time control isnt like I rewind it, but more like I focus, world starts to pulse strangely for half a second and POP, suddenly the thing we kicked outside is sittin in my hands again. Again, nothing strange for me this second dream, I just dont remember how I learned it my first dream. After I ""found again"" this skill, I have strange urge to go tell my gf about my first power. Not powers, power. I want to tell her about flying, strangely I dont mention time hacking to her at all. I go next door to my gf and ask for her attention to focus on an empty cup of coffe. I then proceed to use telekinetic to lift it (aka flying), and as she follows it, I ""hand over control"" of it to her gently. In a second she is the one controlling it, somewhat amazed of what she is capable of. After I handed the control to her I remember closing my eyes and cuddle my head to her neck, suddenly feeling strange, melancholic affection. I didnt know why yet, it seemed as another random fact. I hear her whisper ""slippery"", as she learns to control the cup. The girls around find the power interesting, but the scene is already fading.

We both had the power/s now. We walk outside, random people around, I notice two disctinct people, though. I knew those are agents. They know about powers. They dont like people using it. I dont think gf knows, but I know from previous dream. Despite this, I am reckless and use the powers in plain sight of everybody to ""jump"" 5 meters forward. (I think it was to provoke same situation as in first dream, convo from agents, in shortest time possible). People dont notice, but agents do. They are not openly hostile, but warn ""us"" and plead ""us"" to stop. No, not us.. Her, my gf. I do the jump, but they talk to her, to not use our powers. She is not using any that moment (right?), but they talk to her. In dream I dont find it strange but after waking up and connecting things I think I understand. Will explain later.

Back to the flat. I feel affection, but she is being distant, eyes locked in random spot, completely in her head. I can feel she is scared of something not currently present, thinking it trough, not returning my affection. 

Now time skips forward. 

There was a scene here, seemingly unfitting (I even forgot about it at start) and after it the story returns to the main dream again. Completely unknown place, unknown location, I am in my 50, no gf/wife, with my son in front of our house (not city, lonely house next to dirt road). A friend drives by and stops for quick chat on the road. He is driving a mocked up ""thing"" he created himself, its his hobby, he have no special powers. Front looks like upside-down table in which he is sitting, behind is half of moped (only motor + 1 wheel), and 2 custom made spiked wheels (for traction in hills). Here the scene ends, I have no idea what it ment or why it was present. Back to ""normal"".

So time is forwarded, in meta-info I know we are married, we have son, but otherwise all is the same. (what is interesting, in this ""normal"" timeline I never see our son, maybe this whole timeline is inb4 the scene above? idk)
What changes is we now use our powers casually. Friends have families, and some have powers too. I was flying (all flying in dream is only slightly above ground, up to two meters) the street and meet 1 flying friend and 1 walking friend. Chat few sec, I fly inside friends house and jokingly take a bite of his pancake from above, then move on (really irelevant, I still think) I get to flat (in slihtly different spot now, like 100m from previous). Its where we live, we are just setting the place up. My wife is holding end of cable and flying trough window out (to connect it somewhere?). As she flies trough, the cable is passing trough window behind her, and as it gets to the end of a cable.....

Here is where sh*t hits the fan. 

The last bit of cable gets stuck in the window. She pulls harder, but it wont let go. I fly myself to the window, grab the cable and pull it to the side (so it can get unstuck), and as I do, she pulls again. The cable jinx out and cuts my hand. 

Now in the dream I already have terrible feeling, because I remember what it means from previous dream. And since I remember it well, it doesnt really play-trough in second dream, so I only can explain what I know it ment, I sadly remember very little ""scenes"". Its quirky, but I sadly cant offer anything better.

My cut hand somehow ment that our son became critically ill instantly. He needed immidiate treatment or he had one week to live, lying in hospital. The thing is, the only way to prevent this is to not get cut. The treatment was unavaible, (I have troubles remembering why. Ill think some more and post in comments). 

My wife and I becomes devastated. I get the idea that since I have my time hacking skills, I can reverse it and make it so cut never happens. I try to do so, arrive slightly sooner to wife passing trough window, grab the cable in advance and steer it away from place it got stuck in before. The cable really runs clear out of window, BUT... But somehow it knows what is supposed to happen, and some magic force grabs the end in open air (already 1 meter from window), and doesnt let go. After 2 sec it pulls the cable back into the window and I use my hands to unstuck it again, getting cut... Another try, I dont come to the room at all, but the moment cable gets stuck and jinxes out few seconds later, a cuts opens up on my hand even tho I am nowhere near the cable. It is just ment to happen, any my powers are useless. In my second dream I only tried this few times to re-learn that I cant fix it no matter what I do, but from previous dream I remember trying over and over and over.



The dread feeling wakes me up in the end, completely puzzled, both first and second dream.

---

Now as I tried to analyze it, I think there is something I missed in a dream. Remember my wife not returning affection? She was thinking about something I had no idea about before. Something made her fear enough to not even think about cuddle time (which might lead to baby, but making baby didnt even crossed my mind during a dream [really it wasnt about sex, only about cuddling and affection]). Also, the agents were talking to her not to use our powers, not me. Even tho they never saw her use it, and I used it in front of them. I think, she also had the power to time hack, and once our son became critically ill, she, in desperate, tried to roll time back before he even got conceived. She was fearing the cuddle because she was thinking how best to prevent the inevitable. I think this big rollback wasnt her first try for sure, as I also tried everything. I am not sure if the chat with agents were before or after this scene.

The golf trough closed window. I think that once I got into situation not physically correct (item flew trough window without breaking it), I had to reverse time to get item back, so it makes sense the window isnt broken. 
Seems the time control have more to it than just ""haha nice, do it again"". Why didnt the glass broke I dont know. I believe it was there for demonstration of how it works, but was important for me to understand it. I think there might be more into it I cant see


I am greatfull for any ideas you might have, or any questions that might shine some light on basically anything. I have some ideas about what the dream miht be about, but I would rather not biased your comments in this way. If you believe I should post it anyway, let me know.

TL:DR: Had a dream I had years ago, in dream I can rollback time but once a critical thing happen, reverting and trying again always leads to same outcome, making this power useless. No matter how many times I try or what I do, the outcomes magically happens anyway. I suspect I am not the only one rollbacking time in my dream, but inside the dream I had no idea.

0.0,9ltbav,0.0,1.0,"I was part of a high school trip that was on a field trip/training trip to a futuristic stadium. It was one of those cross-grade trips where people from grades 10-12 went together and mixed and mingled. I remember some of my colleagues crystal clear: there was this one senior named Lauren that had a British accent and was around 5'5, 135 lbs, with pale skin and long, wavy reddish hair. She was a popular, confident girl in the class, and we got along well but weren't close. Another student was a younger boy, maybe in grade 9, with a buzz cut and a funny, memey vibe. A peak form edgelord who probably plays Fortnight. There were a bunch of other students, but I don't remember any details about them. Mind you, I've never met any of these people irl.

So, we enter the stadium and got together for the 'camp' leader to give us instructions. I looked up to see that the arena was a HUGE dome (think IMAX, but about 4 football fields in diameter), with a simulated sky that was mid-afternoon blue on one side, and midnight on the other. Across from our platform, separated by a large seemingly bottomless pit, was a floating island with a dark purple aura surrounding it, about 50 ft above ground level. I could make out some dead trees poking out from the gray dirt. It reminds me of a Halloween Haunt amusement park attraction, but on steroids. Our side was a small town with small, shabby houses. A cute, peaceful peasant-ville from.

""Alright,"" said the leader, ""you will be randomly separated into two teams. One will be on the 'Dark Side' (there was an actual name for it, but I don't remember), and the other will be the Villagers. The Dark Side's goal will be to go to the town and destroy the town hall. It's at the center of the village, so you'll have to battle through the defending villagers to get there. Villagers, your goal will be to cross the Dark Land and destroy their Nexus."" (The Nexus was kind of like those in League of Legends, if you've ever played it.)

At this point, my recall is kind of fuzzy. What I do remember is feeling nervous about playing the 'bad guy' and stirring up tension between me and my classmates who will be on the opposite side. Since it was in person and more or less IRL, the fighting would be real. We'd be shooting down enemy players with a blown up P90 inspired lazer blaster, or melee-ing them using swords, blunt items, or our good old fists. Survival of the fittest, I guess. We probably signed some kind of 'we're not responsible for any injuries, death, ect.' form by this time. I also remember that the damage would be painful and real, but not fatal. You'd be teleported to the 'base' and treated immediately at 'death'. I was put on the Dark Side team and remember feeling this fluttery excitement.

\*Flash forward.\*

I was teleported to the island and remember leaning against an abandoned barnhouse, making small talk with a classmate. I was issued one of those blasters (we got varying weapons), and was trying to figure out how it worked. The countdown started and a tense atmosphere took over the group. The final second beeped, and the leader announced ""Begin!""

\*Flash forward.\*

Lauren, who was on the Villager side, came across the rift and was engaging in battle with me. We were exchanging shots from our blasters at range, and I somehow sniped her down with a headshot a few seconds in. It was one of those 'big plays' moments and I felt a surge of pride. Immediately after the blast hit, it turned into this glowing lime green goop, covering her head and chest. I was horrified to see what it did to her. She screamed and screamed, and clawed at her head, trying to get it off. She started to rip her hair out, and at that point I decided I couldn't stand it anymore, and turned to run away.

\*Flash forward.\*

I was in this close-range fight with a the 9th grade boy with a buzzcut, who was hiding behind a bush and ambushed me somewhere down a path. I was startled, and started to shoot at him. Embarrassingly, I missed every shot at such the close range. Each miss got me more flustered, and after 3 or 4, I ran out of ammo. The boy pushed me down and started to wrestle me. We rolled around in the dirt, trying to get a power position. He wasn't holding back at all; it seemed like he was enjoying the opportunity to fight a little too much. I started to tire out, but somehow got on top. My relief was short lived, as he kicked me off and flipped me face-to-sky on top of him, locking me into a choke hold from behind. I panicked, grasping his arm with my hands.

As I started to lose consciousness, a classmate came down the road and noticed our altercation. He was on my side, and I motioned desperately for him to come. He ran over and, to my dismay, started making small talk with Buzzcut boy. He said something along the lines of ""Hey man, how are you? You liking this game?"" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I manage to utter ""help me the fuck out."" The boy looked at me and said ""dude, how am I supposed to help you if you suck this much. You're not even trying."" At this point, I was so angry that I used my rage strength to break free, and get on top, putting Buzzcut into a choke hold. Classmate guy must've been a huge asshole, because he did nothing to help his friend. Buzzcut passed out, and his face turned purple.

I got scared. What if he died? Like, die died. It was irrational in that context, since he'd 'respawn at base', but I couldn't help feeling that way. I relaxed my grip to check if he was still breathing. Suddenly, he took a huge gasp and kneed me in the gut. In a mocking voice, he said, ""Pussy, this is what you get for not finishing what you started."" My eyes widened in shock, and I immediately tightened my choke, holding my breath and pushing harder than I've ever pushed in my life. He finally went limp after struggling violently. I let him fall to the ground. His eyes popped forward and his tongue stuck out, slack on the side of his face. I didn't have to check to know he was dead.

\*Flash forward.\*

I don't think I had any major fights for the rest of the game. Eventually, one of my teammates got to the town center and won the game. We filed into lines and were ushered back to the town center. I saw Lauren walking a few rows ahead, and tried my best to stay unnoticed. I was scared and ashamed of what I'd done to her. She seemed to be taking it well, and was talking energetically with her friends. However, I could tell that she was wearing a wig. Her hair was was wavy and stylish, but it was a dark brown instead of her natural red.

We congregated back at the starting point, and replays of the game began streaming. I saw a birds eye view of each team during the countdown. It panned and zoomed through a few different sections, and I noticed myself on-screen. I was wearing tight, dark blue jeans, and a black sweater. All I remember after that is that I was embarrassed that everyone would see my lame missed shots with Buzzcut boy.

 I have this recurring dream where I'm in a shallow pool,in a blank white void(or a blank white room, I can't figure out which). I'm wearing a white button up shirt and white dress pants, or sometimes nothing.  I fall with my back against the pool floor and drown in an endless void of water.(I can actually feel the water on my body, but don't feel like I'm dying when I'm drowning) And then it repeats until I wake up.But usually, I have other dreams after this one, which are the ones I usually don't remember once I wake up. During this dream, I also sometimes see my friends and family in pools like the one I'm in and they fall like me and drown, too.(They are also in separate white empty voids/rooms but I can't see them when they fall into their own separate endless voids of water) (they are also wearing white button up shirts and white dress pants, or sometimes nothing) This happens for a couple of months every other year or so.

My husband and I were driving my friend's girls somewhere. (Previously in the dream my friend, her hubby, and her girls were talking about going to Toys R Us for their Halloween stuff, but it was a far drive to one of only a few stores left). The youngest may have been my daughter on this part.

We got back home and as we're getting out of the car/walking inside, my husband gets a phone call. He answers and I hear a female voice start talking to him. It's his friend/book editor. I hear the start of what she's saying but he walks off to/in the house. (Note: I noticed when we got out of the car that my hubs was only wearing a t-shirt and boxers. Thought it was crazy that he went out with no pants. He'd never do that.)

I'm a little irritated, then hubby comes back over and he's trying to put the phone on speaker mode. He's having trouble getting it to work. Asks his friend if she can hear him after he presses one of the buttons on his phone. No answer.

He asks me if he has any black pants. I notice that he's now wearing a beige patterned polo shirt. I realize he's going over to her house or going out somewhere with her (because why would he specifically ask for black pants) and I'm mad. I also remember thinking that he might have a pair of black slacks in the closet but they're from a few years ago and probably won't fit.

I head upstairs, him following behind, and I'm fuming. I go to a walk-in hall closet, complaining out loud that I wish I had someone who would drop everything to come when I called. I remember there being some notebooks/composition books on the shelf. Don't think I found pants.

I leave the closet and walk thru a parlour type room. There are other people in here... I remember an old woman in a wing back chair, a teen (possibly one of my friend's girls from earlier?), a young boy. I think there may have been others but don't remember.

Then I notice the lights are dimming/flickering. I get more angry that they're acting up/that this house sucks. I will one of the dimming lights to brighten back to normal. It does. 

I don't remember if someone gasped or cried out first or if I turned... But another light behind me, one over a glass case, started brightening too much.

Note about glass case: it was filled with what I think were little glass sculptures. All exactly alike but each one was a different shade of color...they were lined up in rows of those colors... Blues, reds, greens, etc. creating a rainbow pattern.

As the light brightened, I started to get scared but tried to will it to go back to normal. It seemed to work at first, then it brightened even more till it, and possibly the glass case, broke. I remember the scared look on the boy's face... The teen was concerned about the old lady, making sure she wasn't hurt by any glass.

It was then I turned and saw the staircase up to the third floor. It was also then I realized I was in the house from previous nightmares I've had. Coming down the staircase were shadow figures.

I don't remember if I spoke or whispered to my husband...I can't remember if I tried to hold onto him or if I was frozen in fear. But I told him I saw five of them...then as they continued moving down the stairs, I counted six total. They descended the stairs which turned on a landing behind the wall into the hallway we were in by the closet.

Note about the shadow people: they were all black with glowing yellow eyes. One was a girl with big, fluffy pigtails. She skipped down the stairs. The others were boys. I think most were all young...but they may have just been small.

Then I woke up, heart pounding and scared out of my mind. I've been dreaming of this haunted house which occasionally features the shadow people for awhile. I can't remember when these dreams began, but I think it's been less than a year. I rarely see the shadow people or they've been far away/indistinct. In this dream they were very clear and prominent. Up until this dream, I think I've been alone in the house. The second floor of the house usually had the haunted activity, feelings of dread ... The third floor I was always to scared to go to because that's where the ghosts lived.

In most of the haunted house dreams, I'm yelling at the ghost activity to stop, similar to me trying to make the lights work in this most recent dream by trying to use my mind.

I was creek fishing in a common spot in my town down a tiny ravine (a real location), and I turned around and saw a baby fox, curled up sleeping comfortably.  I remember snuggling up with it and touching it gently.  

&#x200B;

Things get blurry here.  Next thing I know I was in a place that was not my actual house, but was my home in the dream.  I had the baby fox in this home.  I also remember something about how there were actually 2 animals (baby foxes), but I don't remember seeing the 2nd at the creek.

The dream clarifies when a very happy and friendly couple shows up (no idea who they were) and tells me that I just found their lost DOG, and it's not a baby fox.  They were very happy to have their dog (dogs?), and I remember being happy for them and the animal.  The end.

While I was asleep I dreamt about being held hostage by a strange figure that would call me ""brother"" in a rather disturbing tone. 
(As if he used to have a real brother, but something happened to him, he also had slaves that he would call ""brother"" in the dream)
I can't clearly remember what kind of place I was in, but escaping the place was an option, but somehow I was worried I was get beaten up or murdered by his henchmen.  Then I woke up for a few minutes and fell asleep again in which I dreamt about having rehearsals for an existing stage play while receiving the news that the director died of a heart attack. I would then be brought home along with the rest of the cast in a van driven by no one other than the director just mentioned. As the dream was happening the setting unconsciously changed and suddenly it was my mum bringing me home in what seemed to be a gigantic house that was able to drive. Instead of the house that I currently live, we arrived at the house we used to live in before we moved. The inside of the house was being demolished. The mailbox was full of letters addressed to me, some from my old part-time job from last year. 

VERY strange dream, I noticed that trying to escape is one of the themes from the dreams. All of this seems very interesting to me and I feel like this dream was trying to tell me something.
Some context I could add is that I was feeling a bit anxious about missing my appointment and that I'm gonna be busy this entire month with various things, leaving me with very little free time for myself.

0.0,9lenkk,0.0,1.0,"Years ago I had a dream about a house. Mainly the upstairs. The upstairs way laid out lile the upstairs of my great grandpartents house. Something always creeped me out about their upstairs when I was a child. As if something were up there, watching me. In the dream the house was inhabited by demons and I can only remember being scared.

Last night I dreamt of this house again, except I was the owner of the home now as an adult. I had closed off the upstairs so that no one could go up there. Some people had come to stay with me or move in with me, and since I didn't have the room for them to stay due to having my own family living there, I hesitantly offered to let them stay upstairs.

I went up the stairs knowing there was something up there, but knowing I had to take care of it in order for the people to stay there safely. So I went up and the stair case was different. It seemed to be outside, as if the house was built around the stair case. It was raining and there was a bucket overflowing with water from all the rain. I came to the first room (4 bedrooms and 1 bathroom) there was a demon laying there and I threw what looked like salt on him. He was in pain and became more and more transparent until he disappeared. I felt like I had to do this before. Like if I didn't do this once every few months or so that they would come back. And the only reason I had stopped was because I was so tired of banishing them. It was easier for me to just never go up there. The same went for the other bedrooms, I never entered the bathroom. 

I came to a huge room, filled with ghosts and demons. I told them that if they could live in peace with us and cause no harm, that I would let them stay. If they refused that I would banish them. The only ones to refuse were the demons. I again threw the salt on them and banished them.

After that, everything seemed harmonious. I was able to interact with the ghosts as if  were friends and belonged there and we could all go upstairs again.

I need my mother's help to load it, but she says she cannot be the one who shoots him (too scared). As he gets close and begins to aim, I aim the gun at him. Explosion (not sure who shot first) and then I wake up. 

Dream 2: Walking down a path with my Girlfriend, we stumble across a woman. I sit down with her and we start talking. Turns out, we have almost everything in common and I think this is just amazing (was not physically attracted to her, just meshed well). After talking for a while, my girlfriend leaves (this seemed insignificant). Seconds later, I hear the scariest wolf howl imaginable. I feel paralyzed and know that I am going to die. Then, I realize that I have to attack first. I'm not going to just lay there. I need to turn around, yell as loud as I can and charge at the wolf. Thinking this reduces all fear; in fact, the thought of attacking the wolf is exhilarating. A primal excitement.

0.0,9l9or3,10.0,2.0,"This is one of the strangest dreams I remember. I still see little sense in it. It has happened years ago, so I may be missing some details now, but it was very vivid. It was from an observer perspective. It started with a scene of looking at a suburban area of an unknown and uninteresting city. There were no people, but an airplane flying in the background. A figure dressed in white - like a ghost - came from right side to the foreground. It plucked the airplane from the sky, which made no sense geometricaly. Then it came closer to me and revealed a big painting, it was a portrait of an unknown old man (but he resembled my grandfather a little), but it had two small square holes in it. The white figure took two square pieces from the ground and fixed them to the holes in the painting using some stick. They did not fit first, but then they magically merged with the rest of the painting and the portrait was whole. Then a huge alien-looking face emegred and replaced the whole scene. It was so big that I only saw eyes and mouth. The eyes resembled the ones sometimes painted on Tibetian buildings. The huge mouth took a breath and then exhaled strongly, blowing away completely everything. For a short while, my existence was reduced to a still consciousness in utterly black void. Then I began to hear a sound like a slow drumming getting louder and louder and simultaneously an image of the grim reaper began to form from the blackness. When it was clear enough it said in a creepy voice: ""I open to the darkness first."" It said exactly this in english which isn't my primary language. Then I woke up completely disoriented like having forgotten that this ordinary reality also exists, not knowing where I am for a moment.

0.0,9lapax,1.0,1.0,"I dreamt I was trapped with my ex in an empty abandoned building. I can’t remember why we were there. We were laying on this floor, but everything around us was exposed. We were scared, but both happy to be with each other and were hugging each other to hold on. We didn’t want to fall off the edges. Somehow the floor turned into a giant mattress and the mattress was falling through the building at a fast speed. We were hugging each other holding on. I imagined that when we hit the ground as we was falling so fast from such a distance, we might die and our legs might brake. I imagined what it might feel like for our legs to snap. I got a bit scared. I also didn’t feel as scared as I should. I felt happy I was with him and I had this feeling that whatever it was we was doing - I was doing it for him. And I was content knowing that. I told myself to imagine a white bright light around the outline of both of our bodies hugging together. I felt this would protect us from dying from the fall.

What does this dream indicate about my feelings??

I recently came out of my relationship with said ex about 4 months ago. It was an almost 3 year relationship and we lived together most of that time. It was extremely abusive in every way. I was very much always in the wrong trying everything to fix myself so he would love me more and I would get things right. I felt at the time I would give my life for him. I would do anything for him. 

I am now completely no contact with him for 4 months and don’t ever plan on talking to/seeing him again. I never got any closure from him. He never wanted to say bye or talk he said what’s the point I know I don’t want to be with you why would I need to talk about it. I’m not sad it ended anymore, I only sometimes get sad about how another human being treated me that way. Maybe I am angry too.

The owner of the truck was trying to brace himself but ended up tumbling back and rolling a little. I turned to look back and he was sitting on his butt, knees bent a little and said: ""oh look at me, I took a tumble"" and laughing. Over and over.

There were people having him but now they were all sitting in pop up lawn chairs, laughing with him. People start calling g for help so I turn around, to face the lake, and they're all sitting on a bench, super casual. The people calling for help are kids, just joking to see what our reaction will be. I try to remember where I parked my car but I can't, then I wake up.

I don't know what happened to the plane.

EDIT: I would like to add that when the I realized a wave was coming, I panicked a little because I didn't want to get caught in it. I knew that if I got caught in it, I may drown because I haven't gone swimming in a while and may not remember how to swim.",hot,Dream of plane falling from sky into lake,1.0
0.0,9kxiko,1.0,1.0,"There’s a spot I keep returning to in my dreams. It’s based on our old house in Nebraska. I think it’s an exaggerated version of a hidden passageway that connected the tiny attic in my closet to the larger attic behind my brother’s closet. The entire flooring was covered in fiberglass, so I could never actually explore this space. 

In my dreams, the secret passageway sometimes leads to hidden rooms. Large furnished areas, with plenty of space to spread out.

No matter what, there’s always a sense of fear. Like my surroundings are haunted, or I shouldn’t be there. 

This most recent time I had this dream, it wasn’t at our Nebraska house. I don’t recall what the venue was supposed to be. I just knew I had been there before.

At one point, a friend mentioned they had to use the restroom. The line was long, so I told her I knew of another one we could use. One caveat: we had to overcome this crazy obstacle first. The way there was dangerous, but I promised her this secret spot would be more than worth it. After dodging arrows, and ducking through a web of ropes, we finally made it to the secret stairwell.

I’ve seen these stairs in my dreams many times before, and they tend to lead to different places. This time, the stairs led to the secret restroom. 

I motion for my friend to head up. But suddenly, I get the feeling we’re not supposed to be there.

When no one is looking, I run up the stairs. But now I’m alone. And it’s a different door. It’s a secret door I’ve never seen before. The guilt of trespassing starts to grow even stronger. But I figured I went through so many obstacles to get there, I might as well at least try to open the door.

It was large and heavy, made of splintered wood and metal finishings. I figured if it’s truly a restricted area, the door would be locked. 

To my surprise, the door opened without any struggle. But before I could see what was inside, I heard someone coming. I quickly closed the door, but no matter how many times I tried, the door wouldn’t remain shut. I didn’t want to get caught, so I quickly abandoned my efforts to shut it. As I walked away, the sound of the door creaking back open was deafening. There was no way to pretend I hadn’t opened it. I nervously stood there as a woman started coming up the staircase. It was obvious I had opened the secret door. I was ready to be berated for being there. But instead, the person assumed I had been granted access to that space.

I woke up to a feeling of relief. The dream had been both incredibly stressful, yet somewhat satisfying, as if I was proud of my dream self for opening that door and getting away with it. 

What’s behind that door? Was it an invitation to come back? Or did I leave it open, allowing something malicious to escape?

[Edit for context:]

There are three main things weighing on my mind recently. 

1) The desire to advance in my career
2) A complicated relationship I share with an ex
3) I’m a survivor of a violent sexual assault, and ever since the police knowingly botched my case, I’ve been a vocal advocate for fixing a broken system. The recent news cycle has made a lot of unpleasant memories resurface. Not about my most recent assault, but one that happened when I was in college. No matter how much I speak about the topic in public, I have a hard time coming to terms with what happened. ",hot,Recurring secret passageway / staircase / door,1.0

Just after that, I wake up, breathing loudly because it terrorised me. I have had dreams like that in the past, but never they were so frightening and reccuring, but they are now stuck in my head and I am scared to sleep at night because of them.

There is a thick, messy blue binder of information left behind by priest. I see this binder twice. Once the priest is talking to a woman while writing things in and looking through the binder. I see it again while walking out of a wooded concrete path in a low income suburb, there is a sort of shaggy grass lawn immediately outside the woods and the binder is just sitting there. It is morning and the grass is wet with dew. I'm walking down the path and come close to picking it up and going through it, but something makes me decide not to. Immediately as I'm walking away from it an old pickup truck pulls up by the binder and the priest gets out, grabs the binder without looking around, and drives off.

I'm following a man through ancient mountain/valley/canyon ruins, the man reaches the lowest point of path we are on and i witness him being eaten by panthers. I do not know the path's origins, but i know they hold great significance. It is daylight, i think early morning. A slight overcast, it's cool, but not misty. The man is far ahead of me, he is not aware I'm following him, he's not even looking around to see if anyone is. The path is extremely long, and starts at a very high point in the mountain, it is mostly bare at its high parts, with a few pillars being the exception. At a mid point the path becomes more of a structure, a wall with battlements, overlooking a valley where the path continues. The lower path in the valley is almost like a street, it's very straight but the other side is a cliff rise. I am on the upper part on one if the battlements.  The man is down in the valley. He his attacked by four black panthers. I see brief flashes where he is a leopard fighting them off, but he is killed. There is a vague sense that the time is different than in my waking hours. It is a different period, that i am not from. It feels like I'm witnessing something very important that happened long ago.

I'm working at my store I work at in real life. The store is dark and empty except for the front by the registers. The store seems to be in a more remote location than in reality. A friend comes through line, asks how I haven't been fired after what happened, she doesn't say what happened, but I know what she's ralking about in the dream, but not now. I suddenly come to the realization that it is 8PM, but it should be 9 because there was a time change. It is dark outside, there almost seems like there is nothing out there, it is not pitch black, i can see through it, but it's like there's nothing to see. I remember a parking lot, a large one. with the same layout as the real store, but there are no other stores or buildings around it. The parking lot is all i see, and there are no cars. 

I'm not sure what order the first two came in, but I know the third one was last.

Last night, I dreamt the BFF and I were back in my apartment sitting on the couch, having a lengthy discussion about his feelings for me and how to proceed in our friendship. During the entire conversation, we held hands. I think I kissed the inside of his palm in the dream, but that was the only physical thing I remember occurring in the dream itself.

In reality, my S/O and I have been together for about 9 years, and I have been friends with his BFF for just as long.

0.0,9ks8hv,6.0,1.0,"Like many people I've had many bad dreams before. But I've never had a dream this real before. I could hear myself think in the dream, I could hear sounds and almost feel for lack of a better word. 

I had a dream of a riot breaking out. I wasn’t sure where I was in this dream but it was a suburban backstreet in a subdivision not a major road. Me and who I believe was my dad (he was wearing a suit and tie like my dad) had come out of a house on to a street. The street we were on was U-shaped with two exist leading on to a long street that was a typical rectangular road.
 It was early evening probably about 6 o clock. The houses were very spread out on decent size lots almost all the houses were two story. Based on the trees I remember seeing the dream looked to be up north somewhere. 

I was watching probably from about 100 feet away standing in the front yard of a suburban house, along with a few other people. On the recentagular street a group of people were boarding a bus, an old yellow school bus. The people were mixed in age from young to old people. It looked like many families were on board the bus. The bus was on the left side of the recentagle street parked in the middle of the road. 

From the distance another group marching should up from the far left side of the street with picket signs, bricks, backyard torches, etc. The “protestors” charged at the bus and began rocking it and smashing the glass. I could here the glass smashing and eventually the protestors tipped the bus. The thud the bus made when it fell on its side was loud! I could feel it in my chest in the dream. I can't even discribe how loud it was but it was a very loud thud sound and the feeling in my chest was the feeling you get when you hear a very low bass noise or like a very loud hood slamming. It lasted for a good five seconds.

 After tipping the bus the protesters left and the rioting stopped. 
The police were called and police and ambulances quickly arrived on the scene. I remember walking toward the scene of the bus.  The police were blocking off the scene so I went to the right side of the rectangle street which lead to more suburban houses. A family was in the yard of one of the houses and the wife and kids were crying. I heard the husband say this will lead to World War 3. I kept walking past other houses and other people were saying the same thing and I found myself thinking and saying the same thing in the dream this will lead to World War 3. Other people expressed similar thoughts “They will now attack in retaliation when this hits the news.” ""Bombs are going to be dropping because of this."" ""How can people be so stupid this will lead to war."" That's all I kept hearing from the people in their yards. I found myself thinking the same things, I could hear myself thinking in the dream which I don't think I have ever had happen before in my life.

I entered one of the houses on the left side street and as did a the guy who I believe was my dad that was following. The interior of the house was completely empty and it looked and smelled freshly built (you know that fresh carpet smell, I could smell that in my dream). My dad? said he needed to retrieve his manuscript. I turned on the kitchen light and in the empty kitchen he opened the center island drawer and pulled out a bunch of paper with something printed on it and a thumb drive. He flipped through the pages and put them on the counter, pulled out reading glasses and was reading through them. I told him we should ""get the fuck out of here before something else happens."" and he said in a minute.
My alarm then went off and I woke up.


I never had a dream this real or vibrant before in my life. I've been up since 7:30 and I can't get over how real this dream seem. Especially the sounds, the things I felt in the dream and the fact that I could think in the dream. It was very surreal and strange.

I kept trying to hide a bag of weed in my bra because I felt there were undercover FBI agents everywhere. (Sidenote, I'm in recovery and haven't smoked weed in a long time, so I definitely don't keep weed in my bra. 😂) 

It didn't matter how hard I tried to hide this weed... I just couldn't because the bag made one boob look gigantic compared to the other. 
I turn around to go to the bathroom and the landscape changed and buildings that don't belong appear.  I walk into the first building and a woman tells me how obvious the bag is, so I put it in my underwear. 
I walk outside and hear a female agent telling another agent that she is going to find my drugs because she knows I have them... i continue around the building and sit down at a picnic table. 

A tribe appears in front of me. They were wearing animal skins and each had different war paint on.
They were chanting and dancing. I couldn't understand what they were saying, so I asked ""What does this mean?""
The chief  (I think) puts his hand over my eyes to close them. I felt my heart racing and a roar came from my stomach. With eyes closed, I could see a lioness that began roaring with me. I felt like I was chasing an animal, but as I opened my eyes I was still sitting and looking at the tribe. 
I finally understood their chanting as if they were speaking English.
""Eyes. Mind. Heart. Soul. All is one. All is connected.""

0.0,9knss1,1.0,2.0," I have had many dreams in the past about exploring mountains, usually  climbing uphill inside a col. Actually, as I think about it more, the  col is typically the drawing force of the mountain. These cols (I wish  there were more names for this feature because I'm sounding repetitive)  typically have rivers, wildlife, forests, and other beautiful features.  Mystery surrounds them and I MUST discover every secret it holds. I'll  travel long distances by car, foot, or bike; I'll brave whatever dangers  might come between me and the col.  


Whenever there, the sun is  shining bright, other people are exploring the area, etc. And to make it  clear, these cols are huge, expansive structures that are not flat -  they are close to 45 degree slope up the mountain. Another feature of  these cols are that they are not near the bottom and not near the top,  they are ""lost"" on the mountain side, often hidden in the folds of the  mountains. They almost always house a forest which obscures all the  hidden secrets to be found.  


Sometimes there are holy places here  (once a temple of white, another time it was white rocks that make a  Romanesque open-air theater). I love standing on the holy ground but I  must travel far to get there. Even when I do, they are still shrouded in  total mystery to me and I do everything to learn from asking other  travels to reading monument plaques.  


I always wake up unsatisfied  because, as a human, it's impossible to explore the whole vast area. I  would need to return time and again just to see everything once, it  would take far more trips than that to start to learn about the tranquil  landmarks and all their significance.

Could this have meant something? Or  could it just have been caused by me reading the chapter in Half Blood  prince where Toms mother died in a woman's arms. I feel like it might  have meant more. Could events in my life have created this dream? I just  started college this year, found out one of my close friends  emotionally abused several other people and was a borderline sexual  predator, and also ended up growing distant from one of my few other  close friends. I'd had a crush on her for the longest time, but at the  same time I also felt a platonic bond with her. However, her handling of  relationships was careless, and frankly cruel. She never bothered  responding to texts, never bothered trying to start conversations, never  bothered to be vulnerable in anyway or even as much as show that she  trusts someone, even when that person showed trust to her. And yet she'd  still pretend to be all of her friends friend. (She does this to  seemingly everyone she knows) I just sort of quit bothering with her,  and seeing if she would react to close the gap I created. Apparently she  is one of those self centered people who doesn't care, but isn't brave  enough to tell the people around her. (Which wouldn't bother me at all,  it's the emotional confusion that does) After all of this, I haven't  felt sad or hurt. I just felt totally empty. I suppose that has to do  with the romantic feelings disappearing, and whilst I don't think they  would have helped me at all, I hate the empty feeling they left behind.  It's as if the aura of my romantic feelings was acting as a mask to hide  how empty I feel in life. And the fact that I now have a grant total of  one close friend who I can readily and regularly meet doesn't help.  Sorry for the therapy session, just thought it might help.

0.0,9kjrrb,5.0,3.0,"A little backstory: I'm 24 years old, living in America, and I've been questioning my gender expression for the past ten or so years. I say this because my dream does dive into a bit of gender issues which may affect what it could mean. Also, these are just the details I remember. I had this dream on Friday night and have only typed it out today. 

So it started out that I was a young woman working in an stereotypical cubical style office. I knew I wasn't ""me"", like I was viewing this from a character's or another person's point of view because I wasn't myself. I was someone else. This young woman had thick black hair down to her waist, bangs just above her eyes. She wore two braids on either side of her bangs that were connected in the back to keep her hair out of her face, and from what I could tell from the few times I/she passed a mirror, she was either fully Japanese or half Japanese. Her job was to investigate and write reports on what people claimed to be supernatural occurrences. Most of the things she investigated were hoaxes and so she became known very quickly for her ability to ""sniff"" out the hoaxes. If the editors of the journal she wrote for had a suspicion about a claim, she got the first choice to investigate it. There was this claim that a door in a warehouse could lead you to a realm of puzzles where you would either face the worst parts of your self and win, becoming a better person, or you would lose and your demons would escape the realm in your body. There were three teenagers crowding around the door when she came to investigate, a nerdy boy and two bookish but model-like girls. 

 The teenagers refused to be scared away and actually tagged along as the woman opened the door. There was a dark room with a bare light bulb in front of a dirty mirror. She approached the mirror and pulled the string to turn on the light bulb. Instead of lighting the room immediately, the string instead closed the door behind the four of them, leaving them in complete darkness for several minutes before the light slowly flickered on. In the mirror stood the three teenagers, but instead of the woman, there was a young man. Same age, similar features, but completely male. The young woman looked down and saw that she was now male. This was what the realm interpreted them as. (At this point, my view of this character or person did shift to the they/them pronouns inside the dream too). They saw that a door knob was painted onto the surface of the mirror and they pulled the mirror away from the wall to reveal a long, dark, damp hallway with a pristine wood door on the other side. Together, the four climbed into the hole behind the mirror and approached the door. 

 From here, my memory of the dream gets a little hazy. There was sequence of five puzzles, some riddles, and I think at one point a trivia game. All the time, me/the person was always placed in front of a mirror to solve the challenge. Each puzzle, a figure behind them seemed to grow closer and closer. The last door opened to what appeared to be a meadow with a large oak tree with birds, but as they stepped onto the grass, the group realized the place was made of living paper. The grass, the birds, the flowers, even the tree was all made from carefully woven strips of paper. Each strip of paper had a different word written on it. Some in English, but most were written in every language that had written words. Sitting on the limb of the oak was the figure from the mirrors. It looked like the young woman did in the real world, but in an exaggerated state of feminine beauty. Her hair had a subtle wave with one or two strips of red in the black. Her eyes were now blue instead of brown. Her lips blood red. Where before she had had a delicate but simple hourglass frame, this creature had an extreme hourglass that put emphasis on any area that could be conceived as sexual. I/They froze as the creature jumped from the tree and landed without disturbing a single blade of the paper grass. 

From there the dream departed into three different endings. All started at the point where the creature jumped from the tree. The first ending, the creature led them to a screen with a keyboard underneath. On the screen there was a place for twelve words to be put in as passwords. At first they just entered words that I associate with anxiety, stress, and dysphoria. Things like ""shame"", ""disgust"", and dangerous things like ""cutting"". Once all twelve words were in. Their body tore to shreds of paper and the creature screamed as the teenagers were able to escape.   The second ending started when I fell back to sleep after getting up for a few minutes. Instead they used words to describe the creature from terrifying to beautiful, the last one being ""me"". A door opened and the group was able to escape as the creature collapsed into a roll of paper.   The final ending. They refused to put any words in. They ignored the screen, the keypad. They said that if they escaped, more would come to this place because they would write about it. This angered the creature and she tore the male body open and ripped out the young woman before climbing inside. The woman died as soon as she hit the paper grass and I became the creature in the male body.  I wasn't the creature. I was me. I plucked a paper leaf from the tree and read it, taking every English paper I could find. The two girls from the teenager group fainted as I walked around in skin that was and wasn't mine. Only the boy followed me around, trying to make sense of what I was doing. 

Finally I realized that each piece of paper had the words ""follow me"" written on them. In every language, the words were the same. So I ran to the keypad and entered ""follow"", then ""me"" and so on until every row read ""follow me"". The door open, and the boy and I stepped into the world. And I was the young woman, but I was also the young man, and I was also the creature, and I was also me. And the teenage boy was now a black cat with a red ribbon as a collar.

Ive had multiple dreams where it’s dark and then I get scared and run to a light and turn it on, but the lights dont on and then I get freaked the f out and start turning it on and off really fast. This happens so much that now I usually reaize in my dream oh shit this again... and then I’m still scared but Ibrealize okay I’m probably dreaming so then I close my eyes or try to just think everythings okay I’m just dreaming, and then sometimes I’ll wake up, but other times I’ll wake up, but I’ll still be dreaming, and it’s like I wake up in my bed thinking I woke up from my dream, but it’s like I start another dream, sometimes more than once until I acually wake up.
Also, this most recent one after the light switch thig, I closed my eyes in the dream and heard a little kids voice taking to me when all I was dreaming was darkness because my eyes were closed and I got freaked and kept thinking okay it’s only a dream, and then i kinda forget but there was more.
I might have just kept sitting there listening to the voice in the darkness or maybe I thought I woke up but kept my eyes closed because I didn’t know if I actually woke up or if it was another one of those where I think I wake up bit am still dreaming, so I was in this state scared thinking okay I might have woken up, but I don’t know for sure so I kept my eyes closed and then like right after I heard the voice again and the kid was okay, okay let’s do this again or something like and I was scared and didn’t want to, so I kept my eyes closed and eventually woke up by thinking about reality more while dreaming until I woke for real because I was scared if I opened my eyes I would see scary things like people watching me in the dark sleeping or something like that.

When we finished eating, we went into the house and somehow we walked into a large area with a large square hole in the ground. The opening of the hole was about half an American football field (50 yards) in size. On the sides of the hole, there were narrow stairs just going down along the sides in an angular and linear fashion. I started walking the steps down and as I got deeper, the stairs started having multiple paths and some did not go along the sides. They went towards the middle of the hole where you can't lean on the wall and you could fall. It was also harder to see. As I went down, I saw other people just giving up and diving into the hole and there were others who would scream in fear when someone would dive in.

I know in my dream that I’m cheating, but it doesn’t register in my mind that the guy I’m cheating with is a guy that is exactly like my boyfriend until I wake up. It’s really confusing. In my dream I always try to convince myself that it isn’t cheating, that’s its only physical stuff and it doesn’t count because I don’t care about the person I’m cheating with and I love my actual boyfriend so much (which doesn’t make sense because they’re literally the same).

The guy that supposedly was my dad had a slat circle around me. They couldn't attack me because of that. They had my parents name but looks nothing like them and they didn't act like them. The ground started to shake so did the walls. The men or whatever they were stabbed, the fake parents. I wanted to feel bad but I didn't. I felt some sort of relief. The fake dad was abusive and the fake mom just let it all happen. I only saw him get stabbed not her ..I passed out before I saw the rest. after that, It time skipped me taking the popcorn off the ceiling, This weird woman that told me, I'm going be okay during the attack then left. Was ""friends"" with my grandparents she was saying she could take me off there hands and that what they wanted so they gave her custody of me. She took to me to this place in las vegas. It was like a weird tiny mall\ Academy place. But there was no learning at all there. Almost everyone looked strange with weird eyes but some look normal. Hell, some had normal jobs outside, The normal looking ones could leave sometimes. Some were models, Artist and actors/es. She was nice kinda, She bought me a care package from one of the stores and showed me to my room. It was nice and homey even had a balcony. After I drop off my stuff in the room she took me to the big area. I don't know how to explain it like the size of a mall food court but was like a hanging out spot like a man cave or something. I met some of the other and that were I found out some of them were models or actors. There was this main guy name time, He had black hair kinda greasy and kinda red eyes. It didn't look fake like if red-eye were natural. He was nice tho. After that, I went to explore the place it had this area. Two of the girls from my school were playing in the band area ..This one girl stop playing and went up to me saying she glad I made it here. The room was so goddam loud I left and went outside ..I felt warm outside and went back to the main building. The lady that I still don't know how to spell her name, The one that took me here was saying that she taking me and 3 other teens to the inner area...There were people that put their family ashes in the middle of the table and would eat with there loved ones...there was this one table that had the picture of them and the ashes but no one was there ...she said were eating at that table since she felt bad for them. When we were eating time gave me this origami bird randomly. I met this girl name and who looks like a fucking Adam family member and the other guy name Isaiah who was albino. I open the bird under the table and it said for me to meet them at the ballroom area around 3 am they had to tell me something. I remember everything we talk about during dinner and that the lady kinda hated tim..After dinner the dream kinda time skip to 3am..I wasn't allowed to have a phone since I was new I gusse.

Ever since we moved, I’ve had a recurring dream maybe once a month or two, where we’ll discover a new, previously unknown room in the house. Upon discovering it, I’m very happy and figured it solved all my problems (in my dream it would either serve as a child’s bedroom or gave us room to knock down walls and make existing space bigger).

The room is always the same. A large bay window with old dusty dark green (velour/velvet?) curtains, a random chaise lounge and maybe some kind of chest of drawers or other old, heavy, dark furniture. Definitely had a “this is an extra family room/den” feel to it. If any of you have been to an historical house in New England, where nothing is level and the floors creak, had that feel to it, which is it what the rest of my house is like.

With that out of the way, I need a little background. My brother has chronic fatigue and he, and my other brother are always on the xbox and often fighting with my parents. Especially my eldest brother, the one with chronic fatigue. I feel like everything has to be altered for everyone but me - we can't get a pet because my dad doesn't want to, I can't have sleepovers because my brothers don't want to hear us, I can't go out with my family because my eldest brother isn't able to. And that's fine, it's just the way it is. I'll be sending a snapchat video to friends, and they'll often talk about my brother's shouting. It isn't abusive, however sometimes it's close to crossing the line. They're just loud I guess. And when they're not yelling at my mum, it's at their friends on the xBox. It makes me feel horrible. But again, I swear on my life it's not truly abusive. Sometimes, my brothers will say something nasty to my mum - who might I mention, has a husband; my father, but is always the one getting attacked. I try to stand up for her, but I'm called a suck up. They yell at her for her asking them to do their chores, get off the xBox, stop being rude, etc.

I'm just walking around in my room, and I pull out my phone - which is something I've never seen in a dream before, and I text my favourite youtuber (gross, I know) ""hey, like j?"" No idea what it means, but that's what I sent. Straight away they call me, ""Hey omg are you okay? You sound really depressed!"" and questions like that on repeat. I would answer, on loop as well, ""Haha, I'm fine, I'm fine! No, I'm fine, really"". I hung up, thrilled they called me. But in the background, whilst I was saying ""I'm fine,"" my family where screaming at each other in the background. And after the thrill had left, I said ""I'm not fine,"" and woke up. I've been really down recently, but this dream was so weird and out of the blue. I guess, I know I'm not fine - I just don't know why, really.

I'm Asian if that helps and a Leo if that's useful too. 

So I had this dream where we were on a school trip to go skydiving. My class and I boarded a bus from school and soon we're on our way to the place. I can't remember if I was sipping on something the whole way there or something, but I knew that my friends and I had to go to the toilet once we arrived.

So the bus stops, my friends and I alight and made our way to the building (bus had to stop like 50M (164ft) from the actual entrance of the building because there was no cul de sac or roundabout for the bus to exit safely after letting us off the bus so the driver made us walk the rest of the way there from a main road, no traffic on it now that I think of it)

We got into the building and there's a toilet near the entrance, it was visibly busy from the outside so my friend, who happened to have been to the place before, showed the rest of the clique another toilet somewhere nearer to the back. And we went.

Got to the toilet and the 5 of us all went to pee, some went to the cubicles while I and some other friends went to the urinals (you know, bro code not peeing right next to each other unless it's extremely busy)

So anyway, I unzip and go right down to business. 

30 seconds pass, the friend who's two urinals away now finish so he goes to wash his hands.

45 seconds, one of my other friends in the cubicles come out to wash his hands.

One minute pass, another friend exits his cubicle, followed by my other friend who was in the last cubicle at around the 1 minute 25 second mark.

I'm still peeing.

2 minutes, friends are getting impatient. But they're still standing around the sinks after washing and drying their hands, all giving me weird looks, no eye contact was made, I just felt like they were staring daggers at me.

3 damn minutes. One of my friends stand like a couple of meters behind me to check if I was still peeing, surprise surprise, yes I was.

People start coming in, suddenly the toilet gets busy. This includes some of my classmates and for some reason my co-worker from my part time job (I should say ex-co worker because I have recently been transferred to another outlet closer to my house).

People come in, do their stuff and leave. Except for my classmates and the co-worker, pretty much all the guys in my class are watching me piss now after one of my friends tell them ""He's been pissing for 4 and a half minutes""

5 minutes now.

Same friend stands behind me with his hands on his hips and says 

""Dude, you've been pissing for the longest time I've seen, literally no one has pissed this long before""

""Must be a world record"" another friend says, along with laughter among them.

""Guys, I really don't know, what's going on here?"" I say to them.

""We don't know either, if you're not done pissing in like a minute, we're leaving to get help"" friend with hand on his hips says, gesturing to the door.

""Well then give it a minute"" I replied, now trying to force pee quickly. The flow/stream (dude honestly wtf never thought I'll be describing the flow of piss in a dream, but anyway) increases.

I get impatient too, and I recall some people unbuckling their belts when they piss, ""Maybe that helps?"" I thought to myself.

So I did that, I wear one of those 'easy on easy off' belts that use a track with teeth and a locking mechanism, (Google 'Anson belt and buckle') so I get it off quite easily. The moment I do this, the pee stream increases and then stops completely after pushing hard for 2 seconds or so.

If it might be useful, the colour of the stream was yellowish, almost unhealthy yellow when I was unzipped, and when I unbuckled it became transparent, almost only slightly pee coloured.

When they finally stop hearing the sound of pee hitting porcelain, followed by the sound of me zipping up, my classmates cheered. Literally like world cup last minute winning goal cheer.

I just quietly say thanks sarcastically and wash my hands before leaving the toilet.

Woke up right after that.

And no I didn't pee in real life, which was a relief.


TL;DR: Went to pee in a not so busy toilet with my friends after a long bus ride, ended up peeing longer than 5 minutes to the point that the toilet becomes busy with my classmates and most of them watched me pee to see the end of it happen. When it does, they all cheer. (I really recommend you reading it, it's really weird)

so i'm at my house, and then my younger sister (who is 11) starts saying something about killing herself, cause of some religion thing? (i'm an atheist and so is the rest of my family.)

So i say (not real name) JEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING? she starts talking about how she sinned or something i can barely remember.

So I called my mom and she rushes back to the house, and she says ""JEN WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?""

And i tell her. (i did research on it somehow?) ""well apparently she sinned."" and my mom looks at me.

""Okay so what's the problem?"" and she starts going on about our religion. And then somehow our religions switch? to a different religion? and then she says something about the new one, and she talks about this creepy guy? And then she just leaves.

So then jen stopped trying to kill herself, and then the creepy guy showed up. (a leprechaun in a golf cart."" and we walk outside. He grabs my other sister (jen's twin sister.) and says ""You have to come save her, she'll stay here for 6 ??? and 1 period! then i'll come for you!"" so then my mom showed up again and says ""better go get her"" or something like that.

so then me and jen started running towards the cart. we ran for a while, we got to a street and i thought in my head, ""wouldn't killing ourselves be the best option? it's better than what's happening to my sister."" and i yell.

As I enter the circle the sky goes pitch black - not in a stormy way, just like the rest of the world was being shut out. The shrouded man who called me over asks to see my palm. He grabs my wrist at which point I feel a shock in that hand. With his other hand, he reaches behind himself, grabs a beam of blue light, seemingly out of the sky, and brings it toward my palm. It snaps into place and I immediately see before me a large group of people, completely black figures backlit by the same electric blue in the beam. 


In the middle of the circle on the ground are the numbers 1 through 6 arranged in a circle. The man instructs me, “Pass your hand over the numbers”. As my hand moves over the numbers I feel a burning sensation. I look at my palm and see a string of characters from an alphabet I don’t recognize. The group of people around the circle seems pleased and announce that this represents the number 6. The characters on my palm turn into a glowing red mandala with a bird in the center.

Then i woke up. 

2. I had a dream that i move out of my BF’s home and had a place to myself.

You tricked me!” I was so caught in the middle, and had the same feeling of being ashamed and angry, and panicky.

Just a huge expanse of whiteness.  Then we notice a door along the wall to our right, so we walk over, and my mom, my sister, and I walk inside.  Dad is left outside, but can see us through a glass window.  Mom's holding me in one arm, and holding my sisters hand with the other.   Inside the room is a complex machine with conveyor belts that sucks people into it and dismembers them, bloodlessly.  Mom, my sister, and I all start screaming in horror as dad bangs on the window, yelling, I think trying to get in.  My sister gets sucked into the machine while my mom and I are still standing there, frozen in terror, screaming.  Then I woke up.

The vision of my sister in this machine, screaming and crying, while a knife hacks (again bloodlessly) off her left nipple is what haunts me the most. 

Context:  My family and I were visiting my maternal grandparents house on an island off the coast of Seattle.  My sister and I were sleeping on the floor of one room, and my parents were sleeping in a bed in another room.  I woke up after the dream and went into their room to sleep with them.  

Afterwards:  We grew up very baptist/borderline full fundamentalist christian.  Immediately after and for years after the dream, I refused to tell anyone about it due to a very real fear/dread/terror that if I told anyone, the dream would come true.  I somehow equated my experience to that of the old testament prophets whose dreams would foresee the future.  In any case, we never went back to our maternal grandparents house, ever.  We became essentially estranged from that whole side of the family for my entire childhood, and it was only after my siblings and I had grown and moved out of the house that my mom began to build a relationship with her parents again.   For what it's worth, neither of my parents seemed to greatly value maintaining relationships with their extended families.  We were close to my paternal grandparents, but not my dad's brother, his family, or any other extended family on either side.  

Any ideas for what the dream could mean?  I'm completely baffled, and any googling has led to nothing.  Happy to answer any questions asked!

Hopefully by this time next year I’ll be moving 700 miles north to Humboldt State to continue my education. After that, I don’t know what I’m doing beyond looking for a grad school to attend.

My dream starts off with me in a stadium, I don’t know exactly what I’m attending because they are still setting up but it looks like a concert because there is a stage in the middle. I’m there with two people I don’t know outside of the dream, a guy of no significance and another guy who kind of resembles the Slenderman, but that’s not who he is, he’s just a really tall, lanky guy. My memory is already pretty hazy about most events (despite only being awake for a half hour now) but I remember the first half or so of the dream us just us walking to our seats, while we’re there I get s phone call so I walk to this room behind our section to take it and hear a broken up voice say “Massachusetts” before the line goes dead, and then another phone call from the same number saying it again. My dream friends come back to ask what happened and I tell them it was a dropped call, so we start to head back out but I get another call, and this continues on for a while until I can piece together that the caller wants me to go to Massachusetts (Connecticut is also mentioned, but I can’t figure out why). These phone calls keep coming but they tell me I should just turn my phone off because it’s probsbly a weird prank, but I tell them I feel like I know who it is because I can recognize the voice. Eventually the caller manages to say my name and I immediately recognize it as my grandmother, who died when I was 13. I freak out a little bit and tell them who it is, so they figure it’s just that I have a bad signal where I am and they go back to our seats. The phone calls come in a few more times and I’m able to piece together that she retired in Massachusetts and wants me to go visit her (this isn’t what actually happened, she retired here in California and died at home) and then the calls stop coming in. This next part feels entirely unrelated but it’s the reason I mentioned that one of my dream friends looked like slenderman, a figure that looks exactly like my friend suddenly comes rushing in from the stairs that lead up to the room I’m in and runs through back and forth a couple times before I wake up with a jolt.",top,Dead Grandmother Wants Me to Move to Massachusetts,4.0

I can't lucid dream either, to me every dream is real as it's happening, no matter how inconceivable.

Somewhere over the last 3 years or so, there has started to be a secret room in all my dreams. It was sparse at first but now it has become a constant fixture of my dreams. 

Despite my inability to know I'm dreaming, I've come to expect and seek out the secret room every time.

No matter how different the dream, the location, If building or structure is involved, so is the room. It's usually behind a small inconspicuous cupbard door. It usually opens to a tube, chute thing that leads to the room.

The room hasn't always been the same when I get to it, and I often don't make it to the room before waking up. Many times I just find the entrance. The first time it was a small library, other times bare to nothing. I feel like I haven't been remembering the room itself for a while, just finding it over and over.

Most times I can remember my dream being of me being in a room that slowly fills up with water and I wake up as I drown. For reference, when I was 4 I almost drowned in a river.

But last night, my dream was different.

I was lying on a couch in an apartment that wasn't mine, watching TV. The TV was a small tube TV. I specifically remember thinking that the TV was small. But I was just watching white noise, for what seemed like a long while, then the screen went black. My girlfriend walked across the screen, turned, and smiled at me, then the screen went back to white noise. I immediately felt sad, but just sad at myself.

Then I looked down at the opposite end of the couch and standing, looking up at me was a baby/toddler. It was holding a white kitten.

The entire time while the dream was going on. As for the dream. I don't even understand it. Basically there were loads of little personalities all controlled by me, and they existed in a realm separate from this one. Like, I could watch what's happening in our world. But it's like it was being watched through a warped window of sorts. The personalities were shapes. And the longer they existed the bigger they became. You start off as a square.

The whole thing starts out in the blackness of space. I'm not in my own physical body, I'm just an observer without any sort of physical form. I'm only able to see and hear.

My view slowly pans to the view of the planet Jupiter, it's almost as if I was in a high orbit looking down upon the gas giant. I can hear a soft, whistling wind and I feel cold. It's very, very eerie. After a few moments of this, I can hear the faint sound of a young girls voice. I can't make out what she's saying at first, but she's definitely repeating a phrase of some kind. The voice gradually gets louder, but she's still speaking very softly. I'm able to hear her now, as if the volume has increased.

""Oh lord"", she says slowly, with a certain sadness in her voice.

A few moments pass

""Oh, lord"", she says again. Her voice is audible, but feels very distant.

As I continue to float over the planet, she repeats herself a few more times. Her voice, always very soft and distant.

Suddenly, I'm standing alone in a dimly lit hallway. The wind is gone. The floor is a black carpet, with red, velvety walls. There are no doors, just hallway. The hall splits into two directions about 15 feet ahead, only left or right. The only light is coming from a lighting fixture on the ceiling above the hallway intersection. I'm far enough away that I'm standing in the shadows, the hallway behind me is absolutely pitch dark. I move toward the intersection, I realize that I'm able to ""walk"" now, but this is not my body.

I approach the intersection. To the right is a long, dark hallway. Beyond the first 20 feet is shadow, it's pitch black beyond this. To the left, maybe 50 feet away, the hallway stops. On the ceiling at the end of the left hallway is another light fixture, illuminating a large photograph that takes up the entire wall. The photo is of Jupiter, from the same perspective I had only moments ago.

That's when I hear the girl's voice again

""Oh lord"", she says softly with the same sadness, but this time it's not distant at all. It sounds like she's in the hallway with me. I turn around to look... But no one is there, I'm still alone.

""Oh lord"", she says once more as I stare down the empty hallway....

Just a little background, about 2 1/2 months ago my mom passed away after a short stint with really aggressive bone cancer.

In the dream I find myself wishing that she was dead because in real life the hardest part for me wasn’t when she actually died, but seeing her suffer.

Then I wake up feeling bad that I just wished my mom was dead, but then being relieved that she is in fact dead and out of pain.

I would be in some other woman's body, I saw her/myself get raped, so kany different types of rape, but once it was over I was in someone else's body.

I was pushed against a wall by the man, he covered my mouth and began to rape me in this sick, jerky, rushed way. When he finished I was left in a heep on the floor.

Doctor gave her a prognosis of 7-10 years to live “on the longer end” with continued medication. Of course she was devastated, and I asked if it was hereditary. She said no.

I never really go to sleep right away, I like to lay down and just think about stuff, it helps me get things off my mind, but this time was different. 
I deal with a lot of mental health problems, depression, paranoia, stuff like that. Well I was thinking about stuff like that and how I mentally see myself. I see myself as two diffent people as weird as that sounds. A happier person that's ""out"" when i'm around friends and what not, then the normal, emotionless person that's ""out"" when I am by myself.
Well when I tried to think about it and picture the ""emotionless person"" in my head all I saw was black. At first that made me think ""oh hey maybe I don't see myself as two people"" because I didn't actually see anything, but then doing it again I realized what I saw was literally just darkness, nothing. 
The ""dream"" then moved out of my mind and showed my head as a colored X-ray where I could see my brain. Half of it was pink like you would expect, the other half was just black. Between the two halves of the brain was a red door that opened inwards toward the blackness. Someone walked into the black side, I'm not sure who it was, but I am wanting to say it was Rick from Rick & Morty.
Anyways he walks in to see that the room is nothing but darkness and the red door so he walks back through the door, but instead of it being the pink brain it's instead an all white room. Nothing really happens with the white room, instead another Rick just opens the black side and it makes a weird I guess vortex looking thing with the doors. I should also mention during all of this I am still awake, but I didn't actually have control of anything. I tried ""waking up"" but I couldn't I couldn't stop the ""dream"" I even vividly remember saying stop during the door thing.
Eventually so many Ricks open so many doors it basically freezes so I am looking at a half white, half black ""screen"" with some kind of weird door/rick vortex thing in the middle. I then start moving my eyes up and down (still ""awake"") and while doing this it starts ""painting"" a new white room over everything. 
About halfway through I get interrupted for about a second because I get a flash of a white door opening just a crack. It terrified me. I have no idea what it was. After it happened it went straight back to the ""painting"". The door opening made my heart beat like crazy. I have no idea why.
I finished the painting with my eyes and it turned out it was a white room with a light blue bird on the wall, I think it was a tit bird, and a light blue deer on the floor, not sure what the deer looked like. While I was painting the room Moon Man from Rick & Morty was also playing. Not enrely sure why, but it was.  
From there all I know is that I ""woke up"". My eyes hurt from moving them so much and I was so confused because I knew what just happened wasn't a dream and couldn't have been a dream, but I also could get out of it.

If any of you have any idea what it was or what it could have been then feel free to tell me because I am still confused.

(1) Why is it that I do not dream anymore, when I go to sleep there is nothing. Then I wake up. If dreams are messages to the self, does not dreaming mean I have nothing to tell myself or could it mean something actually negative.

(2) My Nightmare:

I was being led by some old lady down a confined and archaic looking spiral staircase. The only light was a torch she was carrying. Suddenly the light went out, I seemed to slip and start falling/sliding down the staircase...in trying to stop I noticed that there no longer were any stairs. I was just indefinitely falling down this spiral structure for what seemed like an endless period of time. I could feel my speed increasing and I was getting more and more nauseous by the second. There was no hope...no light...just fear I didn't know where I was going, I didn't know how to stop this. I kept sliding/falling banging myself against some unseen wall but I could tell even in pitch black I was still in the same spiral structure. Suddenly, without my control, thought, or effort my hand clutched onto something that would best be described as a ledge or rock that was jutting out from whatever wall I kept banging against as I fell. I stopped, there was light and I looked down to see this dark abyss that I could have kept falling into. I then woke up drenched in sweat.

For context, I am a law student going into my second year of law school. Personality wise I am always pushing myself to be the best at what I do. To a seemingly insatiable point. But despite my efforts I have never been the top scorer, the award winner, etc. Recently I elected not to try and obtain a position on law review and yesterday the list was published. Several of my classmates were awarded spots on the flagship law review. I had a rough childhood with regard to my parents and the bonds between members of my family are very weak. Being consistently cast aside by friends and family throughout my life has forced me to feel like I am at war with the world, always feeling like I have something to prove, but always failing at my goal to be the best in the room. I have spent much of my life walking my path alone, but I guess have come to accept that as just what my life is. I wouldn't say I am mentally fragile but I will say that currently I have been often wondering whether the choices I make are the right ones and a great fear of mine that my seemingly immortal nature of insatiability will cause me to be end my life feeling like I never achieved enough.

SO... she told me about her dream the other day... Where there was suddenly a pretty big room inside that hallway closet where I had put in a lot of new IKEA furniture... Like white minimal stuff that I normally wouldn't buy but she said it was pretty nice furniture that she would normally buy.. And then I had decided to knock down the wall into my own bedroom to make an even bigger room.

Now.. the funny thing is that later in the dream, I had a girl over... standing on the veranda and kissing awkwardly she said. She also put in a little detail about that she talked to the girl later, and that she was really cool; professional dancer and stuff.

Thing is that she is a dancer as part of her freelance job... Are you thinking what I am thinking?

Usually it's just random scary shit, not connected with her or anything. But this morning it was fucked up for real, and I am pretty scared. So, at the age of seven she was repeatedly abused by a neighbor. She dreamt that that dude had her drugged on a mattress, and she could only move her hands. He comes on with a big syringe, she fights but eventually he holes her with it. And till then ok, I can figure what it is myself right? 
But then she somehow crawls out that room, and gets to the street. Then (guys that is the fucked up part) she crawls back inside cause she felt like it was safer. Now, I clearly know that now she has no attraction whatsoever to the rapist, but it still put me the doubt that she could have had some kind of Stockholm syndrome when she was a kid(?)

I remember holding it in my hand- studying the red blood vessels on the eye ball. I remember asking my mom why I had grown the eye, like why did I need this extra eye falling out of me. Also I should note that I live with my mom and see her on a daily basis so I don't think her being in my dream is a super relevant aspect... Anyway, she told me I grew it just in case I needed another. 

My desire to learn more about this detail of my dream has little to do with the dream itself and even more to do with how I felt about it once I woke up. I have crazy vivid dreams all the time, but this one shook me. Even in the groggy fog of the morning, I remember feeling like this ""third eyeball"" detail was so important for me to remember. I repeated it over and over to myself in my head after waking up just to make sure I would remember it. I feel like it could mean something or at least can give me more insight into what I'm dealing with subconsciously. 

Another note- I struggle with a lot of depression and anxiety and it's starting to become more difficult to present myself as happy to the outside world. None of my friends see me as depressed or anxious because I take great care to appear that way. They know I have depression and anxiety; they just don't know the extent of it because I don't share the details. I would much rather listen to their problems and give advice. I genuinely enjoy helping my friends but I just don't think sharing my struggles would help me or them very much.  I don't feel like I'm living a lie by concealing this, I just fear that they'll judge me or think I'm unstable. This is irrational, of course, but I just remember struggling with friendships so much in high school because there was a lot of stigma attached to mental illness at that time and I didn't have a really good handle on my depression+ anxiety like I do now.  Nevertheless, I constantly fear I will lose control of my illness like I did in high school and lose the friendships and success I've worked so hard to develop. Maybe that has something to do with the dream.

0.0,8omlj1,2.0,5.0,"This was easily one of the strangest dream I've ever had. There's a bit to unpack, so here we go. 

In the real world, I have a pretty demanding job that's mainly centered on meeting several deadlines. Last night's dream started with me settling down in a kind of crowded Starbucks (by the way, I hate Starbucks). I was struggling to find a place to sit, and my boss was hounding me about something through text message.  I kept telling him to just hang on, and I'd have what he wanted in a half-hour. I don't remember the specific assignment, but I needed to have a few hundred words to him for a report.

At this time, I started noticing small bumps forming on my forearm and near my elbow. Thinking nothing of it and needing to get my boss off my back, I found a table, sat down and started typing away on my laptop. 

The five or six bumps had gotten bigger and starting to itch. Each time I went to scratch them, I noticed they were getting bigger each time I looked at them. At some point I remember a few started to look like long, narrow nipples. This went on for a while, which broke my concentration on whatever I was supposed to be getting done. Then I noticed the bumps started changing.

One of the bumps started growing teeth and formed the shape of a small mouth; another grew into an eye. I looked at my right hand and saw it was splitting as another hand began growing between my middle and ring fingers which has widened. The new hand was necrotic and contorted. 

Meanwhile, I was trying to keep my cool and be discrete about what was happening to me since I was in a public space. 

As soon as I touched the mouth growing on my forearm, I woke up. It was 3 a.m. I went back to sleep shortly after and had no other dreams until I woke up for work three hours later.

0.0,8anvo6,2.0,3.0,"I  have just woken from this a little over an hour ago.

I  could not get asleep tonight for some time, i finally got to sleep at 03:30 i only know this as it was the last i looked at my iPad clock. My partner was asleep beside me, she was deeply sleeping.  When i fell asleep i thought i woke up.

I woke beside her, i was startled awake like when you fall asleep too fast and jolt up, she was comforting me as you would a partner that woke from a bad dream. I felt her touch, her warmth and i could see in perfect detail. I could not shake the ill feeling i had. I fell back and asleep \(In the dream\) and woke again beside her, asking me if i was ok, i thought i woke from a lucid dream she was trying to tell me it was ok \( I have had lucid dreams many times,not like this\), i wanted to leave the bedroom to go to the apartment but she kept trying to prevent it, like she was trying to reason me out of leaving the room. When i tried to leave her efforts would become more aggressive. I felt a malevolence about her, it was like someone else wearing her body, she acted nothing like the real her.

When i relented  and stopped trying to leave the room i woke again, in the bed beside her. Each time thinking this was it, i was awake, relieved and a little freaked out. She again comforted me but when i got up to leave the room she became irritated, and things would become all together unsettling, everything looked and felt real to the touch. Except for her, i could feel her but they way she carried herself was all wrong.

The more i tried to leave the harder she tried to make me stay, she would call family members, her brother answered. I heard him leave his room \(I live with her family in a built on apartment with a connection to the main house\) and he would try to come into the bed room. He was also not right, his actions and mannerisms where all wrong, feared crawled up my back and goosebumps on my arms.

I woke beside her again, she was not in bed. I felt groggy, really groggy. I rolled and literally fell out of the bed, i hit the hardwood floor. It actually hurt. I thought she was in the bathroom and i was finally awake. She returned but did not help me or comfort me. I was sweating. She walked around the bed and lay on it. Started talking about me and what i could have here. She showed me my kids, two boys \(I do not have kids\) one looked to be six and the other two or three. The older one was laying on the bed bides her on his side like he was asleep but he eyes where open like he was lost in a daze. When i turned the younger one was standing beside the bed on her side, i was stunned i did not know what to do or say.

I walked slowly to the younger one The younger one scared me. Its movements and actions where unnatural, its voice broken and eerie.  I could not make out its words. I moved for the door quickly, Her demeanor changed. She was angry like i rejected something. I knew by now this was not real, the environment was not real. It was in my head and i was asleep. But she felt real and not apart of my minds creation.

She was sliding to her feet off the bed with purpose. Like i figured out something i should not have. I tried to leave and she griped my arm, she was strong. It hurt. I woke up in the bed again with her beside me also awake. She was mumbling something to herself or to me. I did not care to listen i tried to wake up. Pain in a dream normally works but not here. I clawed my face and pinched, i felt it, it was painful like in the waking world but nothing. I had flashes of where my movement was like i was under water in high pressure like i was waking up. But nothing i could not wake.

I ran from the room. She was angry now, really angry. She threw herself from the bed. I was through he bedroom door already i moved quickly to the apartment, got in and closed the door. I could her her and her brother frantically talking as i tried to lock the door. She had her keys, i got the door locked first. She was ranting at  me through the door. I had locked it and left the key in turned so it could not be pushed out from the other side, i did not feel safe. She spat at the door, berating me.

The family are locksmith by trade. Her brother was working on the door from her side. I ran down the stairs to the apartment front door and ran into the street. I got a good distance down the road. I could feel and smell the still night air. I could feel the coarse tarmac of the road on my bare feet. I thought i was ok for now as long as i kept moving.

I woke up again. In the bed. The lights on. She was by the door. Unimpressed to say the least. I got up from bed, i was scared. I have never lucid dreamed this long before. She opened the door and the brother came  in and someone i have not met in the real world, a construct of my mind?. He was gentle of nature and appearance but still his mannerisms where off. He said to me ""you know what your doing right, your creating paradoxes"". He said the name of a paradox starting with the letter M i did not recognize it nor could i hold on to the name after waking it was five or six characters long. He told me i have to go somewhere now, that i wont like it, but i have to go. I could not leave the room as she was still at the door with her brother. I felt powerless and scared. He took my hand it was cold.

I woke up beside her. I was drenched in sweat, groggy as hell frantically looking around and mumbling is it real, heart racing and shaking. She did not move, still in a deep sleep. i sat there for what felt like a long time. I got my wits together and rolled over to check the time, it was 04:40. A little over a hour of sleep in real\-time.

I was sure i was awake now. I still felt scared and honestly like crying for a moment. I had to mentally will myself to get out of bed and move to the door. I took a deep breath and opened it to a pitch black hallway. Flicked on the light. I was awake, no feeling off ill will or malevolence from my environment, no noise the house was silent.

I splashed my face and cannot go back asleep. I have never had this level of lucidity in dreams. The feel, touch, smell, fear and it felt like i was in this loop for many many hours. It was overpowering.

It likely means nothing and was just that, a dream. But i do not have nightmares. Never, this did not feel like a nightmare. It felt different, when the man said to me i have to go somewhere but wont like it. I thought i was going to die in my sleep. I really thought whatever was about to happen was final.

Even now her brother woke up to use the bathroom and i hear him outside. I am honestly freaked out still. Like i'm second guessing myself and my reality. My partner is the most loving, warm and caring person i have ever met we have been together nine years and are very happy. The women in my dream wore her skin, her body but it was not her and i cannot understand how my subconscious constructed all this.

I  have left some loops out that of this post that are now fractured as the details are slipping away on waking. But i attest to this being true and not a conjured story.

Is there a way to find meaning in this?. It feels like it was a warning or a threat. I apologize for my grammar and poor typing, i am still groggy and tired at this hour and had to get it out before i lost the details.

My dream last night was about 2 diamond rings, not ones that I actually own, one with a large sapphire in the middle surrounded by small diamonds. 

In the dream I was dressed in some kind of period clothing (although that may be from binge watching downton abbey!) and I was walking up a steep bank with rows of shops either side. I felt something drop from my hand and looked down to see I was wearing an unfamiliar ring on my left middle finger. It was similar to a half eternity ring with a row of diamonds, one of which had just dropped out. As I bent to pick it up another one fell, then another. I began panicking that I would loose them all on the pavement as they were quite small and a strange shape, flat on both sides with faceted edges.

When I thought I had collected them all, I checked the other ring on my hand, this one on my ring finger, and saw that almost all the diamonds surrounding the sapphire had fallen out too. I began to really panic then and was basically crawling along the street searching for them, begging people not to walk on the path. 

In the end I became suddenly calm again and decided that I had found enough of them and that it was a shame I had lost some but it couldn’t be helped.

I then checked my right hand where my actual engagement ring was in the dream (irl I only wear my wedding and engagement rings, and on my left ring finger) and was pleased to see that it’s gems were still securely in place.

I had a weird dream last night. One of those extra vivid ones which sticks around after you've woken up.

I was in a tall building in a room, that looked like [this](http://utabrandstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/A-magnificent-rustic-decorating-ideas-for-living-rooms-fulfilled-with-chicness-from-patterned-couchs-rectangular-curvy-leg-table-painting-lamps-and-buffet.jpg), and celebrating something with 4 people i've never met. They were dressed up in aztec style clothing. Two of them were wearing aztec style warrior gear similar to [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Aztec_Warriors_%28Florentine_Codex%29.jpg).

The other two were dressed like colourful birds one green, one red, and they seemed to be the non violent type. They dressed kind of like ([this](https://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/data/13030/7s/ft8870087s/figures/ft8870087s_00046.jpg)). 

We were all dancing, although i was watching them from the corner of the room. Out of the corner of my eye, i noticed the red dancing bird strike down one of the warriors. Before i could react the green bird stabbed the other warrior in the face with a knife that looked like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/03/13/b7/0313b757cd742414bfef4c065db187ba.jpg), except with a white blade.

The really odd thing was that, even though the two warriors were dying and bleeding, they continued to try and dance with the birds until they were on the floor and the birds were dancing around them as though it were a sacrifice ritual.

My first instinct was to jump out the window to escape, but the building was too high and i hadn't realised it was a dream yet, so i felt cornered and vulnerable. The only way out was a door on the other side of the birds. 

I ran for the door on the other side of the bloodbath, and the green bird turned towards me as though it had only just noticed i was watching the whole time, and started running towards me with the white obsidian blade.

The door had 3 circular handles with oldschool locks that take those big iron keys, like [this](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iur/?f=1&image_host=http%3A%2F%2Fthumbs.dreamstime.com%2Fz%2Fold-door-lock-white-34058978.jpg&u=https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/old-door-lock-white-34058978.jpg). I've had a dream where i'm fumbling with a key before, but strangely, this time i managed to open all the handles without even needing a single key, and managed to get outside the room, all the while feeling confident i would make it, but also realising i was about to be murdered. I slammed the door shut and all three locks locked up automatically, and i was safe, then i woke up.

I personally think it's my brain doing some odd symbolic version of the whole flamboyant new age millenial post modernists overtaking the old generations. Even though the traditional warriors are being killed off, they are forced to comply with the birds rituals as they slowly die.

I dunno... What do you think?

0.0,7p672m,1.0,4.0,"Okay, so this happened quite awhile ago but I remember it rather clearly. First let me start with a quick go-over of the dream I had. There was a concrete room, shaped like a square. There was a wall with a small prison-bar window about 6 feet above the ground, and a sink beneath it. On the wall to the left was a metal frame and a single mattress on it. No pillow. There was a concrete pillar in the middle of the room. If you stood on side opposite the sink, it was big enough to cover the sink from view. On the far end of the wall that was to the right of the sink was a very thin hallway. It bent in an L-shape about 3 feet in to a small area with a toilet. I guess this was to give some sense of privacy from the rest of the room?  
I believe that in the dream I was a soldier. I had no idea why I was in the room but I know I wasn't captive in it. I was visiting someone. A girl was standing by the sink, couldn't have been out of her elementary school years. Her hair was pitch black, and went down to her knees. She wore a slightly dirty, white dress. She was crying. I bent down to try and talk to her, but she wouldn't stop sobbing. I was trying to comfort her, but her hair was covering her face and she wouldn't look up. That's all I remember from that particular dream.  
The next dream was weeks later. It started off as kind of a silly one. I was a secret agent parachuting into foreign territory to steal some kind of intel. One of the agents tripped the alarm and enemy soldiers were running everywhere trying to find the intruders. I broke into a room, stole a lab coat and snuck away. I kept looking around until I found an unlocked door and ran inside.  
It was a locker room. I decided to explore, and came across a gaping hallway. Must've been 10 feet wide by 20 feet tall. Bare concrete. It looked so out of place in-between a row of lockers. All I knew was that I felt compelled to walk in and find out what was at the other end. I kept walking and walking for what felt like forever, then next thing I knew, I was in a concrete room. It looked so familiar (I'm getting goosebumps just typing this part out haha). There was a bed to my left, and a wall with a small prison bar window high up, and a sink below it really close to ground height. Low enough to the ground for a child to use. And there was a pillar in the middle of the room that blocked off sight of whatever was on the opposite end wherever you stood. Then I realized I knew this room. I had no idea it was a dream, but I knew it was the room with the little girl. I wanted to cheer her up, so I looked around for her. Under the bed? No. Behind the pillar? No. Then I looked at the narrow hallway and called down it a couple times. No response. I peeked just far enough to see if any feet would be peeking out around the corner and nobody was there. I was puzzled, it seemed like she just disappeared. It was when I turned around to leave that I noticed there was a doll, standing on the ground next to the sink, just looking down. It was a ceramic baby doll. The kind you'd give to a child to take care of. It had a onesie on, and it was missing its eyeballs. Just looking at it gave me chills, and typing about it right now sends waves of goosebumps down my arms and back. I saw that doll and figured it was time to leave. As I was about to walk down the hallway, I heard a noise behind me. Something creaky. I slowly turned around and saw the doll, standing about a foot and a half behind me. It wasn't looking up, but it straight ahead at the back of my legs. An intense feeling of dread washed over me as I looked back towards the hallway again, but it was gone. I was starting to panic at this point, so I tried to look around the room for a way out. Then I heard it. The doll was following me. Its joints made an unmistakable noise, similar to the gears in a wind-up doll grinding together so it could move. On instinct, I started walking around the pillar. It started walking too. I picked up the pace and ran, but it kept the same distance. Never got closer or further away. I kept running harder and harder but the doll never lost a step. Eventually, I panicked until the point where I dropped to my knees, helpless, just openly accepting whatever happened next. Then everything went black, and I woke up.  
  
  
I woke up with the strongest feeling that I was about to die, and that something was watching. It was a bright and early morning, but I immediately opened the curtains and turned on the lights haha.

If there is any context I haven't covered just let me know.

I'm in school in sociology class and the bell rings and every one leaves but I'm still talking to my sociology teacher. We're joking around and just having some banter and in this dream he's the slightest bit taller than me. He gives me a hug and I hug him back and he then kisses me on the cheek. Then I can't remember what leads us to do this but we go on a bus because we are going to the train station to go to central London and this is on a school day when we should both be in class. Whilst at the train station I loose my bag and start panicking and then we split up to find it and he finds it and brings it back to me with a present I then hug him and thank him. We stay in central London till late and he gets drunk somehow. I don't know where he lives so I take him back to school. When I get to the classroom the other sociology teacher is waiting there. I explain the situation and we try to help sir sober up but he's gone to sleep. She then asks me if I had sex with him. I say no of course not but I think I really like him and apparently it's okay for me to hug, kiss and unprofessionally hang out with my teacher but not okay for me to have sex with...

Then I'm dealing with this customer who's Russian and he accidentally booked a eye test for his daughter but didn't mean too, so I'm like cool I'll cancel it. Then he starts shouting at me saying you don't even work here, you haven't got a uniform and really starts shouting at me. He then proceeds to push me and he does this three times and I say IM A FUCKING MINOR, IM UNDER 18. He then goes ""oh no... I don't care"" and punches me in the chest. He then calmly walks away and now I am determined to sue him. I ask my manager if I can sue him and she's like yeah of course. So I get a lawyer and he's like u can win this, we have enough evidence and then when he reads the name of the guy I'm suing he's like ""nahhhhhhhhh, I'm gonna skrrrr da pa pa ka ka ka out this door"" ( he didn't actually say that but something along the lines of ""no"") he tells me there is no chance of me winning as anyone that has tried to sue him as lost and then ended up dead. Now I'm in a giant assembly hall and on one side is loads of American schools and the other is just our sixth form and then there are all the American politicians. I'm playing with lego building something and then George bush comes in and is like ""that's a nice lego model can I see it?"" So I hand him the lego model and he fucking breaks it and walks away.

It all feels real and I bike for an indefinite amount of time when suddenly, my bike crashes into something/ride of a kind-of ramp or something and goes flying GTA 5 physics style.

0.0,6mij9q,0.0,3.0,"Okay so I'm going to detail some dreams I've had, the first being one I had last night & the rest are dreams I had within the last 6 months that I can remember enough to describe them.

1. So my family is at a house, that I believe belongs to the a family my family knows ( in the dream, they dont own this house in real life). It is a massive house, probably four stories with yellow weather boarding heaps of windows & a red tin roof. All I can really remember from the inside of the house that it seemingly had an endless amount of rooms, it was really huge. Across from the house was like this antique sale or store, like it wasn't in a building it just had all this old stuff on the tables and stuff. Everytime I went over to the antique sale, there would be two woman at a table, who were normal and there would be a little lamb that could talk on the other end, she (the lamb) is very friendly and just talks about normal shit and stuff. Anyway, at the antique stall when I'm there in the dream a little hut manifests, not like in front of me but I look and it's there, I go inside and there's all this information about the guy that used to own the big house on the walls & stuff that belonged to him on a table. I remember that it said he was a Mayor that declared himself King & tyrannized the town nearby and took his daughters as wives or some crazy shit like that. I wasn't weirded out by this at all in the dream. Then I remember something going wrong?? I can't remember what, but something was after me and I went down a cave that turned out to be hell. Now the cave was close to the antique sale from what I can remember, and going down the cave was kind of like going down a slide into just a red pit, not a pit of fire but as if it was just emminating intense red light. As I'm going down I'm in pain and I'm burning and some firey red face comes out of the red around me and says some shit I don't remember, and that's all I remember.

2. Another dream I have had is when I'm going on a walk in my suburb, now my suburb is an Australian outer suburb in a rural town, and at the back of my suburb is like a stretch of bush on a hill with a walking track, it's pretty small, and behind it is another suburb. But in these dreams, I'm walking around the suburb, heaps of houses that aren't there in real life, and when I get to the bush walking track it's just massive, like the bush area. Like I could kind of describe it as being like the blue mountains but as if it was in the outback. This bush area in the dream appears to be never ending, and a whole host of stuff can happen in this vast expanse of bush varying from dream to dream. This walking track near my house appears in alot of my dreams and it's always the same, massive & never ending. 

3. Another dream that I've had a few times is where I'm just going about my every day business, going out with friends & hanging out and for some reason I see this weird thing in the sky, it comes down, kind of like a satellite but there's somebody in it?? like driving it, and it comes down and goes back up, and we're just looking at it in awe. One dream I went to a carnival in my town & the satellite was present, like I knew it was in the sky. In one dream it crashed into my house, and in a couple of dreams it's crashed to the ground and in one dream I can remember I went in it. Now even though I call it a satellite it really isn't now that I think of it. I just call it a satellite because that's what comes to mind. It certainly doesn't seem extraterrestrial, it's very much terrestrial as you can see wire poking from it, it always looks very primitive (electronically speaking), as if it was put together very quickly. 

Anyway that's everything I'd like interpreted cause I certainly can't make sense of any of it. If they can be interpreted of course, it might very well just be random dreams with no real meaning but yeah.

I want to start off by writing that this was an 18+ dream. I'm a 23-year girl and in a relationship for over two years now. We haven't had any 'physical contact' in over three months, I'm not sure I think it's way longer than that. 

Dream part
So I was myself in my dream. I went to a bar and had to go to the toilet, for some reason, there was a weird meeting going on in there and I flirted with a girl. There was also a couple in a stall just sitting and the guy was masturbating and we just listened and I became aroused. When I was finished, I said something to the leader/teacher and from the way we were speaking to each other, I knew we knew each other very well. I can't remember what I said but it was something along the lines of this.

Teacher: 'You always take the good ones.'
Me: *wink* 'You bet I do.'

 I took the girl, another girl and a guy back to my place where we had 'physical contact'. Also, the 'girls' were trans apparently (if you know what I mean). I felt really awesome in the dream.

I keep having these dreams that I'm trying to talk to someone (a different person every time) but every time I open my mouth to say anything, the only thing that comes out is this terrifying screaming that doesn't sound like it should be coming from me or any human being and it fucking terrifies me. I can never wake up right away and it seems like I'm always trying to warn them about something but when I wake up I never remember what I was trying to say or warn them about. The only people I remember who I've tried to warn/talk to in my dreams are my sister and my boyfriend but it's always a different person and I don't remember most of their faces.

Now, I know some of you will go with the classic ""You have something you aren't telling these people and it's getting to you"" interpretation but I've seen that matched to merely being unable to speak. I don't care about not being able to speak in the dream so much as that when I DO try to speak this terrifying screaming starts up and I always wake up wondering if I was screaming while asleep too. I'm just wondering if there would even be a different interpretation or if this is supposedly because I'm holding something back. The reason I don't believe this is the best interpretation is because I literally have nothing to hide. I'm a very open and honest person whether that means telling someone to go suck a dick because I hate them or telling someone what my real opinion is regardless of them being friends with me. Point is, there is no big secret or anything that I'm hiding so I guess I'd just like you all to think it over and tell me what you might think it is.

0.0,5putcf,0.0,4.0," I really like this sub so I hope this post doesn't come across the wrong way. I really enjoy reading dreams and love giving interpretations. But I see a lot of dreams lacking vital information necessary to giving an interpretation. From the sidebar:

>Including age, gender, and any relevant goings on in your life will help us get a better idea of where you're coming from

In order to get an accurate interpretation it's necessary to have some contextual clues as to what the elements of the dream might represent. I see many posts asking for answers but few are getting any. This is because there is no information (aside from the details of the dream) for interpreters to go off of.  

The details of the dream by themselves don't give an interpreter much to work with. It's the stuff that's going on in your life that provides the necessary clues that allow inferences and speculation about the dream's possible meaning(s). 

 You don't have to give away any sensitive info; just some quick stats will do. You should provide the reader with some understanding of what's going on in your life that could be influencing or informing the circumstances of your dream. Then you can get an informed reflection and even some discussion about your dream.

So in the dream I am waiting at a fictional bus station in my town, located where the recreational center is in real life. Not far from my home actually. I've bought a ticket home... I could have easily walked. The bus arrives, I get in and it's fairly crowded so I have to sit right next to the driver. We drive around town a little while. I might have fallen asleep, not sure, but suddenly it's dark outside the bus and we're not in town anymore. It doesn't occur to me that I very likely missed my stop and I stay in my seat. Next time I am conscious (in the dream) it's sunny outside. We're driving in these beautiful hilly surroundings, old-fashioned windmills outside, fenced-in-cows grassing on the meadows, old wooden windmills etc. I ask the female driver where we are.

She's a young girl, somewhere between fourteen and sixteen, hard to tell because girls mature faster than boys, but she's in that range. She has ruby-red hair. That's not an exaggeration: it's maroon or dark red and glitters in the light. I don't know this girl, but I'm standing on a field, the grass is very short but vividly green, so much that it made an impression. I notice that it's cold, the sky is overcast suddenly, and this girl is playing. I think she's playing soccer, but there's no ball. Either way, she's very excited and very competitive. I don't see the other players, I only have my eyes on her. I catch glimpses of shoes and sweatpants, but I mostly see her dark blue jeans and the beige cotton sweater she's wearing.

I realize as I stand there that I love this girl. I'm not physically attracted to her, I don't want to romance her, but I care deeply for her well being. I don't want to take my eyes off her in this spot. Someone else is trying to make conversation with me, but I'm focused on her.
Eventually, she trips and skids on the field, making some mud stains on her pants. I hurry over, not even attempting to mask my concern. I'm driven there, I don't even consider whether she's actually okay. I crouch beside her and look at her, holding out my hands but not touching her. I think I say something, but it's trivial, something like ""Are you all right?"" or ""Did you hurt yourself?"" She looks back up at me with laughing eyes, a little embarrassed by me. ""I just tripped a little,"" she chuckles, ""daddy."" I don't have any children. I'm nineteen.

She gives me dismissive look: I'm the overprotective dad embarrassing her in front of her friends. I apologize and excuse myself. She goes back to playing, looking back at me a few times to remind me she's okay. I think about how different she is from me: I'm neither athletic nor competetive, and she has a certain playful outward hostility. But then, her eyes are the same, and when she talks it's as if I told her what to say, because I think her words before she utters them. Even though I don't know this girl, I know I love her, and I can feel that she loves me too, because everything she says is tinged with humor and respect.

We argued a lot for a month and decided to end it, we smile and say hello on the street today so it ended good.
So the dream- i was back in my Elementary school building (in Serbia we go to Elementary for 8 years,then 4 years of highschool) and everyone i've ever talked to from highschool was there, the versions that i had last seen the last day of highschool a month back. I went up to the first floor and saw my best friend that ive known since we were 2 in the crowd and he told me he was there for some practice classes for the university entrance exam. 
He passed by and i looked arround figuring everyone was there for that. I don't know why i was there.
So i go back down and before the exit my now ex runs up to me with a huge smile and jumps up in my hands. We kiss and talk just like we did when we were together. I remember feeling the intense emotion i got every time i'd look at her back when we were together. 
So i carry her like that outside to the small steps of the school entrance  and stand there holding her, we talk and look in each others eyes for a bit, i grab her ass and we smile and kiss and she goes back inside and i go home. 
Now when i get home i'm stricken with a though '' Wait why did we just do that when we're not together???

One time a girl noticed me wall running, so she tried to do it as well, she failed but she managed to open some kind of stairs in the backyard, so I went there to check it out.  When I went inside, the stairs closed and I was trapped there, I started morphing into a half-spider (human upper body and spider body instead of legs, you can Google ""Drider""). I also realised that I became a female, which honestly isn't anything strange to me at this point.

Being a Drider felt really weird, but pleasant at the same time. I could breathe dirty air without coughing, and I felt like i could touch anything without getting dirty (those are mostly my weird things though, I don't like touching anything really dirty with my skin and when I try to breathe dirty air I feel sick). I was also horny all the time for some weird reason.

I had a walkie-talkie with me, so my best friend tried to contact me, he asked me where I am, so I told him what happened. He then told me that the school called police after me, so I got anxious, as they knew where I was. While I looked for something to defend myself with, I accidentally made a pose with my hand like Spider-man (middle and ring fingers touching my palm) and I shot out some web, though it wasn't that strong and there was very little of it. Unfortunately, I could not climb.  


At this point there was a cut in my dream, I started the second part of it somewhere in the city. For some reason though, no one really cared or was interested that I was a half-spider.  The second part was kind of boring so I'll just mention one interesting thing that happened:

When I went to a public bathroom during comic-con, where people thought that I was a cosplayer, I tried to fake the fact that I was fixing my costume (For a weird reason it was backwards, I couldn't fix it without getting naked, and when I fixed it, people realized that it wasn't a costume and that I was actually a Drider.

Mainly once  The dream had reached this part, I was holding a hamster in my hand that had the front half a skeleton and the back half of a live hamster, the skeleton could not move but the hamster part could.  I’ve been believed I had to put the hamster in my mouth and I did, I didn’t chew it or anything I just held in my mouth and then woke up very confused and frightened. What can this mean????
Information to consider: I have narcolepsy, I have a hamster

There was a man (who in the dream i knew, and was in a relationship with) pulled me up, injuring himself in the process. I then pulled him aside and began nursing him and holding him. Like I said, I can't remember what the full context was or even if it was ever made clear...but I do remember that whatever the journey was it was meant to be unpleasant. It was raining everywhere except on us, like some sort of force field around was around us. So there we were in this terrible sitaution and all i remember feeling was intense love between myself and this man. Like.... something I had never felt in my actual waking life. We weren't speaking, but there was a mutual feeling of overwhelming love between us. I was him and he was me....almost like a drug trip or something. No words, just love. It's crazy because I don't remember anything about what he looked like, his height, build, race...nothing but his gender is still clear to me. What led me to write this post was that this was one of the most realistic dreams I have ever had...I feel like i actually know what it feels like to be in love with someone from that dream...and when i woke up i almost felt like I had just gone through a breakup for a few seconds before i was fully awake...because the man in the dream was just a dream, lol. Now I'm just wondering what others think about this? I have been feeling like the more I accept myself the more I think about finding a mate...wondering if this dream is telling me its almost time? idk...thoughts?

EDIT: i wanted to mention that we were not the only two people around, there were tens of others also climbing that cliff, and running past us when we made it to the top. while i was holding and nursing my mate, people were running past us and i could hear others down the cliff.

10 years as a paramedic, currently active
5 years before that as a volunteer firefighter
3 years before that corrections/sporadically road deputy with another officer 

This dream happened today while I was getting in a nap during some down time at the station.  Currently on a rotating 24 hour shift where anytime after 1700 (5pm) we can snooze as long as we are able to answer the radio, obviously it’s turned up super loud.
This is not a flash back dream of any sort.
I grew up in Tennessee near the Georgia border but currently reside, work, and live 280 miles (Aprox) from Georgia, still in Tennessee. 

So here it is... 

So in this dream I was sitting at station ... and for what ever reason I’m working with a partner I’ve never seen before, and she is going on and on about how perfect she is and how crap everyone else including me is, and I step outside to call our HR director to say if I work a single shift with her again I quit on the spot, (not something I would normally do) and this isn’t at a station I recognize right, so this guy walks up, in a Georgia Hwy patrol uniform, walks right up to me punches me in the gut and says his car broke down and I need to help him. 

So some other guys out of no where come running up and knock the guy down I call for law enforcement, and poof (think time skip) Tennessee hwy patrol is there along with several deputies, and the guy attacks me again saying he’s not going to jail and me and him end up wrestling and some how we are now on the ground and this guy bites down, like almost tearing flesh on my rear end and clamps down like a Doberman. 

 The cops are like completely helpless to do anything, one shouted “taze him“ another said “ No that will taze the medic too”, another shouted “shoot him”, THP said “no that might hit the medic”, so now I’m trying to get this guy to release his death bite by pressing into his temples and pressing into his eyeballs and nothing was working, he apparently didn’t feel pain, finally somehow I got free and we put him in cuffs and into a deputies cruiser.

THP asked me to ride with them to the station to fill out assault and attempted murder charges and this THP officer was on the traffic interdiction team so he was in a an unmarked old as sin 1980s two door Lincoln continental (google the image) and I get in and was like.. how do people feel when they get pulled over by this thing.... he responded with “like getting bit in the ass by some rando” and then I woke up due to station phone ringing


I guess it’s worth noting that none of the faces of anyone in this dream other than my own I could place or recognize.  None of the officers I’ve come to know and work with, etc etc.

0.0,99dat2,2.0,2.0,"So for the past three nights I have been dreaming about my mother and my female cousin.  I have cut my mother and my cousin out for reasons that are not relevant here but let it be known it is because of what they have done to me in the past together.

So the dreams have been me going to Christmas one day and then the next night it was a restaurant.  I tried to ignore them both but they were there.

Last night I dream I'm vomiting all over the place; either in a trashbasket or I find napkins or tissues but I'm in a constant state of vomiting and hoping no one sees me.  I think I hide it pretty well.  So I find myself at a house party yet I'm still throwing up.  I go into the bathroom one time and no one seems to think anything of this by the way, and I come out and my mother and cousin are at this house party.  My cousin confronts me, I dont remember what she said, but I'm like can't you see I'm a little busy right now?  And my alarm went off and I woke up.

So I get to the dream dictionary and it says ""you need to confront and let go something that is revolting in your life""  It's not a far stretch to say I definitely consider my cousin revolting.  My mother is just a constant nagging figure in these dreams but they are together.  

So all this is really long and idk why I'm suddenly having these dreams.  No one is contacting me.  I've cut out all contact thereby getting rid of what is revolting in my life so I'm getting really tired of these dreams as they keep escalating.  Any other thoughts than just the dream dictionary interpretation.  Thanks for any help!!

Last night while I was sleeping I had a dream.  I don’t remember too many details about the first part of the dream. What I do remember, I woke up in my bed and saw the upper half of a human-like being.  The skin was a blue-grey and covered in scars and burns and extremely muscular.  The thing looked down at me, bald head, black eyes, mouth full of fangs.  It reached to me, fingers like talons saying “you’re mine now.” This s when I woke up for real, feeling like I had someone (probably atleast as heavy as me) sitting on my chest, and a hand squeezing my throat.  I try to yell out for anyone around but nothing comes out.  Before I pass out the weight and hand vanish.  I sit up and my dog jumps onto my bed, and starts sniffing and looking around me like something was there and he’s trying to figure out what happened to it.
Now I’m too scared to let myself go back to sleep.  I wasn’t sure if I should post this here or in one of the paranormal groups.  I would like some help figuring out what happened.

In the dream there is a bird stuck in my house. I try to get it out and while I’m brushing it out with a broom I realize it is actually an owl with piercing eyes. The owl stares at me and communicates with me (it doesn’t talk, but somehow I know what it wants). The owl seems untrustworthy, sinister. It has important information for me but it won’t tell me unless I give it something in return. It wants to know something from me but I can’t figure out what it wants to know. It increasingly gets angrier and attacks my head with it’s talons a few times. Finally it grabs hold of my right ear and crushes it between it’s talon. It grips tighter and tighter and the pain becomes intolerable. I kill the owl by bashing my head and it (the owl) against the floor, but it still doesn’t let go. 


A question for anyone: 

What are some cultural significant beliefs about owls? I’m interested in knowing more about the history of owls being used as a symbol. Any sources would be welcomed.

She tells me that she has seen my husband with another woman.  The lady who tells me this is unknown to me, and so is the woman my husband is allegedly seeing.

The next occasion I am with my mother, without my husband.  I get a call on my cellphone from a company and I initially dismiss it as a sales call and hang up on them.  But they persist and call back to tell me the same information, that my husband is seeing another woman.

The third occasion we have returned to the same B&B as in the first paragraph, and the same lady comes to an open window and this time shows me pictures from her cellphone of my husband with another woman on a bus.  They aren't doing anything inappropriate, they just appear together.

Well the wolf saw me looking at it through my living room window. This caused him to take of towards my door. I promptly ran over to it and locked it, fumbling with the locks. And went back to my bedroom a few mins later i went back into the living room to see if the wolf had gone and it was sitting by my open door. The wolf came at me. At first kinda aggrively, but calm enough for me to subdue him I pull the wolf from the neck (I was standing over his back and was bending over him with my arms wrapped around his neck kinda like in was giving him a bear hug) and I walked/pulled him thro the door connecting my house to my moms house (for lack of a better description we basically live in a dulpex) i wake her up, surprisingly the wolf wasnt growly or really fighting me at all. Her bull mastiff wakes up as well and hes obviously awear of the the wolf I'm hold and is weary about it, but not being aggressive towrd the wolf at all. I told mom I needed her help to get the wolf outside, but we needed to get the two smaller dogs inside (i think they were two of my cats that just manifested themselves as dogs in the dream, based off the coat colors) anyway I asked mom to either get the dogs in or hold the wolf. She picked to hold the wolf and he let us change off. He was never fighting me in dream or anything. That's when I woke up.

I dont kno if this matters but the wolf was a dark gray color. Like a charcoal gray and his fur was extremely soft. I also think it's worth noting that I fell alseep watching Zoo, which if you havent seen is a TV show about animals attacking humanity pretty much.

**This is going to be fragmented, because so much shit just happened it’s akin to like an eight hour movie or several days of my life and I don’t have the right language to truly describe to you what just happened.**

**Mom was rich, and had health problems, a huge hole in her ankle. We had family over (family I’ve never seen, and A LOT of them) The last thing I remember from them was talking to someone before I walked away randomly basically mid conversation because I was being antisocial and didn’t feel like talking to them.** **I went walking through the house and there were weird rooms in it. I think I remember a really plush stuffed animal room or something. ((I WAS HAVING A NIGHTMARE IN MY DREAM WITH ONE OF THEIR VOICES ((the family)) AND IT SNAPPED TO ME AND YOU IN SOME GARAGE AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT IT BEFORE WE GOT TO THE KIDS PART, WHICH I’LL TELL YOU ABOUT LATER)), you were over, the house was a huge mansion and my neck was all fucked up. It’s like I had a giraffe neck that was wayyy too long and went up and over to the left, I had to keep holding it in place.** **Jacob came over with some weird black kid that was like someone I knew but wayyy different. I remember going into a room and mom was showering, but covered, and people were in there just talking to her like it was normal. That’s when I seen her ankle and some weird shit came out of it like a puss puck. At some point I was roaming through the house and got to a part of the house that led to a “mall/Walmart”, in the back of that mall/Walmart was a REALLY weird room with trippy geometry and lights in it with a Japanese gameshow theme to it. It was white like that void squidward gets put into on spongebob, and it had weird ass creatures/statues in it that I can’t even begin to describe other than they looked like virtual polygon abstract painting clown duck sculptures that were alive. I also had a Somalian (dark skinned female with full body and facial tribal tattoos) “coach” who was female who popped up to tell me about stuff. Before that happened, as I was LITERALLY running the fuck up out of that room someone or someone on a tv stopped me and was talking about it. All I remember is that they said something about me being a monster, but it was joking. Like in the tone of “you’re not a monster, you don’t even know what that means, you think you know what bad is, I can show you” It was really patronizing but in retrospect had an underlying threatening tone, or almost endearing too. It was sooo weird man. I asked her about the room (my somalian coach who sat me down at a computer to show me her somalian website <,<) and don’t remember what she said, other than at the end I asked her if it would be bad to go all the way into it and she just said “No” before she vanished. So I went in that room and some girl I used to go to school with in grade school came up to me with a note full of stuff I had said bad about her as if we had been dating or something and I broke her heart and called her a dog (I’VE NEVER EVEN DATED OR REMOTELY ROMANTICALLY TALKED TO THIS GIRL AND THE NOTE HAD PICTURES OF A DOG FACE ON IT AND WORDS), and then these people came in** **from the other side of the room trying to get me to go further into the room because it was in stages, and I ran the fuck out because shit got so weird, I have never seen anything like this dream in my entire life. After going in the room, everything in the dream changed and people began talking about the room in other parts of the dream and they were starting to dissappear and weird shit kept happening all around me. They were trying to take me to the room. I’m getting goosebumps writing this because I can’t even convey to you what just happened to me fully, my language is sooooo limited. It even looped in on itself, I had a dream within a dream within a dream. You and I were at some place with teenagers at some point, and they started talking about the room and feeding me or making me face something that lived in it. As in we were with them, and even you and the kids got up like you weren’t who you really were and then started moving toward me trying to grab me. I ran by a house with a door open, and I could see through the door that there was another door that was opening and closing on its own, the entity the kids wanted to give me to was doing it, that’s all I know about that part. I ran slightly after that and there was this place I seen people squeezing into to escape, it looked like one of those pop up garages you see people get in their yards with the metal roofs on them except it had stuff shoved under it so as to make a very narrow way to squeeze through. I followed them and It turned into a hallowed out bus, as I got halfway through it, two giant spiders crawled in the other end and starting chasing me. After that happened, something picked up the bus, or it went freefalling from the top of the world and spun around a really cartoonish/hd/trippy animated planet with me in the top preparing to die and meet my maker. LITERALLY. I WAS THINKING, I AM ABOUT TO DIE, I HAD BETTER MAKE PEACE WITH GOD. Half of the bus got ripped off and I seen this huge green volcano alien monster that was alive and talking, as well as a giant talking gorilla that put King Cong to shame, the bus almost hit the back of his head on one of its “revolutionary orbits”. The monster said something about how it almost had me, but we barely missed it. The last thing I remember was being eaten by that monster as the half of the bus I was In fell down into its mouth with the open end facing toward its mouth.**

**This is the weirdest dream I have ever had, and Nikki I haven’t even told you all of it, and it was so real and life like I can’t believe it. I am utterly bewildered because this did not feel like a dream at all, it felt like I was somewhere else living a life (I EVEN WOKE UP FROM A DREAM IN MY DREAM AND WAS TALKING ABOUT IT TO MY GIRLFRIEND IN THE DREAM BEFORE IT SHIFTED SCENES), I felt the emotions and sensations of this dream. It was as real as waking life, if not realer, and there’s no goddamned way I came up with this on my own. This is a VERY poor and incomplete explanation of what the fuck just happened to me.

I didn’t even know I was in a dream, I thought that was my life, and it felt just like how real life feels but so fucking alien and weird.

Is it archetypical? Or am my mind trying to tell me of an imminent death close to me?

The first night was this:
> I had a nightmare. We were at a cabin in the woods. We were reading books. There was a story of a serial killer who had sent pieces of his victims in mail to the remaining. Then my mother got a package. She knew what it was. I opened the packge. In it was folded cotton packages, and in one my fathers ear. 

>I was sad, then angry. Then felt weak, as I realized there was a killer who could kill us as well. I ran out into the night. I had an axe. I threw it at the back of the killer. Then a shiver went down my spine. As I realized the killer was death itself. I turned around, and sure enough, the woods were filled with killers, monsters. It all looked towards me, seething. 

>It was urgent. But I didn't give up. I immidiately got up into a Colossus. A giant technological machine that spewed laser beams. But it wasn't enough. I immidiated reached my hand out and created duplicates of them. They kept coming as fast as we were killing them. We were able to hold them at bay, but it was an eternal battle. I imagined creating a building with a permanent laser around it. Then I realized I had to become a new being to overcome this. I turned into an energy being. I sent a beam out in all directions. The enemy was defeated. 

And then tonight, I had this one:

>Tonight I was at a big building, like an amusement park, with my family. We found this fun almost magical thing you could buy. They were little cards of different colors. When you took one and burned it, you could breathe it in. 

>When you did that you went one of a few ways. One was a blissful colored experience. There were some others. But then there were one that was a storm. The more you took, the worse the storm became. However it actually happened, just locally. The storm really happened. 

>Many things happened that night. But one night we took too much. My sister tried a tiny bit without telling us. She was on top of a building, we all were. Suddenly it started blowing. She took her hand of the rails to try to explain herself. The wind almost blew her off the building. My sister ran over to her. Tried to hold her before she went over the edge. Couldn't hold. My father reached them in the last second and pulled them both back from the ledge, but using his self as counter-weight, thereby throwing himself off the ledge. 

>He landed on some wire, he wasn't dead yet. But something else happened. I can't remember why. Oh wait, I think a few of the rest of us had already taken some. And unlike my sister those were bigger breaths. Terrible storms. One in particular was bad. I can't remember why, but it was like he was my brother (which I don't have). On the way in, right before his storm started, I think I locked him in a door so his storm wouldn't take off inside the building. As we went back, I had a flash of hope about seeing him cold and shivering but alive. But when we came closer I saw he wasn't, he was frozen to death in the little room I had left him.

I was terrified while on the boat that we were be killed, but luckily we made it back to the harbor in time and I got off he boat quickly. I met with a very very good friend from middle school (we’re still very close) who was about to get on the boat and I stalled just in case something were to happen. I heard something and told her to run and immediately the boat exploded and sank to the bottom. We were about 15ft away and just barely missed the explosion. I went to the dock and stood there screaming “WHY ARENT ANY BODIED COMING UP TO THE SURFACE?! WHERE IS EVERYONE?!” I was very concerned. I felt really really sad.

Idk why I’m so plagued by this dream, but I’d love to have some help understanding if it means anything. Thank you all so much!",top,"Exploding Boat, Escaping Death",3.0

I had a relatively disturbing dream the other night. I will mention I am a female in college who plays soccer.

The dream began with me walking around. I ended up jumping off of something and breaking my femurs and shins. Somehow I was still able to walk with out much pain but my mother took me to the doctors anyway. The doctor told my mother and I they had to amputate both my legs and that they could not be saved. They gave me a day to think about the procedure considering I protested the surgery. Mind you I was still able to walk! I spent my free day walking around carefully and came across some friends. Towards the end of the day I collapsed and my legs could no longer function. I ended up back at the doctors and they brought me to a creepy basement where they wanted to do the procedure. There were saw looking tools next to the table and blood stains on the floor. They turn on the lights then the place looked slightly more appealing. I asked the doctor if I would be put under they said no! Needless to say I was very concerned. I then asked if they were going to take me to the hospital after the proceduer, the answer was no. They then gave me some medicine via needle that would numb my legs so I would not feel them. They began the procedure and I could feel the pushing and pulling of the tools. I could also feel my body rocking back and forth. I woke up at this point. I fell back asleep and the dream continued. I now had prosthetic legs and could walk around but it wasn’t the same. My feet were plastic. I remember thinking one day I might be able to run but I could never play soccer again. For some reason I was also relieved that my ankle wouldn’t hurt me anymore. 

I think there is more to this dream aside from the thoughts on athletics. I’m not sure what to make of my dream. I was very unsettled when I woke up from my dream believing I no longer had my legs.

So I look up at the score board and see my team is up 99-0, so as I am thinking to myself ""Why are we even playing anymore"" the other team turns into grim reapers and starts to decapitate my teammates.

When I was in high school, I had this sort of mentor relationship with a teacher. It was borderline inappropriate. It was never sexual, it’s just that it was becoming more of a personal friendship than a student-teacher thing. I’ve never had a father figure or positive male role model, and he was just there to listen in a way other teachers weren’t. Nothing really bad happened, I just graduated and we never really talked again. He did give me a mug he made in his studio though.

Anyway. I haven’t seen or heard from or thought about him since I graduated. But last night I had this dream where I went to this house I didn’t know. It was apparently his. And apparently I was living with him for some reason. He was planning something for his wife’s birthday, and he was trying to get me in on it because it was a big surprise scheme. But I was really really sick and I didn’t want to, but he didn’t know I was sick. And so he kept getting angrier and angrier at me until he finally just blew up at me. I don’t remember much of the dream after that.

I just know I was fuzzy about the dream all morning until I opened the cabinet and saw the mug and had a flashback of that big part of the dream and I was overcome with this intense emotional hurt. Like it literally took everything I had to not throw the mug through the window.

0.0,8uflh9,6.0,2.0,"I am now sitting outside on my porch. I just woke up from a terrible dream. Apperently I screamed while dreaming and as I did I slowly woke up. I remember my dream very well. I'll tell you how my dream went.

I was in the attic of a house. The house has been in my dreams before. I have never been to the house in real life but it reminds me of a house from a childhood friend of mine. It has some similarities. The attic was also my bedroom. It had my bed, a TV, and strangely enough multiple security camera's hanging in my room. One which was located on the inside of the tv and pointed towards the outside of the tv. So basically it was pointed at me but it was located behind the glass of the tv.

I then went downstairs and talked with some good female friends of mine that I no longer have much contact with in real life. We talked outside in front of the house. It felt nice talking to them again. Then suddenly an ambulance rushed towards us and stopped at my neighbours house (remember I have never been in this house so I don't know the neighbourhood and have never seen any other houses). There were multiple people stepping out of the ambulance. They all lined up and looked towards the neighbours house. Me and my friend kept watching. One of the people, an older man, went towards the door and ringed the bell. No one answered. I thought the house looked quite old and was covered with multiple newspapers. The man then stood in the front garden and looked towards the line of people from the ambulance and said nothing. His left ear faced the house. I had the idea that they had to deliver something. It was very strange.

Suddenly some sort of very pale, white, bald man with a huge smile on his face. drops a newspaper that covered the window next to the door and starts laughing at everyone. He is in the house. I was scared a lot. The people from the ambulance as well. Me and my friend decided to talk to each other later. 

Some time passed (don't remember) and I went to my bedroom in the attic. I put a towel over my tv because I was afraid the white man would appear in my tv or something at night. As i turned of the lights and was trying to sleep (inside my dream) I saw something on the security camera screen. It was the camera inside the tv that was showing on screen. A white hand was trying to remove the towel from the tv. I immediatly put on the lights and the white man was in front of me, almost naked, in my room, crouched in front of the tv, pulling down the towel, saying something about not liking It, and started crawling through my room. He crawled on the walls and I was very scared and started to panic. I could not breath. Then I noticed that the white man had some sort of dog with him that stood still in the middle of my room. The dog was also pale white but did not have a face. The white man came crawling towards me. 

While all this happened I started screaming in real life. My dad came to me and asked if everything was alright. Now I am sitting outside, writing this in tears. I have to get up in 2 hours but I won't sleep anymore. I am afraid that the dream will continue, I have had that experience before with other dreams.

-Me and my dad were driving on a congested road. He bumped against the side a bit, and then I chastised him to be careful. We get to a gas station late at night, and then, two men pull up, shoot him as he's filling the gas, and they drive off. He dies.


-I was standing in the kitchen of my home with my mom. She was talking bad about my dad, something apparently related to an issue from long ago, and he was on some foreign business visit.

FEMALE: ""Between this time and that one, everything's changed, but he's still the same.""


MALE: ""The reason these problems have happened is because everyone looks for something wrong blatantly, rather than letting it come to them.

I just had an extremely strange dream where I cut my own penis off in front of my best friend in a ritualistic and furtive manner. I had known him for about 5 years in this dream, however in real life, there exists no analogue for this person. I say ritual because the act took place in a bathroom lit with various candles with some occult writing upon the walls. I remember feeling stressed in the dream about doing this in a manner that kept him from knowing I did it, although the significance of that eludes me. The ritual conluded with a chant of some sorts in some language that I don't know (I did recognize that it was some sort of Romantic language via the way it handled sentence structure, but it wasn't obvious which it was). With a swift slice of a pocket knife, I held half of my cut penis in my hands. No blood poured out of it and I felt no pain from doing this. I left what was apparently my best friend's apartment and I started to make my way to my own home, still holding half of my penis in my hand. I passed what seemed like a nearly infinite amount of construction sites. Nothing, it seemed, was properly built. People who noticed my disembodied organ were obviously appalled, but when they noticed it, I felt a sense of both overwhelming affirmation and anxiety. The more people noticed it, the harder the nub that remained of my penis in my pants got and the harder the rest of my disembodied penis in my hand got. By the time I got home, I was so sexually aroused that I basically threw myself upon my girlfriend in the dream, which, again, there was no real-world analogue for.. 

Here's where things get really strange. In front of her, I pulled down my pants and put my penis back on. This was much to her shock, but she still agreed to have sex. I finished, but I didn't ejaculate semen. I ejaculated what seemed like an inky black substance, and when it met her flesh, her flesh began to rot. This rot spread to the rest of her body, and as it did, my body began to dissolve as well. However, in my case, my body dissolved into a pile of sand, starting from the tip of my penis and ending at my eyes. I felt all of this. I heard her scream as she melted into a black tar, but I couldn't scream out, as when I attempted, all that came out was sand and hot wind. We sat as a pile and a puddle in our home for what seemed like an hour before my best friend opened the door with his penis, severed in the same way mine was, in his hand. This was when I woke up.

Somebody else might have prompted this decision, but I can't remember now. I took the frog up the street towards the pond in our subdivision. There was an area without houses there, which is different from waking life. So I put the frog down and it began to hop away but then I saw a mean looking toad probably the size of my head or so and it was going after the little frog. It ate it and I was very upset so I threw a rock at the big road and I hit it right on top of the head. Then I went home and down to the patio. There was an really lush garden there full of colorful flowers which is different from waking life.

You know those dreams where you take a mystical journey? This one was something like it. The whole world was devoid of life. I recall walking through arid deserts and flying over mountains, wondering what happened. I knew I had to confront a dark presence \(for lack of a better word\) that turned the world to this.

On my way I travelled through a cave and discovered a few tombstones. The names on it were unfamiliar. Hidden behind the tombstones I found a cache of useless trinkets that I couldn't reach. Do you remember those gag gifts that disappear in a drawer somewhere when the novelty wears off? That's the feeling those trinkets gave me.

Eventually I reached the lair of the dark presence, an enormous crater that reached far into the earth. As I slowly descended along its edge, a feeling of dread made my stomach churn. At one point, I went so far down that even the sun couldn't reach me, and the darkness became more and more oppressive.

At the bottom, I discovered a set of stairs leading down a pitch black hole. I entered the lair. And the feeling was... Comforting. Not at all dark. It felt familiar. Like revisiting your old neighborhood, or the house you grew up in.

At the end there was a vision. A person who I value deeply destroys something I took great effort to make. It's like tending to a flower\-filled garden for many years, until someone levels it and pours concrete over it because 'it looks better'. It was the worst possible thing that could have happened by someone you trust. I felt anger, but most of all, disbelief.

Not entirely sure what to make of it. Writing it down makes it more easy to digest, though.",top,"A descent, a journey",3.0

The dream is never about the killings though, it's always just me going through my day normally, but overwhelmed with guilt and torment about all the innocent people I've murdered. I vow to never do it again, and wish that I never did it. The whole dream feels so real too, that when I wake up, I'm body slammed with relief that none of it ever happened. But then recently I had a dream that was the all the same scenario, but instead of killed a bunch of people, I raped a bunch of people. And for every dream, my number of victims is 8 for some reason.

Now to clarify, I have no interest whatsoever in killing, raping, or hurting anyone. I don't even think about it that much. \(Of course, death is always somewhere on my mind, like most others, but never rape\). I've been psychologically evaluated throughout my life because I have depression. But no one, professional or not, has ever had the thought that I'd do anything to really hurt anyone. I can't tell if this is normal or not. I hate having the dreams largely because of the extreme guilt and pain I feel throughout the dream, and after the relief wears off when I wake up, I realize what a fucked up dream I had where I did horrible things.

I could barely make out an outline of a man , who i thought was my old theatre director from like the 4th grade. I still seem him quite often to this day and he's one of my favorite teachers. then I felt a different presence in the room that made me scared. as if someone was around the corner near the printers that I couldn't see. i asked my old teacher ""how will he come for me? am i going to be ok?"".as i fumble for a light switch, which I don't even remember where they are in that room. then I could feel my eyes shut. I tried to open them but I couldn't. my old teacher began to speak as if reading from a book. He said ""whatever you do don't look him in the eyes. and if you do be warned."" its the voice of the teacher I thought it was,  confirming my suspicions. almost immediately after he said that an outline of a face flashed like lighting but with no thunder and quickly faded. after that my teacher said ""now that deaths got a good look at you, he likes you and will follow you."" in a panic I say ""what do you mean, and where are the lights?!"" its always been a childhood belief of mine that light could drive away evil spirits. I fall to my knees because I was walking around for the light switch cannot see, my eyes still won't open.

I was finally able to open my eyes and I looked out the glass wall between the office and the hallway. and nothing was different , just the same shadow figure but this time sitting in the chair closest to him. with what i thought was a book on his lap. and the dark hallway adjacent to the office exactly as I remember it. then i started shaking and when i awoke. my dog was next to me scratching himself which was causing my body to shake at the exact same tempo as I was in my dream. plus I was breathing heavy too, and the patter of my breathing didn't skip a beat from dream to IRL. idk what all this means but something is telling me its got to do with my graduation. my aunt is a psychologist so I will contact her and her what she thinks as well

He knows that I really like him but he is also not gay so he just kind of ignores anything beyond basic friendly conversation material. He is also a senior and graduating in a few weeks so there is no real possibility of a relationship there. The other character in my dream is my father, he is very intoxicated in the dream but isn't usually in real life.

The dream is kind of fuzzy at the beginning but it is late at night and I am in the car with my dad and were just going out to get something at the store. He is speeding and swerving and laughing at my feared reactions. We are pulling up in the parking lot to the store and the guy I really like just so happens to be walking to the entrance. My dad is making fun of me for being scared of his driving and I wave to the guy who waves back and smiles. My dad notices and said something along the lines of ""is your friend scared of my driving to?"" and he tried to jokingly hit him. My dad ends up running over the guy. I watch his body get crushed and I feel completely hopeless.  I start uncontrollably screaming, I run out of the car to see him dying and twitching on the ground. I pick his head up with my arm and hold him tight. All i could do is cry on his dying body while my dad is laughing like a robot in the background.

The next day at school is completely normal. Everyone knows he is dead and nobody cares. Some people make fun of me for caring and others joke that I was the one that killed him. I feel hopeless again. I have had violent dreams in the past far worse but this: I just accidentally killed someone I love. I have the image of his dead dream body burnt into my eyes in real life.

I called my mom to see what was going on, she came but didn't believe me until the cabinets started shaking in front of her. Then it became more violent than ever.

I dreamt that I was a 16 year old girl living in the deep south. I was helping out two men who ran a local moving business. They were helping a young, short, single Mexican immigrant mother and her two children move into an old farmhouse. We were just moving boxes out to the front of the farmhouse porch from the truck of the guy in charge - a tall muscular man with a beard. He seemed like a nice guy, kind of a southern dudebro but nothing the matter with that. The other guy had a car (kind of weird for a moving business, just a pickup truck and a car?) and he was smaller, quiet, and not friendly.

So we were finishing up moving all their boxes and the two kids, a little boy and his slightly older sister - they must have been around the ages of 5 and 9 maybe - went out to the house and were sort of exploring the outsides of it, the porch, the bushes, etc. The mother, who was a very small woman, possibly having dwarfism, was going to get out of the car but was somehow prevented from doing so by the quiet man. The guy with the beard then told me to go over to where her kids were and trick them into getting back into the car. They were planning to abduct them for some reason.

I was afraid and walked over to where the two kids were sort of playing under the porch. I stood in front of them and then turned around and looked at the men in the vehicles and started shaking my head and crying. I put my arms out in a protective way, still shaking my head, and started begging them to just leave us here. The kids realized something was wrong and were just watching in confusion and fear. I begged the two men to start driving and not stop until they were far way, and we would never say anything.

The guy with the beard looked like he was angry, but this was more trouble than it was worth. So he gave me this weird smile and held up his arms as if to say, ""Oh well!"" Then he got into his truck and started it up. The smaller, quiet man didn't like this turn of events but followed the other guy's lead. As they were driving off, I noticed that the mother was now in the passenger's seat of the quiet man's car - she was in the middle of changing her clothes from a dress to a pair of pants and a shirt but didn't have her shirt on yet. Anyway, I started motioning to her to jump out of the car and run over to us. She saw me doing that and jumped out and made a run for it. I went toward her because I saw the man getting out of his car to come get her (and maybe the kids now too).

He didn't go straight for us, instead he started walking over to a small shed where there were some random tools and objects on the porch of it. It had a small open wooden porch that looked kind of new. I think he was going to grab one of the tools and hurt us with it. So as he was walking toward the shed in determination, the mother and I just ran straight at him and somehow I had a superhuman strength where I just kicked him in the head hard enough to make him fall face forward onto the porch. It stunned him badly enough to where I could lift him up and slam his head onto the porch a few times. He was now unconscious. He fell right into some weird wooden box on the ground, possibly something meant to carry produce in, not a coffin at all but it was now functioning as one because I lifted my foot up and slammed it into his skull, which caved in. The mother was watching, ready to help if she needed to.

So now the guy was dead and the other guy with the beard had already driven off. The kids were watching from under the house's porch several feet away. Just as we were about to calm down and figure out what to do about the abduction we'd avoided and the murder I'd committed, a truck started driving on the road right next to us and saw us standing there, a teenage girl, a short woman without a shirt on, and a dead man in a large wooden box. The truck slowed down and we ran toward it, asking for help.

In the old pickup truck were two old country boys, one of them much older and resembling and overweight Willie Nelson with one long gray-white braid and a younger man (maybe in his 40s) with brown balding hair and a pot belly. They jumped out and ran over to the dead guy. The old man with the braid was shocked and a tear came from his eye. He started to say, ""He's dead..."" but then his face hardened and he looked up at us and said, ""But you did what you had to do.""

0.0,8d3p2p,3.0,3.0,"There are actually two dreams. They happened within days of each other.

These dreams have stuck with me for ages and ages. I must’ve been... about 16 when I had them. I’m 20 now. 

The first dream was that I woke up in my bed at night. My door was cracked open, which it should not have been as I sleep with the door closed at all times. I heard shuffling and became very frightened and sat up against my headboard. 
A man came into my room, and I realized it was my father (I’ve never met him, I’ve just seen pictures). His skin was grey and had all sorts of sores. I was still very afraid but all I’d ever wanted to do was talk to him. So I started to. But he started coughing and he sort of leaned over the foot of my bed and coughed up/vomited nuts and bolts and screws. 
He then turned very slowly and then quickly and inhumanly slinked out of my room and down the hall. It was night so the house was pitch black and I could see him and I was scared as hell. I could just hear shuffling. Then the front door opened and he made his way to a red car and drove off.

A few days later. I have a dream about... or possibly an encounter with... an angel? I know that sounds absolutely insane.
Time plays a factor in this one though which is... so weird. 
I watched the clock as I fell asleep (while I was still awake) the last time stamp I saw was 2:42 AM. I woke up (in the dream) in my bed. The clock said 2:44. I had a sudden desire to go out to the living room. But unlike most dreams, I was in control of my actions. And it all felt so real. 
I went out to the living room. There was a light on in the kitchen and I thought it was so strange that my mother would be up at that hour in the morning. But when I looked in the doorway, I saw a man pass by. Which should scare me; but it didn’t. I felt at peace. I felt curious.
I went into the kitchen and passed him completely, no confrontation because it felt like I knew him already. The clock on the stove said 2:47. I sat at the table and made a drawing.
The man came over he said “You did that. That is amazing.”
I said “Thank you.” And stood up.
I cannot remember his face at all. But he had on a white tank top and grey sweats. Around him was this golden white light like the sun.
He started to weep and he said “I’m going to be there for you.” as he pulled me into a hug.
This hug was strange. Not in a bad way, I appreciated it. It’s just that I never really feel things in my dream; but this hug was warm. I felt skin, I felt cloth, I felt muscle and bone, I felt arms around me, I felt our bodies press. 
I felt his tears fall on my neck and shoulder and wet my shirt.
He said “I know he hasn’t been there for you. But I will be. I will meet you soon, but for now you have to go back to sleep.”
So I said “Okay”. And we stopped hugging and I went to my room and got in bed. And then I woke up in real life. I looked at the clock and it said 2:53 AM.

It was the strangest thing; but no part of it was scary. I felt safe and warm and loved. It’s just so strange how real it was. Was I sleepwalking? ",top,Dream? Or angel? Or what the hell was it?,3.0
0.0,8cxjda,0.0,3.0,"This got longer than I expected, sorry about that! 

I say ""Institute"" because it feels like I'm being given some sort of bizarre aptitude test in these dreams. The first one was a couple months ago and I don't remember much, other then entering a sort of white-walled facility with a large group of people. In the dream, I believed that we all had to be there, kind of like a mixture of a school field-trip and an exam. The ""tests"" were all very different from each other and extremely surreal and bizarre, but I can't remember specifics. 

So last night's dream is much more clear and I do remember a lot. This time, I entered the Institute with my girlfriend. I was familiar with the place like I had done this all before, but she was very nervous. At first I tried to assure her that it was going to be similar to laser tag (no idea why I thought this), and we head down a white hallway and out into an urban parking lot.

The first ""test"" is definitely not laser tag. We were in this parking lot surrounded by brick buildings and a sports field, and in the middle of the lot was a fifties convertible that looked [kind of like this]
(http://theoldmotor.com/?p=156100) red one. There was an old, larger black woman behind the wheel and she had a very Stepford Wives vibe to her. We got in the car and the woman slowly started accelerating toward a brick wall. My girlfriend started to freak out a bit, but I tried to calm her down. The Stepford woman didn't seem to like that we were talking and turned to us with a menacing grin that made me very uncomfortable. We slowly (maybe 15mph) approach the wall until we crash. No airbags, and we might have crashed a few more times before moving onto the next test, but I can't remember vividly.

I just sort of did a dream transition to the next test and was just somehow in the middle of a war torn area. It kind of looked like an open courtyard in the middle of Aleppo, with Middle Eastern looking people living devastated lives in the wreckage. 

My girlfriend was gone at this point, I think she may not have passed the first test. I would also occasionally have these sort of ""out-of-body"" moments where I was watching this happen with total blackness around me, and my immediate family was watching too. These were kind of random and inconsequential so I won't mention them later. 

In the Aleppo setting, I was standing by a family in the street. They were next to an emaciated cow that was tugging at a rotten corpse lying in the debris. It felt like watching a LiveLeak video or something and I was pretty detached to it all, but the cow was eating the body and yanking it around pretty violently.

Eventually the plaza was overtaken by ISIS style terrorists. The family I was standing by was killed and everyone in the area either scattered or died. I was eventually surrounded by men with large rifles, and they forced me to my knees and made me pray with them. I'm an atheist myself but I don't have any negative feelings toward Muslims or anything, I think this test was about my reactions toward war in general? I'm not sure.

The next one was simpler and more pleasant. It was mostly just focused on a tree branch that had these weird little walrus-faced fairies sitting on it. They had tusks but weren't fat, they looked like the fairies from Pan's Labrynth but with weird Walrus faces. Each one was a different pastel color, greens and yellows and purples. A fatter one did show up and landed on a nearby branch, and the branch snapped under his weight. The other fairies started cracking up over it, until a weird moth-spider thing swooped from the sky and tried to snatch up a fairy. They all scattered but I didn't see if any of them got caught.

The whole ""test"" part of the dream had pretty much evaporated at this point. This last ""test"" was just watching two large, bizarre animals interact with each other. One was blueish but I can't remember much else about it other than maybe it was a quadruped? I don't know, but the other one was this orange-gold thing that was the size of a room, but only a bit bigger than the blue thing. It was immensely obese with huge rolls and kind of looked like one of those big, fat Buddhas. It wasn't human though, it had an animal quality to it. The big Buddha was resting on top of the blue-thing, which seemed to annoy the blue-thing. It shook the Buddha off, and the Buddha rolled onto it's back. As it lied down, the Buddha's legs spread open and revealed a giant, puffy vagina. It was sealed up, not open, and looked pretty human. Yeah, I know... It was weird.

Unfortunately that's all I remember. I think there was a little more afterwards but I really can't recall. Throughout the whole thing, I really felt like I was supposed to be seeing these things and that it was a ""normal"" requirement of some sort of test, almost like a driver's license test or something.

Obviously I have no idea what any of this means, but writing it all down was kind of cathartic. If anyone took the time to read this, thank you! I'd love to hear any thoughts you have on what the fuck my brain did last night.",top,"Second dream I've had about this surreal ""Institute""",3.0

Day 1: I had fallen asleep in bed at 6 pm woke up at 1am messed around for an hour or so, ate, and went back to bed at 4 am. I woke up at 6 am. my dream took place in my second sleep. It was the morning of my ACT test.

I don't remember what my dream was initially about but I specifically remember that I was lucid dreaming. I remember towards the end, I had dreamt that I woke up, but I could not move very easily. Every movement took all the strength I had. I remember knowing there were demons all around me but never seeing any. I sat up cursed at them and flipped the bird towards them, laid face down on my pillows, and I fell asleep.I ""woke up"" in the same position and I felt myself being carried/flying by some spirit. I ""fell asleep again"". I finally woke up at 6 am. It took some serious willpower and strength to move (not impossible though).

Day 2: I spent my day relaxing and talking to friends online, dicking around on youtube, and playing video games. Just spending my Saturday being a bum. I had stayed up pretty late and went to bed at 3:00 am and woke up at 5:00 pm

My dream had something to do with getting some girl to go out with me (no one I knew irl, just a random dream person).My ""waking up"" experience wasn't as long as my first one, but I was aware that I was only dreaming of being in the paralysis this time around. I raised my arm, but it felt like I had kettlebells attached to it. I had my phone in my hand and I was trying to turn it on so my screen would turn on, and somehow the light would wake me up. For some reason, I had the idea that if my arm dropped I would fall asleep again and the same cycle would happen. I didn't get the screen on, but I woke up shortly after to my mom calling my name from the kitchen. In both dreams, the room had some things wrong with it (ie. a dresser in the wrong spot, my bed in the wrong orientation, etc.).

I've been pretty stressed lately (what high school junior isn't?) with school, keeping grades up, social life, summer job planning, and leading sports. I'm not sure if that has anything to do with it but I'm just trying to give context.

She rejected me and I was becoming obsessive, running to her for comfort because a lot of negative things that happened in my life. She wanted me to be baptized at her church and stay friends. She was dealing with her own traumatic issues and needed her space too but I couldn't give her that.

Here's the dream as I wrote it down that morning.



It was at a cold overcast beach. There were no shadows, everything was under the shadow of the clouds. It was cold and wet on the beach, like it was sprinkling on and off... the air was cold and wet. A corpse began to walk onto the beach from the ocean. A corpse was walking calmly as if it were still alive, bloated, blue and with seaweed stuck to parts of it. A dead walking man came from the ocean and the background behind him glitched like some kind of corrupted video game. He turned to me once he stood there on the beach and as he turned his head everything behind him turned with his head. 



In several deep voices he said
 


""I am Legion, and wherever I go I move the earth with me."" 



There was a table and a woman resembling a girl that rejected me at the time who i'll call ""A"" She was in a white summer dress and all of a sudden in my voice the corpse was yelling 



""We can be happy! We can be happy!"" 



The corpse went up to her hugging her but grasping her tightly so she cannot escape. As soon as he did the earth around us sunk below sea level and the ocean rose to drown the corpse and the woman. It was clear that years had passed after the water rose. Like a time lapse the sun rose and set and rose and set several times within seconds then stopped. Then there were two corpses, Legion and the woman... She was blue and dead and had seaweed stuck to her, they stood side by side like husband and wife. And there was a young normal human looking boy playing on the beach. 



He was playing under the overcast shadows on the cold beach saying 



""mom! dad! look at me!""



I'm in 3rd person view almost behind legion as he goes up to what appears to be his son. 



""I want to meet my hero!"" his son said 



Legion turned around and returned to the sea.



From off in the horizon came a floating corpse. It hadn't drowned and it wasn't living. It was a bloodied fresh corpse of a baseball player still in uniform. Hovering but like a violent rag doll being thrust through waves towards the beach. The corpse stopped in front of the boy, shaking and spasming like a rag doll... 



You could here legion speaking 



""look at me! I'm your hero!"" As if he was waving a doll in front of the child. As if the only way Legion could think to bring his son his hero was dead. Like some kind of toy he could keep.

It started getting brighter and I had this indescribable urge to get to that light. I just felt like that’s where I needed to go.

After classes on the first day, I go back to a dorm room that isn't my own. It has the few girls who ""I've known for forever"" (their words in the dream). Things get kinda hot and heavy I guess? It just seemed like a few of them wanted me. And I eventually go into the room of one of them. We don't really do anything sexual or romantic though, just play wrestle on the bed and talk. I return to my dorm that night and hangout with my girlfriend. 

At this point I was woken up by my phone, but quickly went back to sleep. 

I'm back into the same dream pretty quick and it's the next day. I'm out walking around campus at lunch and I see a kid go and flip a water switch on a series of pipes, which for some reason could lead to the dorms flooding. I make the executive decision to turn it off, and get called out by a professor. She's, again, a beautiful woman who seems into me. I explain why I did what I did, and she accepts the answer all too readily. I go back to my dorm, and for some reason I'm running incredibly late for my next class. I keep looking for something or finding a reason why I can't leave my dorm, and end up missing a class entirely. I make it to my next one, which happens to be in the same room, and it goes much like the day before. Everyone is interested in what I have to say and its generally a laid back free for all. I do remember slightly an incident with a bird happening in the room, but I don't exactly remember what it was about. After class a couple of the girls who I am close with come back to my dorm room with me to make dinner. My girlfriend is there and the room is soaked. She says the pipe must've leaked somehow and our things are ruined. For some reason this doesn't really bother me, and I say we'll work through it. I sit on a couch and the girls I came in with start climbing on me, joking around, and being flirty. I wasn't being very sexual towards them in return, but I definitely didn't push them away. My girlfriend sees this and is incredibly offended, not even knowing who these girl's are. They explain their relationship with me, and I tell my girlfriend that they know I'm in a relationship with her. She doesn't exactly buy it though. I should mention throughout this whole dream, my girlfriend seemed more of a background prop almost. I did more with the girl's who were my friends than I ever did with her in the dream. Then I wake up.

It was weird, because the girls I was ""close"" with in the dream I wasn't very close with in real life. In fact, they were more in the popular crowd whereas I was not. We were definitely friendly, but not close. The dorm was also quite large and had a full oven and fridge. The almost sexual encounter I had with the girls was definitely tension filled, but I never went through with anything. 

It was extremely vivid, like I said. And I've not dreamed in some time. Any ideas?",top,I just feel like this dream is loaded,3.0

I was telling my wife about how cool the pants were and that the pants came with an old glass liquor bottle. I was screwing around and flipped the glass up in the air behind me and it shattered and although it was a big bottle, yielded more shattered glass than it would have realistically. I went to go get a broom bare footed avoiding visible glass but still getting cut from smaller invisible peices. I went to the kitchen for a broom and received more glass visibly stuck in my hands. Large shards. A man came into my house promptly as i realise glass is in my hand. 

He says: "" i take it you've heard then?""

 I said: ""no, i just accidentally broke glass, what are *you* talking about""

""An important satellite orbiting earth has crash landed and now we're all bankrupt, earth is bankrupt.""

I looked at my hand. Pulled the glass out. The last shard didn't come out gracefully, it pulled my skin which created what looked like a blood blister and i started bleeding profusely.

In the same house, an english speaking asian man cooks me and a friend italian style (ravioli?) food. He is a younger man (early 20s) and challenges me to a brawl in the same room where the broken glass now seems to have disappeared or has been cleaned up. As i square up with him i see peaceful scenery instead of his face, all i see is his mouth and then scenery above it. He hits me several times, feels like gloved hits. I ask him how he is creating the illusion. He tells me to picture a nice place because it messes with your opponents head. I do this, it works, and then he starts showing me YouTube styled VHS videos about how he used to shoot at Justin Timberlake and Emenims house before they were famous. I told him that was very fucked and violent and then decided to gtfo because i felt unsafe and worried now about what i was fed earlier because the guy seemed very malicious.

I lived in the house with my Dad's girlfriend for 2 years after he died, mainly because of the pets (cats and her dog) and to sort out insurance related things.

I am in a long distance relationship for 1 year now, but I am as happy as can be with him and don't want anything to change at all. He completes me and does everything to make me happy.

I am the manager of a company which is quite the stressful job, but I am on a 2 weeks break now. Also I do not have to worry about money because my job pays well. My diet is quite healthy, I do not drink any alcohol and I do not smoke.

I am no ""social person"" at all, I enjoy being alone due to social anxiety. It makes me very uncomfortable being outside or being around strangers. It was worse a few years ago, but my job helps me fight it a bit because I am always around people. It is difficult, but managable.


**The dream**: I found myself in the living room of my parents house, together with my parents (who died 18 and 2 years ago), my siblings and our pets. Everything looked SO real...

The room was quite bright, I guess it was morning and late spring/summer because I could see blooming trees and flowers through the large window. The TV was on, but muted. It showed a news reporter who looked quite serious, but also scared. He moved his lips nonstop. 

My Dad stood near the window and looked outside, my Mum sat on a chair to the right of me, I sat on the sofa and my silblings were to my left. It was very silent; a dark atmosphere. I looked to the TV once more and read the subtitles which said that the world was going to end in about 20 minutes (11:37). I did not really know what to think. My Dad said that he does not believe in stuff like that and went into the kitchen, my Mum started crying.

I went upstairs to my room, switched on my laptop. While the laptop was booting I looked outside the window into my neighbour's garden and admired the very big and beautiful tree right infront of my window (something I have been doing IRL too, I love this tree). 

I kinda forgot about the time. Suddenly, I became very anxious without any reason at all. It was so hard to breathe and I had an immense headache. I looked at the time on my laptop. 11:37. I paniced.

I crawled to the laptop to send a message to my boyfriend who was offline. I texted him on a messenger, the message was: ""I love you so much, you are my everything"". It was extremely difficult to write this message, I felt almost paralyzed.

Suddenly, the pain instantly went away and my room turned quite dark. It was still morning, but the sky was dark grey. It was windy outside. I was scared.

I ran downstairs into the kitchen to find my terrified family. We went into the living room to the large window to see what was going on outside.

The houses in our neighbourhood looked like ruins, as if nobody had lived in them for several decades. The sky was a sea of black, purple and red clouds. The colours bled into each other. We heard screams of people far away.

We went to the front door and walked on the street to see what was happening to our neighbours. Everything was a chaos. Every house looked like it was close to break down, except for our house which for whatever reason was perfectly fine. My parents looked at each other, then looked at us and told us they were going to stay here and they won't try to run because this is the end and we cannot do anything against it. We should stay here and die together as a family.

We stayed on the street, suddenly my Dad ran to the other side into our neighbour's house because his best friend used to live there. Right as he left the house again, the house broke down. It was so close, but it did not seem to bother him at all. He walked back towards us and just said ""he is dead"" without any emotions in his voice. We went back into our house, into the kitchen.

The kitchen somehow changed. It had very large windows now, just like the living room. And the walls turned red.

We were terrified, suddenly we heard noises outside similar to a firework, but much much louder. We could see a fire in a nearby forest, there was lava coming out of the ground (far away).

I looked outside the other window to see the big beautiful tree of my neighbour on fire as well. I thought ""Good bye, tree"", when my Dad grabbed our hands and pulled us outside to the car.

We were in the car together and my Dad started driving. I do not know where he planned to take us.

My Mum asked him: ""Why are we running away now? I thought we all were going to die in the house we built together?""

Dad: ""I do not want to die. Death is the thing I fear the most, and I will do everything possible to run away from it as much as I can. Even if that means I will just live 1 second longer. I am scared, I am so scared.""

He started crying (I have never seen my Dad cry IRL), my Mum had tears in her eyes and held her hands infront of her mouth, quietly whimpering.

I looked back, just to see a giant explosion behind us. It was catching up to us very fast. I felt anxious again like when everything started at 11.37. The immense headache, the feeling of being paralyzed. I could not breathe.

Then I was stuck. Everything stopped. The explosion was about to hit our car, then everything stopped moving as if someone hit the pause button. I could move. I was scared, I started crying, I felt anxious, my headache was about to kill me. I heard people screaming from all sides. Those were the most terrifying screams I have ever heard. It was so loud. Everything got louder and louder, it felt like the screams came closer. I was so scared, I WANTED to die to make it stop.




Then I woke up, I started crying.

Usually nightmares like these do not affect me. I think about them and then forget them during the day, but I cannot forget this one. I am thinking about it all the time and I can't make it stop. I am feeling anxious and scared.

I have no idea what that dream was all about, why I had it and what it means. I am totally clueless.

For years now I have had a recurring nightmare about the same figure and I cannot work out what it is regarding.

The dreams have varied in location but the context of the dream is always similar and there are always two scenarios. 

1. There will be a room I have a sense of dread about it will be dark and in my dreams when I enter the room I sense something else in the room. Slowly a hooded cloaked all black figure will appear and before I know it the figure is beside me and will grab me. Me dreams always end with the figure trying to choke me and my scream wakes me up.

2. In the second scenario there will be a wardrobe or cupboard slightly ajar and I will be in bed. The same figure will put his shadowy fingers around the door and slowly push it open and start crawling towards me. I will be paralysed and unable to move. The figure will crawl up onto the bed and start choking me whilst their hood is touching my face. Again my screams in the dream are the trigger to wake me up.

So I dismiss it and try my phone flashlight; it does turn on, but it doesn't emit any light. I get to where I'm trying to go, and turn on the light, and it's still mostly pitch black.

The location has varied overtime. When it first started, I was about 4 or 5, and the dream was a lot more common back then. It started out always happening in my old house, with my old bedroom and all of that, and that happened until I moved. Then it was in that house for the next while.

It's not really a huge deal, and I'm not superstitious (but I am a little stitious). If anybody wants to tackle it, they can!

I've recently been actively recalling my dreams, and occasionally writing down the events to the best of my waking memory. The one that I had last night was interesting, and I can't really make sense of it; what are the symbols and what is my unconscious trying to tell me. To give some waking life context, I am currently second semester into my PhD program in a state over 1000 miles from family. I recently got married in December. This is the first time I've been out of my parents home, first time living with someone, let alone a wife. I've had a lot of internal issue dealing with these changes; the program is very difficult for me and I feel very much like an outsider, while marriage is equally hard for me to come to grips. I love my wife, as she really is my best friend, but I have a sort of shadow side with a strong lust for other people (of which I've never acted upon). I feel a lot of confusion and guilt over this. Here is the dream:

As best as I can remember, I was somehow in the process of filming an ongoing movie, however I seemed unaware of the prequel that was already made; I seemed equally unaware of the plot or point of the current movie. Instead, I just remember feeling sort of in it, without reason, or even intention. I vaguely remember a scenario in this dream where me and another “actor” of the film visited a store/shop. I do not know if this was a scene we were filming, or something we were doing outside of filming. Either way, we go to this store/shop and I remember a female there; I remember us showing signs of attraction to each other, but cannot really put a face to her. After, a strange series of events, which just seem blurry to me, we ended up on the roof of the store/shop. I’m not sure who she was in the context of the dream (shop owner?) or what she represents beyond the context of the dream, but we then kissed. Strangely, after the kiss she seemed either upset, or even displeased, and left. I was asking her to come back, but she just continued to leave and that was it. 

The next thing I remember, I was confiding in another “actor” that I had no idea what this film was about, and I had not seen the original prequel to the current film. He seemed shocked, and told me that I was actually in the prequel film; he couldn’t understand how I did not know or remember that. The scene is blurry to me now, but I think we were sitting on steps of a plane entrance; the plane did not seem to be functioning, and we didn’t have intentions of flying it. The surroundings almost seemed like a junkyard or broken train yard (although we seemed to be sitting on the steps of a plane entrance). Abruptly, members of my family, and even long-term childhood friends just showed up. I have no idea why or what they were doing there, but I got off the steps and approached them. I don’t particularly remember the mood of the interaction (whether it was sad or happy), but then the dream skipped ahead and I was in some home with all of them there. Interestingly, there was a certain family member or friend that I do not recall from my real life (outside of the dream), and he appeared to be mentally/physically challenged. He could still walk and talk, but I don’t really remember him saying anything. At some point, I carried him on my back all the way down a flight of stairs, and there was more family at the bottom of the stairs. In the dream, it seemed like this was the right thing to do, but I cannot remember why. I don’t remember anything else.

(It has been a year and that is why the picture is in my phone twice). My sister doesn’t seem to care much and goes back to her life. I check my phone again and the pictures are gone. It is now night time in my dream I am in my room and a man comes. He is preparing something. I do not know him but I know that he is preparing for a demon to come and kill me. As he gets closer to being ready I can feel that the demon is getting closer and closer. My death will soon come. Then I decide to stop just sitting and go get someone to help me. I run across the hall to my mothers room and tell her what happening. She acts like nothing is going on (even goes to the bathroom). Once she gets out she tell me she thinks the man is one of my brothers friends (I only have one brother in real life in the dream I had 2). I start telling her everything about the pictures and when I look across the hall I can see a long black figure with a pointy nose sitting on my bed waiting for me. Every time I look to check he is in a different position just waiting for me to come back. Then I wake up.

After a few days of thinking about this dream I start researching the picture that was on my phone. I found the it’s very similar to the devil card from a tarot card deck.

0.0,7sutl4,1.0,3.0,"So here it goes. Ever since I was younger, I would have recurring dreams about possession. It's always a female, such as my mom or cousin, and never males. They always take place within the same dreamscapes, as well have the same vibes to them which would be that the person who is possessed is either after me or just there in some sort of fucked up situation. Well, recently, I've been having more and more of these dreams, and most of the time they are about my cousin. Funnily, I had mentioned these dreams to her and told her how its always her that gets possessed or some female, and she told me that when she was in the 6th grade (she's 18 now so been a good 6-7 years or so) she messed with a Ouija board. Now, i've been having these fucked up dreams since about that time, and before then it would be subtle shit. Im not sure if there is a correlation between my weird ass dreams and the Ouija board use, but its just weird shit lol... Its so fucking odd. A recent dream I had was my cousin and her mom being possessed, and its always the same shit. They know that I know they are possessed, and they fuck with me while everyone else in my dream is blind to it and relate it to them having a mental breakdown. I end up calling a priest and getting the fuck out of the house, and they end up chasing me because they are pissed. Fucked up thing is though that in my dreams, I would get this paralyzing shock and flashes of really hellish and demonic shit in my vision for a split second and that would indicate when someone who is possessed is near. What was weird though was that in this dream, the possession was more like a sickness. Random people were getting possessed and I knew. It was fucking weird... The most recent dream I had I saw my dead friend as well, but I knew he was dead in my dream and only thing was he was just walking about zombified, literally brain dead, just a husk walking and when I would try to acknowledge him, he would flail in confusion. It was so fucked. After seeing my dead friend, I remember it cut to me scaling some sort of hill/mountain, and ended up sliding down the hill and landing on an ancient looking platform with weird shit carved into it. I noticed odd boxes and in the boxes there were a bunch of statues that looked resembled pazuzu (demon). After realizing that shit I jumped off the platform onto a weird graffiti covered bus and saw some lady with a weird looking face with a witch-like nose/mask wearing a black shroud/robe waving a staff around like some sort of fucking evil witch lmfao. I ended up running and hopped into a vehicle that was somehow connected to my conscious and was able to track everything I saw, and would teleport to whatever area I wanted.

There was a little shrine, with a portrait of the Virgin Mary. I stopped there for a moment before proceeding into the forest. Once I was inside the forest, I did nothing but run around out of pure joy. I just ran around without ever getting tired, totally euphoric just to be there. This went on for hours.

I’ve been having the same, or at least similar dreams fairly regularly now, and I’m not sure what they mean. They’ve subsided a little as of late, but I still get them about once a week.

A little background on myself: i’m a teenage male who’s never had anything worse than a few stiches in my head. The person who the dreams about is a friend of mine who I had a crush on about four years ago.

The dream is of me being at a friends house, usually to help her with some garden or yard work. That part of the dream is always the same. Then she takes me up to her room to “show me something” at this point she always knocks me out somehow, usually with a baseball bat. Then I come too to find that I’ve been tied to her bed and am being sexually assisted and raped. This is where the dream changes. Sometimes I just wake up in a cold sweat. Other times black out again and wake up to find my genetalia have been removed. Other times her mother or brother comes in and police are called. Sometimes I break free. If police are contacted they usually don’t believe my case (as female on male rape is rarely taken seriously). And they only do believe my case in the rare version of the dream where my genitals are cut off, I bleed to death, and then first-person watch my friend get prosecuted for rape, mutulation, and murder.

So, obviously this is a disturbing dream, and it makes me feel uncomfortable whenever I’m around her. Recently she told me she was a masochist, and that caused a resurgence in the dreams. I haven’t the faintest idea what my subconscious is trying to tell me. If it’s that I can’t trust my friend, I knew that already as she’s kind of manipulative in that gossipy kind of way.

Last night It was just me going about my day, I was wearing a well fitted suit and was walking across a city street.

It started to downpour as the window to the vehicle slowly opened and the muzzle of a gun emerged. 


I saw it and had plenty of time to do something but I just stood there. I was shot a number of times and dropped to my knees in what felt like a progressively deepening puddle around me.

It doesn't matter to them at all, like they don't want to go, or got to go already. But for me it's like it's my life's purpose to go there. 

If this is relevant, the park usually includes a big rollercoaster (too big and crazy for sane people to want to ride, but I do) or an awesome water ride,  sometimes includes a market where you can buy really cool things (a lot of my dreams involve shopping, too), and often includes a hotel.

Just a pet theory, but once I was on a park and noticed a very young toddler trying to keep up with it's parents. The parents were a little distracted so they were walking a bit faster than the toddler could. The toddler was there, doing the run of his life while the parents and everyone around were walking pretty much nonchalantly

I feel this could be the childish memory that feeds dreams of running and getting nowhere, or running really slow. It would explain why this dream is so universal: everyone was once a toddler trying hard to keep up on an adults world. Also, the feeling of this experience may be strong enough to leave a mark, and the emotions on running in place dreams seem to be similar to that one of the toddler.

In my family, alcoholism is common, so I know that I do have some sort of alcoholism gene in me. I had a brother who passed away 3 years ago from a heroine overdose. Last night I had a dream that utterly terrified me.

I recall being in an empty room. I felt very very anxious. I felt anxious in the same way I feel anxious when I feel unproductive from not doing homework or not having anything to do. It was also as if someone was urging me to do something. In front of me, a handful of opioid pills (little round flat pink pills labeled ""OPIOID"") appear, and I feel very pressured to ingest one despite knowing how bad it is.

I take a pill and push the other ones aside. When I take the pill, I start to feel extremely alert and sensitive. However, I also feel my heartbeat racing. In fact, my heart is racing so face (I even had a lucid moment where I attempted to measure how face it was going), and it must've been going over 150 bpm atleast. I honestly felt like my heart was about to stop or I was going to have a heart-attack. 

I woke up seconds after that, and it took me awhile to be able to recall it after a nice breakfast. I had a similar dream a long time ago (perhaps half a year ago) where I took a substance akin to LSD, and I hallucinated. I saw geometric shapes everywhere, and my heart was beating fast, but not nearly as fast as it did in that dream (not even close). Like before, I've never taken LSD or an opioid before. Wtf is going on?

Now, as far as I am concerned, with my limited knowledge, it seems to me that I can experience something in a dream as long as I can conceive of and understand what the action is. For example, I believe that despite never taking lsd, I know and understand what it does. Therefore, I can experience it. This is strange though, because I don't see anywhere on the internet about dreams where it says that you can experience anything as long as it's an understandable construct.

Really odd dream last night and I wondered what your take on it might be.

About me - I'm 36 M from the UK married with two kids. Reasonable salary. 

So the dream:

I had a new tech job. I arrived at what appeared to be a nice night club. 8am and people around me are drinking whisky. I'm trying to find some coffee.  

I get told to go wait in the pool. so I get in and paddle about a bit. A guy comes over and tried to drown me. He almost succeeds, but stops suddenly and then sits on the side of the pool. I then compose myself, swim over to him and punch him in the face 3 or 4 times, he is now unconscious. none of the other employees seem at all bothered by or even noticed what just happened. 

Next thing I know were sat in an auditorium playing 'bingo' except that this time you hold your ticket in the air, and the person who can grab the most tickets wins the prize. A mass brawl breaks out, and at that point I woke up. 

Many Thanks

-I'm with my family in the kitchen, my dad announces my uncle has passed away. I start crying, and my brother starts screaming at me for crying, and we get into a screaming match, then I wake up.

-I'm in my dorm room with my dog (in real life, he was put down this summer). I suddenly realize I haven't been feeding him since the semester started, and start to panic. I look at him again and his body is emaciated, then I wake up

-I'm walking along the beach with my friend from college and tell her about the wildlife. I tell her to watch her step, and we look down and the beach is covered in very very small baby animals, they kind of look like chipmunks or something. But they're everywhere, and as we're walking I accidentally step on them. Theres blood all over my feet

-My teeth keep falling out, and every time a tooth comes out, a slug emerges from the hole where my tooth used to be

-Me and my roommate meet these two guys in the lobby of our dorm building. They are older and tattooed. We take them back to our dorm and have an orgy.

**The setting was in my hometown where I don't live anymore and it's like 400 miles from where I live rn.** So it's a beautiful quiet winter evening and I am walking along the sidewalk browsing something on my phone only to be interrupted by a complete stranger.

""Hello, what are you doing?""

It was weird because she came across as nosey at first but a fun kind of nosey, someone who  won't stop asking questions. She wasn't very tall and had a tired complexion which looked very good on her for some odd reason. Her nose had turned red from the cold and she was wearing a worn out long coat that people won't usually wear when they go out. I could tell by her nose (Idk why) that she was Russian or French which is very peculiar because its extremely rare to find one in my country ( not disclosing). I don't exactly remember the conversation we had but I remember that I liked it and I ended up asking where she is from to which she answered, ""Czech Republic"" so I wasn't wrong. She also told me she was struggling to make a living and does small odd jobs. I remember her asking a lot of personal questions about my life to which I usually won't respond in real life but for some reason I told her everything. We ended up exchanging numbers to see each other in future someday (she had a very old keypad type phone). It was obvious at this point that she was struggling financially yet she was so full of life and charismatic, even with a tired complexion and dead eyes she could get you to do anything and answer anything she wants to know. 

The next day I woke up to find out my bag was missing which had like a lot of my clothes in it ( because dreams are weird man). I checked my phone and I had a Multimedia Text message from the girl, it was a picture of my clothes all washed up and folded beautifully. ""I have your bag xoxo, come take it"". I found it creepy and sweet at the same time and I was dying to meet this girl once again so I did. Fast forward to couple of days we became really good friends and we would hangout a lot. She was unlike other people who get bored of doing the same shit again and again in fact with every passing day she became more and more close to me. Everything she did was unpredictable and magical and I loved how she spoke in broken English. She got really close to me in the next few weeks and also got involved in my personal life, I invited her over at my house for dinner with my parents and they all got to know each other. (My parents still live in my hometown but I don't. In my dream I was still living with my parents.) A lot of shit happened irrelevant shit but it wasn't hard to tell that we liked each other a lot. She was gorgeous in a way that only I found her gorgeous and extremely attractive and charismatic. She pretty much changed my life and came in like colors in my otherwise black and white basic life. She was like that funny annoying companion in an RPG that follows you everywhere and helps you out with everything and I loved it.

This is when something woke me up, loud music to be precise and it took me a couple of minutes to come back to reality. I immediately called my mom to ask if I brought a girl over for dinner and she said that I haven't been home in months and asked if I am OK. I didn't want to believe it was a dream because it felt so real. I was so pissed to find out that she doesn't exist, how can someone so perfect and ideal exist. 
All I know that she was from Czech Republic and her name was Ivana and that she doesn't exist or does she? I'll never know.

*I was at my university with some random people and this girl from class. She asked me to start a relationship with her, I told her I was considering such a thing for about a week now and agreed.* 

*Then she leaped at me for a kiss, I ducked at first but when she fell past me I grabbed her arm, swung her around and kissed her when she was on the other side of me. The rest of the night/dream continued us just acting like a standard couple of lovebirds.*

When I woke up it was early so I decided to sleep again, this time we sat on a bird and were flying upwards.

So, I've got a possible interpretation but I am wondering if I could be missing some (symbolic) elements.

I've had a long fear of starting relationships/women/reliability in them because of how my first one ended (and perhaps some upbringing). Recently, however, the idea of atleast dating is starting to appeal to me again and I've actually started thinking about how to actually ask someone out, I have a couple of girls on my mind I'd like to ask. (my first relationship started in an unorthodox manner so I've never had to do that). 

The point is that the girl in my dream is almost like a ""common disnominator"" of them and close to an anima figure for me. Did she appear because of reconcilliation with the idea or could there be more to it?

Some event in the dream has us running, my soulmate is much faster and as we run we make it into a maze of small buildings, think an old Italian village. He sprints around a corner and I've lost him. I can't see him anymore and I round the corner but I hear a door shut. Rather than continue running, for some reason I always go to the door which I find unlocked. I open it and enter a building that is really more like a courtyard with a staircase that ascends to a level which commonly has a garden--that is trying to kill me. I've had this dream before and I'm wary of moving to fast through this place as I know traps are set up everywhere. I ascend the staircase slowly and notice another recurring element. Four dragonish gargoyles with arrowheads barely sticking out ready to impale and kill me. I've been shot by them before and always wake up sweating and even sometimes screaming. I duck down and decide to take a path around the compound, which for some reason is surrounded by water on that side. I am on a dock and I make it to the end. A vast ocean lies on one side and a wall on the other. I wake up. 

So that's basically the dream. It always goes to the same building and same sort of odd outside layout even though it should be indoors. Nothing about the place is familiar to me. This time I believe was the first case in which I didn't die. Sometimes the arrows kill me, or a trap waiting on the next floor or staircase does sooner or later. Usually it feels like a nightmare and I'm panicking, but this time around I was tranquil and the setting was very peaceful, though I was still sad I had lost my soulmate. Anyone who can help me interpret this I would very much appreciate it. I don't think it's just a coincidence that I've had this dream at least 5 times (in about a timespan of five years).

0.0,7086yx,0.0,3.0,"I'm a pretty big dream enthusiast. Spent much of my depressed teenaged years pinning down lucid dreaming without knowing the term. My father mentioned to me at a very young age(maybe in the range of 6-10) that I had the power to change my dreams like Wile E. Coyote could pull down a screen in front a mountain and make a tunnel to walk through. Life has never been the same. Fell out of really putting effort into it and now they come at random. Nightmares aren't really part of my life, but sometimes I get awkward feeling dreams even when they seem completely bland.....

I've recently gone through a rough patch in my marriage. Court, custody, the whole 9....things are about a month into settling and reversing. He was a complete pot head(not anti drug, but his abuse made life basically groundhog day)....clean now. Acting pretty on top of things even though we are in a huge financial mess now.

My dreams are usually fleeting if they don't feel off or have some sort of outright significance, but last night I had 3 separate dreams that all had the same theme(?).

The first one was me driving in a Jeep(husbands car of choice that he sold a while back due to hardship) alone on a mountain road. Some how got sucked up in a reverse waterfall and sat at the top of what felt like a flooded building with Rodger from American Dad(I haven't watched American dad in ages, but I did binge the declassified alien case files for a bit last week....)..All in 3rd person until Rodger spun to the ""camera"" and made eye contact with me, lecturing me on water conservation(I live in CA and am only just hitting late 20s. My whole life that I can remember has included water conservation....I turn the shower off to wash my hair as a habit). Part of the dream was also spent trying to get a hold of my husband with terrible reception

Second dream was set is some weird medieval time. Long damp stone staircase leading into a hallway with 2 ""windows"" cut in the ston that were bubbling furiously. On the other side was a lake, and I was meant to swim through the window and join in on some summer camp tournament type thing going on up top/in the lake. I can't swim well and am not fond of putting my head underwater, so I opt for the staircase leading outside and to the side of the lake instead. Complete change of scenery; sunshine, people(there was a ""guard"" in full armor on a step under ground, but still a flip in atmosphere), and the fact I came the way I did changed nothing to anyone around me and I was encouraged to check out the ""windows"" from the other side, which only bubbled so rapidly to keep the water in the lake(okay) and some dude came swimming trough unharmed.

Third - husband and I are taking a boat to a lake. We can take it to the dock that lowers us in for $1 or we can do it ourselves. We don't know what we are doing and husband insists that $1 is a rip off. At some point we are in the company of the dude that helps lower the bots in. He says our boat doesn't have enough air. Tiny fishing boat turns into kayak with weird rubber joints and inflation plugs. We start blowing it up. Don't think we ever made it to the water before I woke up.

This type of back to back dreaming(I know at least the last 2 happened between my husband leaving for work and my daughter waking up which is only 2 hours) and recall is uncommon for me. I also drank wine the night before, which usually ensures horrible sleep, and I woke up dehydrated and semi achey, so it was def messing with me.

Ugh. It was cathartic just getting it out. Ty if you read this far.

0.0,6yn5ty,2.0,3.0,"Hello, I [24/F] need help interpreting a few dreams that I have had within the last 2 years. I know it's been pretty long but here's the context:

I lost my best friend [F/21 then] to suicide 2 years ago. The twist is, I knew that she was going to take her life. She told me, and having been her friend for a few years I just sort of accepted that she would do it one day. I still struggle with my choice to not have done anything till this day, and will live with guilt and shame for the rest of my life, but part of me believes it had been for her best. For the record, I did not attend her memorial and so the only thing I can hold on to about her death is the text message I received as well as some news articles reporting it.

In the last 2 years, I've dreamed about her, directly or not, five times. The first dream was exactly 30 days after we last spoke (and the day I assumed she died) where she appeared to tell me that she ""wasn't really gone"". I don't remember the exact message but she also said that she'll ""come back"", and told me to ""wait for her"". I of course woke up weeping but attributed the dream to me missing her. Two months later, I got a similar if not the exact same dream. During this period I actually doubted if she really died, having incredulous thoughts about her faking her death, running away with a new identity to take revenge etc. This because I never actually saw her dead body nor attended her memorial, so I guess in a way I still didn't believe it nor accept it.

The next three dreams did not have her appear, but rather revolved around her passing. One dream I had someone asked me if I was okay, and I remember me breaking down in that dream. Another I had her parents pass me an envelope with pictures of her (and maybe a letter, I don't remember). The latest was a few weeks after Chester Bennington's death, I dreamt meeting Linkin Park and telling them how much my best friend was a huge fan of them but has sadly taken her life. Funny thing is, Chester was still *alive* in that dream. I always try to interpret my dreams, and thought these few were just me missing her. I have to admit sometimes I get so busy that I don't think of her, and wonder if these dreams are to remind me of her, to not forget her.

I'm interested to know how you guys would interpret them, particularly the first two. Like does it mean her soul is not at peace? What could she have meant that she's ""not gone""? I'm sorry for the long post, a lot has transpired within the last 2 years and I just want to know that I'm not going crazy or thinking things too far. I have since accepted her death, but think about her a lot still. I appreciate any words you guys have to offer. Thanks in advance.",top,Dead best friend appeared in my dreams,3.0
0.0,6y37yc,6.0,3.0,"I usually tend to keep things like this to myself, especially since this specific dream made me depressed. A little bit about myself, I'm a 27 year old male and like to think of myself as optimistic, a hopeful and cheerful person. Anyway, I'll start from what I remember most vividly.

Its night. I am walking in a field and I could see the stars and moon through the tree branches. Its a nice night to take a stroll down this field, its quite peaceful. As I walk the wind picks up and I am mid conversation with a girl as she holds my hand. I can't make out her face but I know I have feelings towards her. I felt like Ive known her for years. Almost as if she was my significant other. As we walk to what seems to be an abandoned building, my heart races not out of fear but out of happiness. We enter the building and its dark and decrepit, as if it hasn't been tended to in years. Meanwhile as this girl is talking to me she is leading me towards some doors. While this is happening I get this feeling of being followed to which the girl responds 'we are being followed.' A shady figure has been following us since the night began. We run down a hallway and I go through a door and close it behind me. 

When I take a moment to recollect myself, I noticed that I have gone forward in time. Years. I am standing in the open field from the beginning of my dream except now its a wasteland. There is sand everywhere and the trees have all died out, its just a dry barren wasteland. As I walk toward what seems to be the same abandoned house, I get that familiar feeling like when I was with that girl. I was happy. So I chase this feeling and found the abandoned house. I keep going and walk down hallways until I find a door that makes my heart race again, just as if I was with that girl. I want to see her again, so I open the door and close it behind me. 

I am again in the beginning of my dream, only its not a wasteland anymore. The trees are there, the field is not a desert anymore and it begins to rain. I look for shelter and find that same abandoned house, only when I open the door there's a party going on. People are gathered and it looks like a regular social gathering, some of my friends are there and tell me to go and join them so I do. Meanwhile I am looking for that girl, I begin to get anxious and leave the social gathering to go and look for her. I walk back outside and the rain has stopped, its now a wasteland again. There is a black car parked outside and there is a man leaned up against the car smoking a cigarette, I couldn't see his eyes because the sun was reflecting off his glasses. I wasn't afraid because for some reason the man seemed approachable, so I approached him. I wanted to ask him questions, if he had any idea of what was going on. Maybe he had some answers to why these doors kept throwing me around through time. When I finally got close enough to ask him a question the man grinned, put out his cigarette and said “Go.” I don't know what he meant so I just walked back inside the house. I didnt ask him anything. When I walk back in, there is nobody there, its empty. The gathering that was there was gone. So I walk and walk and walk until I find some doors, knowing I will travel through time, I opened it and went through close the door behind me expecting to be back in the beginning of my dream, only I wasn't. When I closed the door behind me I was in another room. I was on the second floor of this abandoned house. There was that same girl from the beginning of my dream. She ran towards me, hugged me and told me not to leave her again. I felt a rush of emotions when she hugged me, it felt so familiar as if I was longing for this moment for years. Then I hear someone running up the stairs, I turn around and see a child run towards me, she jumps and hugs me. I pick her up and hold her, she begins to cry on my shoulder and says “Please don't leave us again.” I couldn't respond to her or say anything, I just held her head close toward my chest and calmed her down. I was happy, I thought I had lost the girl but there she was, and she had a child with her. I don't know who she is or where she came from, I just felt happy knowing I was with them again. I turn to look out the window and I see that man leaned up against the black car smoking a cigarette. The girl look at me and says “You have to leave again don't you?” I said “Yes. I'm sorry.” She smiled at me and held my hand. The little girl squeezed me and said “Promise you'll come back?” I couldn't respond.

I put her down and as I get up, the man from outside is at the door. The door is open and he's just standing there, almost as if hes waiting for me to say goodbye to the girl and the child. I look at him and he hands me a cigarette and says “When you inhale this, you will go back to your world in your time.” The little girl grabbed it from him and threw it away. She wanted me to stay with them, the little girl was about to begin crying when the girl who was holding my hand said “it will be fine, he will be back. I know he will be back.” The man at the door said it was time to go, so he gave me his cigarette and I inhaled.

When I opened my eyes I was outside the abandoned house. I had once again traveled through time. It was a wasteland but the house wasnt there. Nothing was there, only the man and his black vehicle. I got sad right away, and finally was able to say something. “You are going to tell me everything, where am I? Why am I here?” I yelled. The man pushes his glasses up and says “I guess you need to know the truth.” I raise my head toward the sky and focus on it. The sky is blue, the clouds moving overhead. I wake up.


If you have gotten this far, thank you but I am almost finished. I woke up in my bed and was overcome with sadness. I made a promise to that little girl and I couldn't keep it, or at least I thought I couldnt. I needed to see them again, I wanted to feel that feeling again. I didnt get out of bed at all, I stared at the ceiling for about 10 minutes. I wanted to see those girls again, so I immediately went back to bed hoping I would get a chance to see them. I do.

I am back in my dream and I am in the second floor of the abandoned house, I look outside and its nice out, grass is green and the trees look healthy, I could hear birds chirping. I turn around and see the girls, I ran towards the little girl and she ran towards me, jumped towards me and hugged me. I broke down in tears and got on my knees, I was so sorry for leaving them. The girl walked towards me and put her hand on my shoulder and told me it was all going to be okay. I was finally back with them and I was just overcome with happiness. I told them I would never leave them again and they both just smiled at me as I smiled at them. I wake up.

Now when I wake up, I was sad. Real sad. I immediately got depressed. I missed those girls. I miss the girl holding my hand and that feeling it gave me. I miss the little girl who ran up to me and hugged me. For some reason I felt as if I've known these 2 girls for years. Waking up, it was almost as if they were taken from me. I lost something when I woke up, but I had to get out of bed I couldnt go back to sleep. I havnt eaten since I woke up and tried to force myself to eat something, had a couple of bites but not a full meal. I am currently typing this whilst trying not to shed a tear. I have these feelings towards that girl and that child that are tearing me up inside. 

I apologize for this being so long, but I tried to keep it as minimal as I could with just some key points I wanted to hit. I don't expect a response but I just want to know what the hell all that was about. Now tonight, I am going to try my hardest to get back to that same dream, maybe I will be able to speak to these girls or something, but the fact if the matter is, it bothers me. It bothered me so much that I felt I needed to post something on the internet. Thank you for taking some time to read this, and again, im sorry for making this long.

DREAM:
I just woke up and got the strong urge to find meaning in a dream I had last night. I don't remember alot from the dream but I do remember getting out of my bed and walking around to the end of it, and noticing on the floor a crown of white flowers. The scene repeated and next at the end of my bed was a bouquet of white flowers, I think white sweet pea flowers? It would make sense since they're my favourite. And finally the third time it happened there a crown mostly on vine with a couple bright red flowers on it; kind of looked like a lasso now that I think of it.

Any ideas? I'm usually pretty good at understanding what my subconscious is trying to tell me but I'm stumped for symbolism on this one..

I had dreamt that I had gone to the hospital again (I went to the ER a few days ago for stomach pains). The female doctor, a redhead with a concerned look on her face, asked, ""Is it for your stomach again or is it your heart?"" A male doctor stood beside her, eyeing me with concern. He was clean cut and in his mid-thirties or so.

I told her I was back for my stomach issues. Just then, I realized I had some ""sleep"" (eye boogers, for lack of a better term) in my eye, so I wiped it away. With this came a long, slimy, mucus-like string. I continued to pull this mucus string out of my eye and it was followed by all of my optic nerves---a tentacle-like jelly substance. Even still, I kept pulling and once I had removed it all, vomit came shooting out of my tear duct. I was projectile vomiting from my eye. I then began to vomit from my mouth.

The female doctor had medications stuffed into the toilet for some reason, which I realized when the male doctor opened it up (he directed me to vomit there but then decided against it when he saw the medicine stored there). He then nonchalantly sat back and watched me as the redheaded doctor ran out of the room. 

I was rolling around in vomit on the floor, helpless, in a white hospital gown, and that's when I woke myself up crying.

I dreamed I was riding my motorcycle through the mountains. 

(I had done this in real life a week ago, at my grandmother's place which i visited for 2 weeks. I was warned to be careful that there are wolfs in the forests, and I went alone. The day before the dream, I watched some of the videos of me riding through the mountains etc, this is the base of it - back to the dream)

I was passing some hitchhikers with which i had a dispute, because they wouldn't get out of the way. I stopped at a fork in the road with a big forest ahead of me. And a pack of wolfs directly in front of me, between the two roads ahead but in the forest, not on the road itself. The hitchhikers caught up to me and turned right and went up through a path not to go by the wolfes. As they left, the wolf in the front that was smaller and (a female?) came up to me and bit the handlebars on my motorcycle. I was very surprised, (since I""m used to having dogs come up to me barking all the time when i ride the motorcycle through ""wilder"" areas). I 'shoo'ed her off, but remained very surprised at her behavior. As if she threatened me. And she returned next to her pack all of them with a fixed stare at me. I disregarded everything, did not believe for a moment they would mean harm, and thought they would just leave me alone when i start moving and making noise or just run by me, worst case. So i started the motorcycle and raced up the left road. As I passed by them they started running along side me, I did not see them I just 'know' that's what they did. And then suddenly, i was bitten by each arm (the part between the shoulder and the elbow) by massive jaws, and then another bite by the stomach, from behind left side. They all held on firmly to me. I simply stopped the motorcycle, willingly, and did not look at the wolfs. I started screaming for the hitchhikers to help. As i was screaming, the pack started howling, and i think i may have started howling as well. And I woke up, those areas that where bitten feeling weird.

Some extra context: is that I'm going through some rough times in my relationship and it's closely related to what happened while I was at my grandmothers place.

I've been trying to figure this dream out for the past 9 years without much success. I was 18 when it happened. I'm a male, and I was living at my parents, if it's any consolation. And this is long, but I wanted to include the details.

The dream started off in a lush and lively forest. I was looking around at my surroundings, when I noticed a bright orange glow emitting from further down the hill I was standing on. I walked down, and there she was. Sitting on a stump was the most beautiful Fairy I've ever seen (only one I've ever seen). Upon my approach, I managed to startle her and she quickly turned around to acknowledge me. 

She continued to emit that orange aura, her wings were bright and also translucent. Her facial features were that of a human (typical looking Fairy). She was also very attractive and I felt intimidated. She ushered me to come over to her and introduce myself. Her name was Sophia. We had a small chat, nothing I can remember unfortunately. However our time together was closing and she wanted to give me something before I left. She gave me a glass slipper. Yes, same as Cinderella. And then I looked up and she was gone, and the dream ended

I recently had a dream of me that revolved around me running on the back roads of the countryside. I recall I was lost and was trying to find home or a place I could find familiarity. I was depicted as running as fast as cars and there was still ongoing traffic. I recall at one point in the dream, a car got into a wreck with another car who suddenly stopped in front of it. I acknowledged the wreck but I instantly  jumped on the trunk of the car and kept on running ahead. 

During the dream, after running on the road for some time, I would deviate and jump some barbed wire fences (the type you see on country back roads). I don't recall getting hurt from these fences but I do recall being afraid to jump it because of getting hurt. After jumping the fences I would go back on the road for some time and I would realize I went too long and nothing seemed to look familiar so I took another route or retraced myself and took the other path.

Eventually I jumped another fence and this time, there was a lion in the corner. He was sleeping. I recall making the decision whether to sneak by the lion and take the side of the fence that was shorter and the type of fence I was used to, barbed wire and in this case, less hurtful/dangerous, or I could jump the higher more modern fence (electric) further away from the lion. Ultimately I decided to jump the higher electric fence opposed to the lower barbed fence. I wanted to jump this fence because I saw more ""civilization"" from the roadside.

After I jumped this particular fence, everyone was like me; rather than me running with the cars, there were other people running like me on the back roads. They were ALL going in one direction. I recall seeing someone I have met in the past in the dream, let's call her Annie, and I followed her and everyone else. I then turned around and went the opposite direction everyone else was going.

I was getting out of an elevator in some kind of basement settings and I had a firetruck toy in my hand. As I got out, I lost the firetruck and I don't know why. Next thing I know, I was sitting across the counter with an older lady in front of me. It felt like we were arranging my tour, but I don't know what the tour was.

Afterward, the older lady said to me congratulations on my marriage with Sharon. I responded, Sharon? You mean Sarah? Shara? She said no, Sharon.

I was like, wait a minute no, I am not married to anyone. I'm single. Who is Sharon? Where? How?
&nbsp;

She said I met her in Colorado. Sharon was having an issue with her boyfriend, she moved in with me and then from there, we got married.
&nbsp;

While she was telling me all this information, there was a younger lady to the right, looking at the older lady to be extremely cautious with what she is telling me.
&nbsp;

I wasn't sure I understand the whole thing and I told her why would I be in Colorado? She said for a job in medical field. I told her, wait a minute, no, I am single and I have no degree. [Fact]

The dreams haven't all been the same... for instance, the dream last night mostly revolved around an emotional affair that ended in me wanting to tell my boyfriend about it in the hopes that he would forgive me and we could repair our relationship after my dalliance, but the night before it was a very sexually charged dream where I seemed to feel no guilt at the cheating. They all end up with me waking with a very deep pit in my stomach at my actions, followed by intense relief that he's sleeping next to me and it's all a dream.

Some background: we've been seeing each other for a little more than 6 months. Very supportive, very loving relationship. We're both in our late twenties and we're very serious about each other. I could see myself going all the way with this guy. Sex is regular, but has slowed a bit since we first started dating.

Any thoughts? Mostly just wondering why this lady in a happy relationship when she's awake might be sleeping around when she's asleep!

They're intentions where clearly not good! I killed them both. One got away.

I remember coming home to my family feeling some shame. Feeling that I shouldn't have killed them even though it was self defence. I was on my phone, googling ""murder self defence"" but couldn't find anything that supported my actions. So i couldn't call the cops because they would lock me up and i couldn't tell my family because they wouldn't understand. So i was terrified that the man who survived would come back and avenge his friends.

The other thing I remember is that I'm out driving again and the third guy is following me, suddenly I'm sprinting on the side of the road taking giant leaps covering some huge distance without getting tired.

There's things unorganized and the floor is littered with trash. This couldn't be my room cause I am known to be very clean. I also start to hear my brother talking in the living room for he is visiting our family but he never goes into my room  to say hello which is odd since we have a strong bond and never fight.

I still am not unware that I'm dreaming until I open my closet and my youngest brother opens my bedroom door in the exact same time.

Nothing in this dream is outside of my normal experiences/history. 

I actually don't know anyone in the dream, but in it I do. 

I never had issues with drugs and I no longer do drugs nor do I struggle with being sober.

I had this dream last night, here we go:

It's night, in some new city. I'm riding my bicycle and stop by my sketchy friend's house. He and his new girlfriend (of sorts) are there (she doesn't live there and I don't know her). He tells me the cops are coming to arrest him; they have a warrant. He's prepared to go as he knows he FU and he plans on being in prison for a long time.

He wants me to take 3 large bags of coke. He says I can do whatever I want with it, to just get it out of here before they come for him. He then gives the key to the house to his girlfriend as she plans to take the place over.

So, I take the bags across the street to where my bicycle is and prepare to leave. But before that happens, the cops come. So I hang out to see what happens. I go back across the street with the bags still in hand. I don't care if the cops see them, and they don't care about me.

As the cops leave the house with my friend, I go back into the house. The girlfriend doesn't seem to care much about what happened, and has been chill the whole time.

I ask her about the coke, and she says she knew nothing about it. I then open one of the bags to see what we have here. I did a snort. It was very weak. The girlfriend is not surprised about that, as she explains how he likely cut it big time with who knows what. Regardless, she wants some, so we engage together. I then start thinking I could likely fuck her and I know my sketchy friend won't care, but I still have things to do, and the coke sucks. Then some other people show up, and it's now a small party. But as I'm not feeling 'it' and I have places to go, I leave the bags with her and leave.

On my way, I pass a cop car in the bike lane. They have a search light out, scanning a nearby field. I simply pass them and continue on my way.

I then take a shortcut through a parking lot and accidentally scrape a nice white BMW with my bicycle. This guy was just getting into it, so I stop and say I'm sorry. He says it doesn't matter, and is not concerned. So, I move on..

I then make it to where I was going; a mini market for some food. But I'm no longer hungry because of the coke? I don't feel high, hmm, but whatever. So I then go home.

When I get home, I can't see what my place looks like and most everything is in boxes. I see no one else there, but I guess I have a house mate, IDK. I then go to sleep.

In the morning, I ride to the bicycle shop to get something minor done on my bicycle. As I'm waiting for help, this guy with a gas powered bicycle comes in and asks this person behind me for help. That guy says, sure, let me check it out. He then takes the bicycle outside, starts the engine and rides away. That other guy is still standing there, now looking worried. He then tells the people who work there what happened, and they confirm he just got ripped off.

I then see my friend's girlfriend walking by. So before getting help, I leave the bicycle shop to go see her. But before I catch up to her I woke up.

I have an abusive ex. It all reached a boiling point when he attacked me three months ago and I got a restraining order filed on him. He has some felony charges he's dealing with at the moment. He strangled me, swung kitchen knives and a katana at me, and injured my wrist. I spent about month healing physically, and I've been in ptsd therapy since then. 

Onto the dream, which I had over the weekend after the assaults. We were napping together on my bed. I was holding him. We woke up, realizing we needed to run to a department store to find a coffee table. We got dressed and headed there. 

It wasn't until we were actually in the store that it happened. The more we looked for the coffee table, the stranger he acted. For reference, he's a very tall man in his twenties. I was so absorbed in shopping, I didn't realize he left me. I turned and just saw that he vanished. I was so panicked. I tore through the aisles searching for him and calling his name out. 

Finally, I saw a small boy appear from an aisle. It was him as an 8 year old. It was still his blonde hair, he still had the same birthmark above his right eye. His blue eyes were tearful, wide and afraid. Each step I took toward him, he took a step back and sobbed. He was looking for his mother.

He let his guard down and I reached out to hug him while he sobbed. 

He has a history of childhood abuse, from what he told me. He told me on our first date that his step-father banged his head down into their old coffee table, giving him a sizable injury to his frontal lobe that his hair hides pretty well. His mother died when he was 8, thrusting him into the foster care system until he was adopted at age 14. 

It's the craziest dream I've had that's involved him. I know there's deep symbolism in it that I can't figure out. I had a dream he would attack me the week before the assaults, but that's pretty self-explanatory. 

During the assaults, he seemed very fearful despite him being the aggressor. I spent the whole night crying and trying to keep him calm. He was shifting between sadness, rage and unconsciousness that whole night.

I'm a 20 y/o female who's admittedly had some pretty whacky dreams but this recent one I can't seem to shake... I feel like I /have/ to know what it means. 

It all started in my house with my mom, from what I remember there were two men (I think they were my uncles but I'm not positive) my baby brother (who is usually the centre of my attention) wasn't there. (the reason that could be important is because Jared pretended to be a lion 24/7 — even roaring in church — for the first 4 years of his life)
also possibly important is my poppa is a Leo and I've been scavenging the Internet for various lion tattoo designs...

anywho to the dream...

I saw a mouse run across my living room floor and screamed, the thing was normal looking, ran fast and hid under the baseboard of the wall. 
I told the two men this and it was decided they must be living in the walls of my house.
We naturally wanted to rid ourselves of the vermin so the next thing you know we're ripping off the drywall to check if our theory was correct. 

Low and behold there wasn't a mouse to be seen, rather something much different was hidden in the wall... 
There were at least four adult lion corpses (one male three female). 
They were my landlord/next door neighbours lions (not really, the wildest things he has are peacocks) and to make things even weirder we were all so nonchalant about it
. 
""Ohhh that's were the lions went!"" was my moms reaction. We were all totally fine with them being there, like it was totally normal to have a dead lion pride decomposing in ones wall, without odour or reasonable space for them to even fit...

is this just some twisted weird dream that I can dismiss like the one I had about a human hunting Reese's Peanut Butter Cup or is there something deeper there?

I was in a room that closely resembled one of the classrooms from when I was in third grade only smaller and more cluttered. Despite this I recognized it as my current job and the people in there as my co-workers.
There were only a few desks and a shelf filled with cardboard boxes, I don't know what was in them. 
We were going through a combination of what I do at work and learning something that I don't remember when my boss, who was at the teacher's desk, showed us her pet birds. 
They weren't in a cage, she just pulled them out of thin air and let them fly around.
One went right to the shelf with the boxes and started going in and out of them and I didn't pay much attention to it. It was a just a normal looking parakeet.
The second one was about twice as big and had a three pronged beak, sort of like a squid only with three parts instead of two and more pointy.
After a while of hovering in front of me like a hummingbird it took off out the window that had apparently been open the whole time.

0.0,5wqly2,1.0,3.0,"A few weeks ago, I dreamed that I cut my dog's face off because she needed to grow a new one. Like, in the dream, it was just this normal thing. No biggie. Every dog needs its face cut off once in a while so it can grow a new one. Think of a lizard tail and how if it gets pulled off, the lizard grows a new one. Except that apparently all dogs NEEDED this to happen in the dream.

So, I cut her face off - but it was earlier then needed. Thus, the face still had sentience and could communicate. I felt bad, so instead of disposing of it (there was a literal service that specialized in properly and ethically disposing of your dog's used face, btw), I kept it around. I apologized to the face, saying that I had made a mistake. It told me it was fine, I just needed to wait longer the next time. You know, so the fucking face was ripe enough to cut off. 

At night, I kept it in the refrigerator so it didn't start stinking and rotting. In the day time, I kept it with me on a plate so it could talk to me. All the while, my dog's body is walking around, alive and well, with no face. Her head stopped just past the ears. I ended up waking up before I had to dispose of the face.   

I have lots of dreams with my dog in them that have perfect explanations to them. This one doesn't. For the record, I would NEVER harm my doggo ever. That's why when I woke up, I was incredibly disturbed because you don't cut off your fucking pet's face so it can grow another new face. It was weird. 

Any ideas?",top,I cut my dog's face off so she could grow a new one?!?!?,3.0
0.0,5rf06p,0.0,3.0,"So I'm usually very scientific about anything, but this creeps me out... Yesterday I had a dream where said friend was staying at my home and was supposed to leave soon. Irl he lives about 120 miles away and I only met him 2 times irl, we don't do that often because we're both 16 and his parents are very strict.
Anyway, in that dream I wanted to show him something rather irrelevant and at about 9:30 PM *he noticed that he missed the last train* for today (the house we met in was in a small village; I'm not at all aware about the travel plans of trains btw), so he decided to stay at my place for the night ignoring how his parents would punish him. The rest of the dream was pretty fucked up and not so important for the context, but it went somewhat nightmare-ish, at that point he wasn't really involved anymore.

Later that day irl, we got into a pretty unimportant political argument. He's very unpredictable, but before that happened he was relatively calm and there were no signs of what would happen. That argument escalated though, and since he can't really take defeats he simply said that it's over now and that he has enough. He then proceeded to block me on any social media where we're connected. That happened around 9:30 PM, the same time he ""missed the last train"" in that dream before.

So this morning I had a dream where I couldn't sleep in and thus went outside, it was a completely fictional area. An also completely fictional DC who slightly looked like that friend approached me and said that I should *tell his friend to go to the train station* if I happen to see him. IIRC I knew that his friend was that one who left me irl, even though I didn't know that DC.

So yeah, I guess I'm just paranoid, but these signs look very weird to me. He was my second best friend and already blocked me in the past once for 2 months, but that was just a few weeks after we got to know eachother. I only noticed the coincidences from the first paragraph this morning btw, so I don't think I was consciously influenced by that last night.

I had a dream that I went upstairs in my childhood home. There was a little girl sitting on the floor at the top of the steps. She looked up at me. I was scared of her. She wasn't threatening or ugly but I felt like she was a ghost. I walked into a door to the right of her and there was a very negative and scary presence. I felt like there was a male demon in the room but I never saw him. There was a yellow framed parchment that red and yellow ink was being used to write things this person was trying to tell me. I could not read the writing but it kept coming. I went thru this loop of walking up the stairs, the little girl, then the negative room with the writing several times. Always the same. After being very afraid, I went downstairs and found my parents. I was going to tell them what was happening but it never came out. I got upset. Went upstairs hit the little girl in the head with something knocking her back. I went into the room and it was empty. The scroll was gone. The negative presence was there but no action. I was upset that the presence was gone because I wanted to confront/fight it. 

The dream moved and I was on a plane with an old female employee of mine. She was oversees and we were sitting next to each other. There was a creepy fat man hovering over the seats watching us. It was like she was trying to tell me something but couldn't because of him. I knew I had to help her but we couldn't talk because of him. I just woke up after that.

So he had this dream last night where he went into a haunted house with 2 other people, whose faces he couldn't remember. It was a house people died in, as they were searching they split off and suddenly he was alone. He walked into a huge kitchen, he thinks it was used to cater to large numbers of people, since this haunted house was a mansion. He came into an open walk pantry and as he walked towards it, a door closed behind him and the pantry just became a room with just walls. And then this entity showed. up and said, ""You're mine now."" Then  he woke up.
The figure was clothed in a black robe that cut off at its knees and elbows, the skin was glossy white and it has black-hole eyes, large hands, and razor sharp nails. He said the voice sounded like a woman.
This dream is very similar to one he had before. He had a similar dream every night for two years until his grandfather's death. however, in this one the entity had black skin and red eyes.
There was a Hallway of Memories, good memories on the left, and bad on the right. The hallway seemed never-ending but when he hit the end, a bright light would blind him and this creature, with the black skin and red eyes instead, would appear and grab him.

He also said that this hallway was the gateway to his dreams, and the way he was able to lucid dream. He used to only dream about memories, from the doors in there, until this entity appeared and it scared him, so he stopped lucid dreaming.

Sorry for the long wall of text, but this is all the information I have for the dream. And I'd really like to know if anyone would help interpret it. It seems to have a lot of symbolism related to duality. The black vs the white creature, doors to good and bad memories, and it seems to also be related to the life vs death, balance vs calamity concept. And how the dreams stopped when his grandfather died. Any ideas would be appreciated, thank you !

Edit: What we are most wondering is, what is this entity ? And what does it represent in this dream ? as in, what is its purpose ?

0.0,4inysd,0.0,3.0,"I haven't had these dreams in years, but they were either separate or all grouped together into one dream, but all of them were recurring, and would happen years after I had last had them, so I'm not sure if I'll have them again someday or not. I last had the dreams all grouped together about 10 years ago. I am now going on 21 years old, so I was around 11 at the time. The time I remember before that was probably when I was around 4 or so, and it happened a lot around that time, but I had forgotten all about it until it recurred.

These dreams were always in fuzzy black and white, like an old TV that had poor signal. The sound was very muffled as well, but everything I felt in this dream I actually felt physically, which had never happened to me in any other dream. I would always jolt awake from these dreams startled, and feel as if I had awoken from an extremely deep sleep, yet was only half asleep at the same time.

The first dream of the sequence (or sometimes the only dream) was that I was in a tunnel under a bunch of highway bridges (kind of like the double decker ones that swirl around) and there was an old VW Beetle (and although the dream was always in black and white I somehow knew the car was yellow) that would turn from the right side of the tunnel (the road had a bend in it right before the tunnel entrance) and then head straight toward me. It would run me over and I would feel what felt like a pillow being thrown at me. I would fall straight back like a bowling pin. It would repeat itself like an animated GIF and I would sometimes try waving at it or holding up my hand to say ""stop"". I could never move other than that for some reason. The car would hit me two or three times, and occasionally a faint voice would say ""watch out, he's coming"".

One of the dreams I remember following this one was that a young boy was showing me his cat who had just given birth to kittens. The kittens were nursing and I reached over to pet one. The boy then said ""watch out, she doesn't like that"" and then the mother cat jumped up and attacked my face, which also felt like a pillow being thrown at me.

Usually it was only two dreams, but I also remember another one I would occasionally have in which there was no picture, just complete darkness. However, I felt as if I was jumping on a trampoline, and somehow, even with just the darkness, I could see myself jumping on the trampoline subconsciously. Then I would wake up and feel sad that it was over.

A fairly recent one that reminds me of the last dream especially that I have been having lately is very short, but always jolts me awake. It is also complete darkness, but for some reason I feel that I am running or walking fast to get something done. Then one of my legs slips very violently out from underneath me (usually my left one slips very sharply to the right) and I can almost feel the strain in the bones and muscle as I jolt awake and realize it was just a dream. This one also scares me because I have a history of hip problems and have a fear of falling and making it worse.

I used to have the fuzzy black and white dreams a lot, and I had a few other similar ones, but I haven't had them in years.

I have heard that the slipping dream is actually because my heart rate and breathing slowed too fast due to falling asleep too quickly and that my brain created the dream to jump start my heart.

Does anyone know if any of these dreams have any particular meaning, or has anyone had similar dreams? I have always felt like I'm the only one who's had these and I've always been deeply curious about them. Thank you in advance!",top,Please interpret my recurring childhood dreams!,3.0

I never posted anything on reddit before. So if I’m doing anything wrong, let me know. And sorry if this post doesn’t have any structure. I'm writing everything down asap because I don’t want to forget details which may be of importance.

 
First let me give you guys a little background about me.

 
I’m an U.S. American living in Germany. As a matter of fact I was born and raised over here in Germany by American parents. (please pardon any grammar and spelling mistakes, even though English is my first language, everyone who grew up bilingual knows how it is ^^) I am currently 19 years old and I’m studying computer science at a nearby university. I’m planning on moving to the states as soon as I’m done with university. I practice lucid dreaming for almost 2 years now and I achieved some magnificent results. I have a lucid dream like every other day. But nothing was like this today. I have no fucking idea what it means.  I even woke up because of the dream, which never happened before. As soon as I woke up I immediately texted my best friend and told her about my dream. She also had no idea and that’s why I’m posting on reddit now. I know this dream has to mean something.
 

I am currently studying for my finals and it’s not cute. I guess some of you can relate. I study almost every single minute I’m awake. I also got in a huge fight with my boyfriend before I went to sleep (He’s currently at our apartment but I’m at my mom’s until tomorrow, I spent the entire holiday season at my mom’s.

 
The funny thing is, even though I often dream lucidly, nothing was like this ever before. I can remember literally EVERYTHING. This quite scares me because I guess you guys are familiar with the concept of lucid dreaming but I never thought it would be this intense.

 
Okay now let’s get to the dream.

 
I was at an airport with a ticket to Kairos, Italy (which doesn’t exist as a town or something similar btw. But it’s an investment bank based in Milano, Italy. The address according to google is: Via S. Prospero, 2, Milano, Italy, and it’s also a theater in New York ) for 10 days and I was travelling all by my self. It was probably spring or summer since the sun was shining. Everything was normal, I checked in, waited like forever and finally got on the plane. We took off with no complications. After 2 hrs. I heard the captain announce that something was not right and we had to make an emergency landing at a nearby airport. (I don’t know at which Airport I was but a flight from Germany to Italy takes like max. 2 ½ hours)  I was not worried at all. (I fly frequently so I’m used to flying and I’m not scared of flying at all). Here's where it gets weird. We landed on a street. A plain fucking street with cars driving around and stuff. There was no announcement that the runway was blocked whatsoever. So we landed on the street which led to the airport and the pilot asked us to leave the plane so the crew could check everything and we’ll be soon taking off again.
 

So a crew member escorted us to a designated lobby for this particular airline (the plane was an airbus with a name in red on it and had red accents but I can’t tell which airline it was). The lobby was something like a first class lobby with a view on the runway.  As soon as we arrived at the lobby I got me 2 croissants at a bakery inside the airport and ate them right away. When Afterwards I wanted to smoke a cigarette but I noticed I had none so I was looking for place to get cigarettes. We have cigarette vending machines over here in Germany so I was looking for one but I couldn’t find one. (Usually airports don’t even have these kind of vending machines) So I asked this nice African American man and he showed me the nearest one. Okay so I got my cigs, smoked and got back to the lobby. For some reason I had a hotel room inside the lobby so I went in my ""hotel room"" and sat on the bed thinking “Gosh, this trip is going to be awful, I’m going to buy a whole bunch of books and read them during my time in Italy. I will crawl into my bed and just read the entire day” and then it was like time was passing so fucking fast and after a whilebI was wondering if they made an announcement that they’re ready to go. So I opened my door and I saw the plane I was supposed to be on taking off... without me. I was thinking “Fuck, why the fuck are they leaving without me? Did they even make an announcement?” For some reason I wanted to go to Italy and it felt like inevitable to me. So it was important for me to go to Italy even though I already knew it would be boring. The plane was taking off and just a couple of seconds later the plane began to tumble and roll over and then it exploded. I saw the airplane exploding right before me. I was standing in the lobby watching the airplane crashing. Then I heard a cellphone ringing and I was immediately like “Someone of the passengers must have left his or her phone by accident.” So I ran to the phone and answered it. An old man was on the other side and told he wants to speak to his wife, she’s on her way to Italy. And I told him angrily “Don’t you follow the news? She’s most likely dead!” While I was talking to him the TV Screen in the lobby showed what happened with the headline “Plane crashes, no survivors” and then I woke up.
 

My heart was pounding and I couldn’t move for the next 10 minutes. The whole dream was recapping over and over before my open eyes. I don’t think it was sleep paralysis because I had sleep paralysis once before and it was nothing like it. It was like I choose to recap everything. And it was like little flashbacks, every scene in no particular order. After these 10 minutes I immediately texted my best friend (she lives like 60ish km away from my mom’s place) and luckily she was awake. While I was waiting for her to respond I googled on my iPad what dreams about plane crashes are supposed to mean but nothing makes sense!


I really hope some of you can help me. I know this dream has to mean something! I never had a lucid dream like this ever before. Maybe I’m missing some key details so feel free to ask me anything and I’ll try my best to answer immediately.  


Thanks in advance.

However, last night I had a dream that shook me awake. I awoke to tears welling up in my eyes and I was truly shaken. I'm in a strange, almost forlorn mood today, to the point that I've cancelled my plans to go see the new star wars movie with my group (9 people).


In my dream, I am inside a house or some type of community center type building - just outside is an amphitheater with a large group of people sitting in it - the amphitheater overlooks the house, it is not practical.


I am doing some vague task that I can't recall in the dream when I hear a loud scream come from the amphitheater. I run out to find a dog in the audience (a black lab, by the looks) dead. I climb the stands and ask a grieving woman what happened - she points to a baby eagle, peacefully perched on one of the seats.
This next part is what upsets me the most. The crowd begins to draw weapons - guns, swords, insane things. Their aim is to kill this tiny eagle, this little baby bird. I speak up and tell them all to stand down as I pick up the little bird. In the dream, my lip is quivering and I am close to tears. I apologize to the bird, who is only as big as the palm of my hand. He is puffed up and filled with air. I push a knife through his little chest and I can feel the air escape from his body until he finally dies in my hand.


At this very moment, I am crying just thinking about this moment in my dream. Why did I do that? Why did the air escaping from this tiny creature feel so real to me? If anyone has any ideas as to what this could possibly mean, please tell me.",top,Death of an eagle?,3.0
0.0,3x37sp,7.0,3.0,"Here is a little about myself. I am a 23 year old male that graduated from an extremely small college 6 months ago. 3 months ago I moved to Cincinnati and started Mortuary School and we just finished our first semester. I work for a funeral home here in Cincinnati.

In my dream, my friend’s house, old high school, college fraternity, and funeral home I work for currently were all located in the Cambridge City/Dublin area on National Road 40.

I started out at a local cemetery where I used to dig graves and footers in. I then realized I was supposed to be at work for the funeral home I am currently at, so I set off jogging. I was carrying a mattress with me so it was slow going. 

The first stop along my way was at a friend’s house. He saw me and pulled me aside. I sat the mattress down and leaned it against a truck. We chatted about knives and fishing for a while and then I heard my current work places phone ring and stop. At that point I knew I had to leave because I was supposed to be answering the phone. I picked the mattress up and continued on my way. Before I left the driveway a man stopped me and asked if that mattress was new. I said yes and he continued by saying don’t leave that anywhere be sure to take it with you.

 Still carrying my mattress I jogged by my high school but didn’t go in. It was dark with no one there. I just jogged by and stared at it.

As I was jogging with my mattress I passed by a girl I went to high school with but never spoke to. I never had any connection with her other than passing her in the hall way. I believe her name was Kelly Green. She was also running but it appeared she was going the opposite way and had stopped for a break. As I passed she just looked at me and seemed really sad to be where she was. 

I continued jogging and went through an intersection where there was some construction. As I jogged by one of the workers yelled at me. It was another one of my high school friends who had joined the Army right out of high school. We didn’t talk, I just jogged by and looked. As I was jogging away, another kid I was in boy scouts with yelled “Go back to Arizona!” and I could hear him talking about the trip I took with my fraternity a couple of summers ago. He was telling the friend in the army about how much I loved Arizona and wanted to go back.
 
I then saw a funeral procession and I knew it was being led by my current bosses, so I ducked into an ally and waited for it to pass. As it passed I could see sad people in their cars with orange procession flags on top. The phone rang again in my dream and I knew I had to keep going. After it passed I kept jogging, still carrying my mattress. 
Somehow I ended up jogging to my old fraternity. I went inside the building and up to my old room. I didn’t go in my room, although I wanted. I could hear people talking and playing FIFA. I heard my name but they weren’t talking about me. They were talking to a kid with my same name who was a freshman when I was a senior. 

 I ended up walking down the hall going past all of the other rooms. At this point I didn’t have my mattress. A friend of mine, who was a grade below me in college, stopped me and asked what I was doing there. He was really excited, but I told him to calm down because I didn’t want people to know I was there. I then left the fraternity.
 For some reason as I left, I ran out the front door with two fraternity sweatshirts. Another one of my friends was lying on the porch and he had the flu or something. As I ran by he yelled “where did you get those shirts!?” I said “don’t worry about it” He then said “be sure to wash those shirts, you don’t want to catch the plague.” I then left and continued on my journey with my mattress and two sweatshirts. 

The fraternity ended up being further down the road than where I needed to be. So I started back but it took me down a very foggy, winding, cliffside road with a guardrail. This road was just like the one leading to my college. As I reached the entrance of the college the actual real life phone rang and woke me up.

 I answered but it clicked twice and nobody was there. I got a weird sad feeling and couldn’t go back to sleep after that. I really wish I could have finished the dream.

0.0,3e8djn,0.0,3.0,"My dreams feature a local of recurring settings, and this one began no differently. However, it quickly became more violent, more desperate, and I awoke with a sense that I had already resigned myself to defeat. The symbolic interactions might have meaning, but they are complex as there was an inherent narrative that I felt was being played out.  


>A darkly lit highrise, inside is a clean, modernist suite that houses some kind of firm. Men and women in business dress. One of them I feel I am seeking. I do not belong, and every well-dressed professional in the building at midnight glances at me as I pass. I finally speak with someone, in a small room with windows for walls, watching police officers patrol outside. I don't like what I hear, so I leave the way I came. I'm outside now, the streets are dark, the tall building itself is what I am now concerned about. Somehow I manage to enter through a window at the top, attempting to access some kind of vault hidden in the floors above the suite downstairs. It's locked, and I am caught, but I manage to namedrop or something and the guard leaves. I finally make it inside the vault, there's somebody I speak with.  


This, so far, was vaguely reminiscent of dreams I've had before.  


>The violence erupts as I, in a paranoid display, gun down two women and a man as they are working inside a room in the suite. They are standing behind a counter, one like you would see at a bank, and I felt regret immediately. I fled the suite out of the open window. I've never killed anyone in a dream before, much less innocent, unrelated people. If there was a clear narrative and reason, I can't remember it now, but the catharsis of the violence felt as if I had burned all my bridges, there was nothing to go back to, and now I had to avoid capture. Police were present before, but I began to see more of them as I made as casual an escape as I could. Nobody seemed to know what I had done, yet I walked out the front door again, sweating from the tension. This is where I remembered flight.   

Flight in my dreams has always been present, since I was much younger. It began as being able to leap very high and somehow tense my legs to float down, and if I focused I could remain suspended in air. Now, I believe that because I've spent more time in the waking world thinking about it, my ability to fly in dreams has been hindered. Now, I must struggle to lift myself a foot off the group, throwing my focus down along my spine and legs, much like a rocket propulsion system. 

>I spent what felt like the entire night now watching over my shoulder, trying to convince people to hide me, displaying my ability to ~~fly~~ suspend myself above the ground. The dream now was centered on the moment where I slew those three people. Someone at one point mentioned the murder to me, citing the police had no idea who would do this, and that wore off some of the paranoia that had been before.  

I can't not recall much more, the violence what occurred early on was the fulcrum to the entire dream after it, and I felt suspended on the longer end, praying the weight opposite me remained.   

I feel as if I understand a lot about my psyche via my dream[s]*, but the symbolism of a triple-murder and its juxtaposition to my diminished ability for flight is beyond me. I'd love to hear this community's take on what these moments could indicate to me.",top,Gunfire and Levitation,3.0

I think the last dream that had any impact on me was this one dream where I was standing in a room but I couldn't see my body. The room was just a box or like a cube I was inside of. The room was like a negative photo the walls were black and the lines were white. The room started to vibrate and distorted the lines and all the sudden there was a white dot in the center of the wall in front of me. The room started to vibrate more intensely and the dot got bigger and bigger and two lines shot out the sides of the dot which was a circle now and the vibrations got really intense. It felt like I was transcending something but then the vibrations got really intense and I felt it all coursing through me like it was seeping in to me and becoming a part of me. When the vibrations got too intense for me to handle I woke up and every nerve and fiber of my being was vibrating. I woke up feeling like I would had leaned something but still to this day I can't figure out what I had learned.

0.0,3axzwz,3.0,3.0,"Hello, i would like to have an interpretation of this dream.

I was in a back of an unknown school classroom and there was this feeling that I passed a test but got an answer wrong which forces me to redo the test or the answer (i don't quite remember). And I was so agitated on the inside thinking ""i wish that i hadn't done this question wrong, it could have saved me a lot of troubles"". The teacher looked a lot like Joyce Meyer (the evangelist you see on TV) and in the dream i didn't make a correlation between their looks; it was after i woke up that I did so. Anyway I only spotted Joyce Meyer on TV a couple of times and I'm no evangelist and the teacher gave the impression of a confident, serious woman. 
My answers were all written on the board in front of the whole class, and the answer which was incorrect had a ""3.5"" on top of it. That's the grade of the answer. In my country test are corrected over 20 so a 3.5/20 is really bad. And mind that everytime I crossed this 3.5 i would feel remorseful.

Then I spotted an old crush of mine (who friendzoned me at the time) wearing a black dress sitting at the left of the classroom one desk before the last one. She didn't notice me not one bit and I for a reason only took a glimpse of her. Nothing of that mattered cause she want to the desk behind her and fell asleep next to someone that I knew before. Note: each desk contains two seats and not one.

Anyway then I find the teacher on my right asking me what is my preffered language. I remember in the dream feeling confident about the answer so I said proudly ""English"". But then half the class laughed silencly and the others were kind of dissapointed, and I was wondering why. The teacher looked at  me and said : ""I asked what language you prefer, and by that I mean what accent do you prefer?"" And then to my surprise the two people sitting before me (one was was my buddy in school he plays the electric guitar and is pursuing a career at it and the other is small man (a dwarf if i may say) i knew in school too) jumped out the desk and were really agitated but in a fun way. I remember i had a smile on my face when i saw them getting up.

There were other parts of the dream unrelated to the classroom but I don't remember them.

I am a 22 male, and i have just passed my first masters year ( i have one left) and after finishing my masters i'm planning to go abroad to study musicology and composition. The day I had this dream i was kind of depressed thinking i'm uncreative and if this music thing does really belong to me.

Now, I discover what seems to be two alien artifacts unknown to human kind. I'm the first to discover it. One of which is twice the size of a marble and looks simply clouded inside with just a white color. Nothing abnormal. The other is a type of crystalline rod, but looks very similar to those glass ceiling light rod thingies. You know what I'm talking about. Those long lights. 

Whenever the two get close to each other, the inside of the marble object begins to clear and suddenly, a round golden sci-fi ring is spinning inside it, increasing rapidly as the seconds go by. Think of a Sonic ring, then imagine it being made of different lengths of piping, and add a couple red jewels or rubies in between the connecting pieces. That's the best I can describe what's inside the marble. At this point, after the ring has formed and is spinning faster than the eye can track, the rest of the marble turns into the color of the sky. In my dream, I felt like I was looking through a portal, and the other side of the portal was located somewhere in the sky, above cloud level. I was right in my dream. It was a portal. Suddenly, without warning, meteorites begin striking my house and all around me, almost as though it was a consequence for activating whatever items I had found. After I pulled the objects away from each other, the marble went back to its dirty color and everything stopped. I was very scared and felt like I caused the destruction and possible deaths of those around me. I then woke up.

&#x200B;

I was having dinner and drinks with a group of friends, some familiar and some unfamiliar. It seemed like it was dwindling down so we all started to try and make our seperate ways. One of the unfamiliar people, an attractive dirty blonde woman who seemed slightly older, came up to make and said ""its still early, lets go back to my house and keep drinking"". I agreed and we went off. The home was a mansion, a fairly luxurious one with a lot of wooden fixtured, so i'd call it semi rustic. She hands me a glass filled with alcohol and she leads me upstairs. She gets undressed into her underwear and I sit by her bed on a wooden chair. At no point did it seem erotic, the whole time the feeling was ""friendly"". We chat for a bit and she starts telling me about her marital problems. ""He always seems angry, and I only really see him at night."" I try to tell her usually its okay to have a busy partner. ""Yeah"" she says. ""I think he just wants to step 6."" I ask: ""What's step 6?""

&#x200B;

Almost on cue, I hear a door from downstairs slam open. I run out, and in the foyer stands no other than fucking Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson wearing a tank top, sweaty, and holding what looked like a 50 pound dumbbell over his head. ""I'm sorry (name), BUT YOU HAVE TO GET THE FUCK OUT. I'm about to step 6!""

&#x200B;

As he said this, he steps up the stairs loudly as I rush down the oppsite direction. He moves past me, dumbbell still in hand, and the man is MASSIVE. As i'm about to reach the front door. I hear the moans and growns of The Rock fucking the shit out of his wife. As I leave the house that's when I wake up in a cold sweat. I think it was the Rock yelling at me, but I have no idea.

There we 've got some parents' friends with their four children. This time it seems that I was staying for some time there and the children bedrooms were functioning as a sort of a hostel. I was very anxious to find some clothes and stuff that was mine and I could not remember where I have hidden them. Then a woman which functioned as a hostel service or something tried to help me to find my stuff. In the beginning we had no success but finally she noticed that my stuff were beneath my sheet at my bedroom. This bedroom  in real life belonged to one of the four children. This person is the only one that is married and has a child of his own. After the girl found my stuff , for a very peculiar reason had sex with me.

After some blurry events in between, I find myself at the main highway of this area. i have taken a cab and asked where can I find a place to cut my hair. Τhe cab driver leaves me  on the left side of the road while the haircut place was on the right so I had to walk a bit.

Then when I go into the place, there are two Indian people that are the hairdressers.

Without any introduction, the one of them starts messing with my hair, but I interrupt him asking how much is the cost of the haircut. Then both of them mention some high and ridiculous prices like 50.000 euro, 10.000 euro and the likes. Each time I am asking them to set a proper price they set the price a little bit lower but it still sounds ridiculous.

The one that does my hair finishes and I am going to see them in a mirror.

I don't like the result at all ( I look like a 60's member of Beatles or something!) and I mention to them that this is not what I wanted and explain that I would like my rear hair to be shaved but not in the highest razor scale. The hairdresser agrees but he does not listen to me and uses the highest scale which leads to my frustration! Another guy comes in and settles a haircut for 4 euro but my hairdresser says this is a special price and I have to give him 50 euro. I only have in my purse 8 euro and I insist that this is a ridiculous price as we are not in Hiltons' hotel haircut place or something!

It's been a while since I've had a dream that actually gave me pause, the last time this happened it was a dream of ""religious"" symbolage. The same occurred again. 

No demons, no death, no true terror, just confusion as to what it could mean. I was in a building similar to a mall and a university. It began inside a computer lab where i was working on some essay or report. I began procrastinating and eventually left the lab. I entered a large hallway and spotted two men. They were cleaning up trash. I went over to help them but was interrupted by a cloth or bag falling from an upper story, this caused panic (facetious?) In the bystanders, and anger in the trash men. They scolded me for trying to help them, and told me to go back to my essay. Flustered, annoyed, and confused, I walked back to the lab. On my monitor, I found a note. Several other people in the lab had this note as well. The note contained a plea of relationship from a homosexual, begging for relationships and intercourse. What followed was a clip of him performing sexual acts on another. I immediately closed the note and left. I walked out of the hallway and into the main floor. I eventually went up an escalator and into an open room where I was being flagged down. I find myself going to the room where it has wood panel floors and white walls and a glass facade. Every 5 feet about, the wall extended out 3 feet. Inside some of the alcoves were glass displays, like that for wax figures. Inside one was an old man at a chalkboard, the rest were empty. 

The man who flagged me down was Jesus of Nazareth, appearing in the form of the European renditions. He led me inside where I was met with Jesus, Buddha, old man(in the case), and a frame containing the virgin Mary depicted as a queen, wielding a sword. As we walked in the room, Jesus directed me to the old man saying ""when you are ready this will be your guide"". I then sat on the floor between them all, where Buddha and Jesus talked like old friends, both telling me that they have been watching me and helping me as best they can. Jesus directed me to then gaze into the image of the queen mary. She smiled, and looked downward, her sword planted into the ground, her hands moving almost displaying sign language, bloodied water poured forth in a frothing motion, followed by intense blue flames that reached her neck. She lifted the sword into an upward facing motion, pointing to the sky. She gave a knowing, motherly smile. Buddha and Jesus looked at me and said ""your time will come"". The dream ended, my confusion has only grown. What does this mean, what does any of it mean.

It looks similar to the houses in London, but on a small hill. They had invited me over for dinner and I was going to help them set up. As I turn my head, I see that their front yard had an apple tree at the bottom of the stairs without any fruit. But suddenly, all the apples started to blossom and grow ripe in a matter of seconds. But they did not stop there; all of the apples just kept getting bigger and bigger, but stayed ripe. My cousins got excited and we all ran over to the tree to pick as many apples as we could. 

But I uttered to myself, ""Have I had this dream before? I feel like something will come when these apples grow big out of the blue."" And sure enough, I heard a noise in the sky.

As quickly as they came, they suddenly disappeared into dust and everything was quiet. I went outside to see what had happened to the apple tree, but it was perfectly in tact as if nothing had eaten or bit into the apples, or the tree itself. I looked closer and saw that the apples were now regular large sized apples that you would usually find in the supermarket. They were still ripe and had not looked like they had been eaten at all. Despite what had happened, we still continued to pick the apples and threw it in a basket.

It was in one of those “downstairs” office complex’s. It was empty. To the left of the doctor’s room was a large flatscreen TV. I figured this must be the waiting area. The TV came with a copy of Uncharted. I figured I would just play that while I wait.

The doctor(who was a very attractive asian woman) calls me in. She asked me basic questions first. Afterwards she held a large ceiling mounted light in front of my face. She covered my eyes and asked if I saw anything unusual. The light started flashing at an incredibly rapid rate but since her hand was covering my eyes all I could see were pulses of red.

I saw a full basketball stadium and a smiling blond (or ginger, I can hardly tell the two apart) who’s facial expression morphed into anger. He pulled out a gun and started shooting. I tried to pull myself free but my mind and body felt like it was tranquilized. I tried to keep myself active by asking the rational questions. He couldn’t wait to leave the crowd before shooting me? But it did kind of make sense the more I thought about it. A packed stadium is the perfect place to get attention for a mass shooting which is normally motivated by narcissism after aggrieved male entitlement.

I woke up in that same room but all the lights were off. The lights from the window facing the waiting room still poured in. I tried to turn on the lights. You know how lights sometimes flicker first before turning on? They flickered indefinitely. I walked out of the room to see if anyone was there. The main lobby had the same doctor casually talking to people. I tried to speak but My words were slurred like I was one some kind of anesthetic. One of those people was Jack Thomson wearing a Team America World Police hat. Everyone ignored me, said their goodbyes and left. I tried to get Jack Thompson’s attention so I could shake his hand. I finally compiled my request to shake his hand and he agreed. but then I woke up for real.

Here’s some context. Jack Thompson was the leader against video games on the premise that video games condition people to commit murder. Sort of lines up when you consider I played a game before watching a kid try to shoot me. I was strongly against Jack Thompson at that time but I still gave him the benefit of the doubt since ESA statistics are sourced from the NPD which used bias sampling. That and the ESA is part of the ECA which is a corporate lobbying group. If it’s at all relevant I was also a large Gamergate supporter.  I didn’t want to end feminism or whatever. Just to ensure we use feminism as a tool to create wonderful art but still maintain ideological balance and variety in art through fair and balanced criticism ie. “Ethics in journalism.” Many people in that group were people who were also large adversaries of the games as violence movement in the past. I no longer see either of them as a threat. Gaming as an artform is too large to be confined creatively.

I’m a progressive in real life, but if you look at my post history, I play the roll of a condescending idiot. I just love fucking with egotistical people who think they are smarter than everyone else and think they know everything. Could you imagine being a round earther back when scientific consensus told us the Earth was flat? But certainly NOW we know everything right? We haven’t even colonized space yet so no one can claim they are above it all.

I almost 30 and I am a cyber security researcher if that helps. I also experiment with high end game tech.

He's talking be muttering to himself as he draws and erases things, like he's planning something. I hear the words ""heart"", ""arrow"", ""through"" and ""ace of spades"". After a lot of scribbling and erasing, Bob stands up shouting in triumph then scrambles over to a dark area, which in assuming to get started. Fade out. 

Next minute, I'm sitting in a reception area that looks strangely like the one in my old high school. It's crowded. People are dressed nicely and there's a lot of art magazines around. I pick one up and realise I am at an art show opening. The program has a painting on the cover, full of grey, white, black and dark red brush strokes. 

Suddenly, people start filing through an opening. The exhibition is large and the space is full of nooks. Wandered around with a glass of sparkling wine in hand, and kind of interested in what I see. 

I end up finding the piece ""Bob"" was trying to create, which was large and needed to be suspended. There was long, thin, gold looking arrow shaft splicing through half a dozen metal cut outs of the ace of spades. The arrow shaft curled in wide, stretched out hoops. I follow along and find the head of the arrow nails a red heart. 

The format of the dream reminds me of a Frasier/The Simpsons episode but without the regular cast. Which is so surreal. 

In real life, I'm looking for a new job and have found out my employer is advertising internally, thinking about applying for the vacancy. 

Could the dream be about work or about relationships, because the symbolism reminds me of Cupid shooting arrows. 

Thanks.

0.0,9gq3cr,2.0,2.0,"Okay so I'm having this recurring dream about a guy, three nights in a row. The dream is always set in my town during the zombie apocalypse. When I see it on the news, he comes knocking on my door asking if we can hang out. He's always wearing the same white t-shirt with a measure of music on it. On top there are two words that I assume is his first and last name. But I can't tell because it's always blurred out. Anyway, I tell him the apocalypse was starting and he needed to go home and protect himself. He does and I always blow him a kiss when he leaves. Now the thing is, *I'm a lesbian who is still trying to figure out her gender.* So I'm not sure why I do that. So about a couple of 'dream days' go by and he comes back. This time in an entirely new get up. When he comes back he's wearing military fatigues, (either Marine or Army I'm not entirely sure), and he has a crossbow. His name is on the uniform but again, it's blurred out. I give him a hug which is a full body hug. (He's tall, so my head reaches his chest.) Now the first time I had this dream he's been already smoking a cigarette and he's just gave me a hit of it. But for the last two nights he just gives one straight from the pack- and it's always full. That's as far as consistency goes. I tried drawing him but I'm not good at realism drawing so he doesn't look like himself in the dream when I draw him in my style. 

Here are the things I remember about him feature wise: 

\-He has either brown eyes or blue eyes

\-His hair is almost a dark blonde

\-My head reaches his chest so he's taller than I am

\-He's Caucasian (White)

When I told my friend, (we'll call him A), about this, he told me, ""It could be you turning straight, and this is your future husband."" (It's not A in the dream, he's only a couple of inches taller than me and he's Puerto Rican.) When we went through the list and we have a slight suspicion it could be my friend, who we'll call B. Who pretty much matches the description but he doesn't smoke and he's a bit of a germaphobe. So we ruled him out. I'm a bit of a smoker, only once in a great while when I find a cigarette but I've never smoked weed. I'm also Native American, my tribe is Navajo. 

I'm not entirely sure what this dream means, could my friend be right? Or does it mean something else? Answers would be very much appreciated. Thank you!

This one however got to me, because it was so detailed in the fact that everything made sense, so much so it felt like it was real, to an extent.

I am outside, at my house talking to my mom and dad, then I see these 4 white figures coming from the interstate we live next to. I can't really make out what they are, but they are too small to be any person or car. They get closer, and I realize that they are some breed of albino monkeys I presume. I wonder what they were doing out here, but before I had time to react I noticed that something was strange about them, they looked pissed off for some reason. They had this terrifying loud, deep scream that would make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. They then began to run at us. My mom got in my dad's truck, and when I was opening the door, something came out of its eyes. I looked back and there was a hole melted clean into the door. So right now, we have escaped lab primates, with heat vision. Seems like a nightmare to me. But the story doesn't end there. Not only did they have this heat vision, but when they opened their mouths, some type of green gas came out, that I could only assume to be some type of toxic gas. We ran to my truck, got in, and I grabbed a rifle out of it, fired a few times in the air to scare them off. The dream was so realistic, the warning sound when you are about to back into something went off when I almost backed into a wall. But the dream doesn't end there. I woke up in the dream, and was so terrified, that I looked up the type of monkey, because for some reason I knew what species it was. The first article that popped up, was an experiment on a group of albino monkeys had gone wrong and led to a vicious attack on a government testing facility. At that point I woke up, in a panicked state.

I kept hearing a women's voice saying he was doing good and behaving. He was being such a good dog just sitting by my side as this woman kept talking to me. I couldn't really see her completely but I could hear her. I noticed in the background of the house I was looking into I noticed one of my other dogs who died a few years ago. He was blurry though and I couldn't really see him.

The lady stopped talking and my dog went inside her house and she shut the door. I woke up right after really confused.

So for the past few days when he was gone I was so sad, wondering what happened to him and I’m kinda waiting for him to comeback tho I am not sure if he will comeback.

After a few days he did cameback and he was saying sorry and said he really was in the hospital for the past few days coz he got sick. So my guess was right.

I guess I just pretended to because I always wanted to astral so I played along with the dream. At one point I talked to a bird that was flying in front of me. I'm pretty sure it was a crow.

We were in an very long house and my grandparents came over. i went with my grandfather down the stairs which led underground here the weird horror kicked in, we were walking along the long almost neverending underground system that was right under the house and neared the end. at the end we saw a teddy bear (i dont know what it means) and ran very frightened back being followed by some kind of demon (now that i'm thinking of it it kinda looks like a demon from the old doom game only pretty lifelike and big and fast), i do remember it were more then 1. so we made it back and there is this weird program on tv i watched yesterday called utopia (dutch) and some people of the show were also in that house. so back to the demon thing, now it gets pretty weird as dreams can take all kinds of crazy turns. i dont know why but there were these uhm metal shooting target in the form of mostly a person you sometimes see in games and stuff but in the form of the demon chasing me and somehow i needed to jump on them (there were multiple). so back to the house everyone was having some sort of mental breakdown (no i am not on the edge of having a mental breakdown.... Or at least i think). 
So it was a real sh*tfest and had a very weird feeling. I also vaguely remember everyone going into a room with some sort of computer A.I which i also needed to do, the rest i don't really remember. so nearing the end of my dream i was having a pretty good time with someone from that show (which i find very annoying irl) but she did something or say something which pissed me off so madly, i think she straight up hit me with her fists and i got in an uncontrollable rage and headbutted her to death (yeah.....). and before i woke up so still in my dream i remember my mother coming to me and seeing her laying dead on the floor. but she kept very calm and only asked me how we were going to fix this as her parents would be picking her up soon. and then i woke up thankfully but i needed to get my grip with reality again so i went for a pee got on the couch next to my lovely dog and typed this.

Sunday night, I had a tough time getting to sleep. I was picking up on some pretty intense energies that night, and believe that influenced the several dreams that I had. Two of which were very violent. I was either fending off attackers in my home, or finding my dog mortally wounded. I shook those off as nightmares, but the next dream I had was profound, vivid, and very detailed. 

I was standing in the middle of a plain. In front of me was the San Juan mountain range either in Colorado or New Mexico, I can't remember the peaks well enough to work out a precise location. As far as I could see, there were no buildings, or any other indication of human settlement. Surrounding me was a pack of wild dogs.

Last night I slept for 4 hours before waking up at 6am. I didn't think much of it other than how scary the last part was, which I will explain later on. I fell back asleep about half an hour later. What made the second dream so weird was that it began with me downloading my dream from my pillow onto my phone. The dream downloaded was 4 hours long. As I started watching it, I realized that I was rewatching my last dream. Everything was the same other than my screen fuzzing up occasionally, as if there was some bad connection. I was also making comments on my dream, as if I was explaining it to myself, but I don't remember any of them. It started with a man and a woman walking through the grass with castles behind them. They walked into the castle and met with a king who was sitting on a throne held up my four men. The king took their baby from them and put it in a compartment in a suitcase that already had 5 other children in it. I'm not sure if this part meant anything, but I wanted to include it just incase. 

The next part I remember was sitting at a desk in my room with my friend. We were chatting about something on my desk when I got an alert on my phone. It said ""POTENTIAL TSUNAMI WARNING NEXT WEEK."" I didn't think anything of it since my house is pretty far up from sea level. Skip to a few days later. I was sitting in my room when I got another warning that was government issued. It said ""APOCALYPSE IN TWO DAYS, NOT A DRILL."" I panicked and went downstairs to see my parents. They said they weren't worried and that it's probably a hoax, but I told them it isn't a hoax if it's coming from the government and is all over the news.

After spending my last couple of days hooking up with random guys and no longer caring about the future, I found myself in a car heading home. It was nighttime, and I was riding shotgun with a girl I don't know. We were driving by the ocean and about to take a turn inland when all of the lights in the car started going crazy. An alarm was blaring through the speakers. Looking around, I saw the same happening in the vehicles surrounding us. A tsunami warning alarm was booming throughout the entire town. Suddenly, a man's voice came through our car's speakers. It said, and this is word for word, ""If we don't survive this, thank you for the wonderful experience that was being a part of the human race. May we not be forgotten.""

I told the girl driving to step on the gas so we could get as far away from the ocean as possible. I thought that if we could get further inland then we would have a better chance of surviving. She was afraid, so I floored it myself and everyone around us was doing the same. People were crashing into each other and cars were piling up. A car clipped our front bumper and we did a 360 before coming to a halt. In front of us was a barricade of cars that had crashed in the panic. There was no way out, and we prepared for the worst. We held each other and closed our eyes, not wanting to witness the wall of water that would inevitably take our lives.

The car shifted and the sound destruction surrounded us. Then, it was silent. We slowly opened our eyes to see everything around us looked the same, but different. It seemed like someone had put a slight photo filter on reality. I teared up and laughed, exclaiming ""We made it. I can't believe we fucking made it."" The joy we felt was indescribable, but short lived. I looked out at the road and saw a few air bubbles escape from underneath the hood.

We were completely underwater.

It felt so unfair. Instead of a quick, possibly instant death, we had to experience the idea that we survived and the hope that humankind was still intact, only to have it ripped away from us. Our tears were no longer happy tears. I looked up to see how deep we were, but I couldn't tell. I held the girl one last time and wished her good luck on her journey to the surface, but I knew that even if we made it, we had nowhere to go. We would either drown or die of starvation/dehydration/etc. I opened the window and swam up, holding my breath for as long as I could. When I realized I wouldn't make it, I exhaled and inhaled. I was absolutely shocked. I wasn't drowning, I was breathing! It was in that moment that I woke up, in both the first and the second dream.

I don't know what this means, or if it means anything at all, but I'd like to know either way. It won't leave my mind. There must be some kind of message in this. Thank you.",top,I had the same dream twice in one night that ended with an apocalypse and an ending with a twist,2.0

i cant remember exactly how it started, so i'll start it from where i remember. i was in my girlfriend's room (glg relationship), her and her family weren't there so it was me sitting at her desk and my dad on her bed. my mom and stepdad were downstairs, far away from my girlfriend's room. he was saying horrible things to me that i can't remember, but i continued doing whatever i was doing at her desk, ignoring his comments. then, he mentioned that he would give me my phone back if i gave him my passwords to all of my social medias, saying how he doesn't even know who i am anymore but maybe he'd learn a thing or two about me by the things i post (this was all in a demeaning, extremely negative way, and he was implying that he'd discover i was bisexual and dating a girl if he looked through my things). i told him no, and that i didn't need a phone at the cost of him learning everything about me. next thing i remember, i'm sitting on his lap, and he's gripping my shoulders really tightly. i'm sure it hurt but i don't remember feeling anything in this dream. he was screaming in my face, like he has many times in my life. i remember mid sentence i bit his tongue, intending to rip it out of his mouth, but it wouldnt budge. it was like elastic, my teeth weren't even making a dent. he just couldn't speak, but it was like he was still yelling. he wasn't reacting to what i was doing. then, we're on the ground, he's on his stomach and im on his back holding him down somehow. i grabbed his phone, calling 911 and the call immediately failing to go through. same thing happens when i call my mom. the door became closed and locked at some point during thi, i believe it was when he started screaming at me, but im not sure exactly when it happened. then i grabbed my phone, calling my mom. i told her to call the police, to which the door opened and i could turn my head to see my mom and stepdad running upstairs to me. i remember punching my dad a few times in the head, trying to knock him out so he couldn't do anything, but i cant remember if i was successful or not. 

i remember standing up, and for some reason, i only had my dad's head in my hands. my parents stood in the doorway, and i dropped the head, but then the rest of his body appeared on the floor. his head landed just right to where it would line up with his neck and body, and his eyes opened and he immediately made eye contact with me. nobody was reacting in this situation, i'm not even sure if i actually killed him in my dream or not.

the last bit i remember is my mom, stepdad, and i were all in the car driving away. i don't recognize my surroundings, like we're in a different town/city or state, and it was raining. i got onto my mom's phone (i don't have a phone at this current moment) and i saw an article, showing a picture of my dad terrorizing a family from an aerial view. the lot of land seemed to be flooded, like it was a natural disaster, and the family was barely visible inside their garage in the picture. it appeared that my dad was running towards them, and he looked absolutely batshit crazy. the article read 'crazed man terrorizing florida families', so i'm not sure if this point was a while after the whole ordeal, or if it was merely an hour after it happened. time doesn't really exist in dreams from my experiences, so it could have been anything.

this is the second dream in which i've had that involved my dad being the enemy and coming after me. i can't consider these nightmares though, because when i wake up, i'm fine, but if i have a nightmare, i wake up in an absolute panic. from the research i've done today, this dream is telling me i'm becoming like my father and i'm fighting it with everything i have, but i don't have the right tools to help myself, pushing me to murder and physically hurting him. a lot of his toxic and volatile behavior has seeped into me, making me not a nice person to my mom and some of my friends, and i'm now working on trying to fix and better myself. anything else would be highly appreciated.",top,Had a somewhat violent dream involving my father,2.0

I tend to have dreams about the future of our civilisation around 300 years in the future (just guessing).

It is always dark during the night. I am in one of the last floors of a skyscraper, the walls and windows are all made of glass,  there are not light bulbs , only blue and purple bulb lights. Everything else it is quite dark, it is full of people, maybe it is like a bar? or maybe a party of some kind?. Everybody is talking and laughing except me.

 I also see weird lights going around in the far away on the sky.

Then there is like a countdown but no one knows about it, it is a negative countdown inside my own head, I feel very anxious, and....like if I had to get out of that building immediately , unfortunately I can't go out from there on time and all starts shaking,  nobody knows  what it is happening, we think it is a earthquake but then I thought what if it is an explosion?.

During the shaking, the far away weird lights on the sky get closer and become into alien ships shooting flashes lights on the city which is all dark, (it seems than in my dream I am not allowed to see anything else from the future architecture) then the building starts to fall down and people starts to scream.

The dream become into a second dream with a different story but I am outside of a building and I start running from someone but it has nothing to do with the first dream, so I guess I died in the first dream?.

What do you think?, I am really confused. I had that dream years ago but it still makes me nervous and makes me to think what the he'll was that?.",top,Building falling down,2.0

This is my first post in this thread. I had a really vivid dream the other night that's really been weighing heavily on me and I wanted to get some thoughts on it. 

In my dream, there was this ethereal being following me everywhere. I would feel her over my shoulder wherever I went. She appeared to be an innocent little girl, dressed in Victorian style clothing with curly hair. However, if I looked at her for too long, she turned into something much more sinister. Her eyes rolled back in her head to where I could only see the whites of her eyes, her pretty hair turned gnarled and she grew several feet in height until she was taller than me. Her mouth opened to revel a mouthful of fangs, and her head hung at an odd angle on her neck. And then she rushed me.

I started to try to run from this creature. For some reason, I went to my parents' house in the dream, which is odd because I don't talk to them (IRL or in the dream). I find out that my mother has been conjuring the monster and sending it after me as ""punishment"" for disobeying her. 

We fled back to Boston to try to escape it. The monster tried to hurt my husband, but we knocked it down together and ran. We were staying with a friend in Boston, and the creature attacked him. 

I have been sick IRL and I woke from the dream due to coughing and it felt like the monster was in the room with me. ",top,Mom sending Demon after me,2.0

I'm not sure if all of the dreams are similar, but there's one part of the dream that sticks with me every time.

&#x200B;

I'm gonna do my best to explain the main part that i remember every time.

&#x200B;

So.. In these dreams, i'm in some sort of public building - be it hotels, schools, workplaces, etc.

All i can remember is that i'm going to the bathroom, and i'm having a hard time finding it, and usually have to walk very far into parts of the building where there's no people. It's almost as if the closer i get to the bathroom, the fewer people there is around me.

&#x200B;

When i finally find the bathroom, which is usually in a weird place that doesn't make much sense, i enter it. It's this slightly old, very very long public bathroom, with ALOT of stalls, sinks, and a mirror on the wall that goes far down the hall. Always empty and dead silent. 

It feels almost like i've entered another dimension, and that i'm locked in, with no one else able to enter.

It all seems like a toned down version of Silent Hill.

&#x200B;

Every time when i start to go about my business on the toilet, i suddenly remember that i've been in that room before.

&#x200B;

I think in one of my first versions of this dream, i saw this creepy little girl at the other side of it, but i don't think i see that every time. Atleast i don't recall actually seeing anything supernatural in my last dream. I think i woke up pretty soon after i remembered which dream it was.

&#x200B;

Anyway.. it's very weird. Just thought i'd share.

Wondering what it means? Maybe i just have an underlying fear of this scenario.. but it's oddly specific each time.

I was in a Spanish war-torn country. Militia were around and most everyone carried guns. We were there to capture children because they were worth $50,000. The people in the dream that were white were people I don’t know personally. 

The first scene was a southern Baptist style church. This makes sense cause I grew up southern Baptist. I was in the pulpit at the beginning of the service and looked at the handout. I was the main speaker. The piano started playing and the choir sang. I don’t recall anyone in the church except me, the African-American choir and the other black pastor. (I am white)

This second part is where things get weird.  The church service was outside on a trailer. All sides were open with a view of the city streets. Roads were tight and this time I recognized one person. It was a student that I teach at school. Everyone in the pulpit had a gun. The plan was the do a surprise attack into the city to take children. In the dream, I became anxious and did not want to participate. 

It started happening. The people poured into the street shooting people and taking children. I ran the opposite direction. One scene that keeps replaying is a tight spot with a fence and a school bus making a narrow street. I turn down it and it is a dead end with three children. They know what’s happening. I begun shuffling out the other way. I run to a safe house of sorts with Latino people sitting there. I speak broken Spanish to them but we hear “Police”. I hit the ground. This white woman gets up that looks like a decorated soldier. She looks at me and says, “either lay on your face or come with me”. I get up and walk past the police with her into the streets. 

Now it looks like London. I’ve never been but from pictures that’s the closest I can think. A buddy I lived with in college comes up and he’s showing me the things he had bought. We see a bus leaving and I woke up.

Okay so I won’t go into the boring details, but I had a best friend as a child (we’ll call him Shane) and when I was nine I was in a bad car accident and had to change schools, so we lost contact for a few years but got back in contact through Facebook when we were about 13. 
Fast forward to us at 15 and we’re closer than ever, self proclaimed brother and sister, but then he gets a girlfriend. 
He’s infatuated with this girl, totally obsessed, but she treats him like shit, every other week I’d have him crying down the phone to me because she cheated on him AGAIN. 
But he won’t leave her, and eventually he ends our friendship because she doesn’t like the way we talk (she probably felt threatened, we were very open about how much we loved each other (as friends, nothing more))

Long story short, he blocks me on facebook, blocks my number and blocks all my friends’ facebooks so I have absolutely no way of contacting him. It truly broke my heart. 

So that’s what leads to now, seven years later. 
For years now I’ve dreamt about Shane every few months like clockwork, and I guess I’m just wondering why?
It’s emotionally and mentally exhausting to constantly have my brain bring up someone from my past that I’m trying to forget, reminding me of a person who once meant so much to me that I’ll  likely never see again. 

Does anyone have any idea why this keeps happening? Or even any tips to stop it?

I was with my adopted baby sister more happened before, but I can’t remember. I think I was watching her? Anyway my mom came home and I told her I wanted to help adopt a cat for my little sister.

So we get in this Jeep and drive. There are sections for different animals, but i saw none, just knew they were there. And my sister is talking about animals while throwing a plush pig up in the air and down saying maybe she should get x instead of a cat or x. As we get towards the “cat” part I start seeing dead lions (male) and one was hanging like someone was gutting it like a deer. 

I looked at my mom and said “somethings not right” then see a lion roaring. “Go to the car!” And suddenly I have this huge gun. I shot one shot off and I missed, but in the scope I noticed I shot the same time as a man (the lion was like more or less warning me I feel) so I started shooting at the man because in my head I was like “fuck You, they were just trying to live!” Anyway so I hit the guy in the arm and start running to the Jeep as my mom was driving off (somehow made it) and I saw a lioness (or maybe a tiger?) in a bush who roared but it looked like a sad roar?). And then I look back to see this heavy set lady running at us trying to shoot us. So I shoot back.

&#x200B;

I was inside a general store at around midnight, or at least late enough for it to be completely pitch black outside. Someone runs inside and tells me to come look at what's happening outside, so I run out with him to check out what's going on. I can remember the feeling of dread that came over me as I saw masses of... something coming out of what looked like a portal in the clouds, all I could see was their silhouettes on the dim red light coming down from the clouds as the huge things flooded down to earth by the hundreds. It looked like some of them had attached to the roofs of some of the high-rise buildings in the distance with some kind of fleshy rope and were reeling themselves down. When some of them flew over the parking lot where I was, they started spewing out columns of fire, lighting up the entire area in huge flames and barely missing me. My car was also still intact on the other side of the parking lot, but the flames were blocking me from getting to it. Oddly enough, I called up some kind of valet service and they brought my car to me within a second, even though there were flames blocking anyone from getting to it. Without questioning it, I got in and drove home. That's all I can remember up to, so I assume that's where it ended.

&#x200B;

Later that night, I had another dream that was fairly short-lived, and seemed to be a ""prologue"" for the first. I didn't seem to be present there myself, it was like I was just watching everything happen from a third-person perspective. It was centered around a large monster sitting in the water which seemed to be the ""king"" of those other monsters, and it was broad daylight rather than night. It was friendly at first, even saying that it didn't mean any harm. Only a few moments after, a demon flew past my point of view and into the monster, turning its blue skin into a dark red as it started to raise out of the water. That's where that one ended.

I (F23) had gotten pregnant and my long term boyfriend (M22) of 6+ years broke up with me, but I don’t think he knew I was pregnant. I was wandering around the different dorms at my old university trying to find a good place to hide and cry and figure out what I was going to do now but people were everywhere having a fun time. I didn’t want them to see me cry because it was sad and embarrassing so I kept running but it was all dead ends and I kept having to backtrack. Eventually I found a movie theater and while there were still lots of people in there, I figured it would get dark and loud enough that no one would see at least and I’d have a few hours. 
So I’m looking for a seat and I see my boyfriend sitting there with his arm around some girl that looks just like me, a doppelgänger almost (but I didn’t think that word in the dream). She was all put together and nice looking. He had started to date her already and they were all cute and sweet together and he was laughing with her, having fun at the movies I was trying to hide in so I left as fast as I could before they saw me. When I got outside the theater it was like my high school (where we met if that’s relevant but it often makes an appearance) so I walked over and I got on the rail line at the closest stop and it turned into a train in a small town I spent a summer in. We were going to the next stop when these officers in black navy uniforms got on and were looking for me. I didn’t think to hide and wasn’t scared at first just sad. Then they dragged me away to a strange basement and locked me down there so I wouldn’t harm the baby even though I hadn’t been thinking about it really and then now that I remembered it I was scared and didn’t want to be pregnant with my now exboyfriend. They threw me in a basement that was completely dark, wet, and cold. I felt like I was so heavy I couldn’t lift myself off the icy damp floor.
Then I saw up in a tall corner a rectangle of light that turned out to be a doorway. My boyfriend and his new girlfriend (my doppelgänger) had come to check on me. I could only see their silhouettes mostly and it hurt my eyes, the light was so bright it was like it had been days since I’d seen anything in that darkness. He had his arm around her shoulders holding her close and protective while she looked down towards me with a tortured, empathetic look on her face. When I begged them to help me it scared her and she started to tear up so he gently turned her head towards his chest and held her tightly, stroking her hair and lead her away from the doorway. He never looked at me once and I heard him apologize to her as he closed the door and it was all dark again. 
I didn’t see or hear them or anyone else after that and was left in darkness for a long time. I felt like I had been there and would always be there so I gave up and let my soul leave my body in that dark basement so there was nothing and my body could just rot in peace.

Out of one of the crevices, I see part of an older  man's face (mostly the left cheekbone and eye), and it just stares at me. After a little bit of time in the dream I sit on the couch, and I'm slowly just engulfed in hands( like that one room in Silent Hill 3 with the room wide mirror?). And whenever I'm fully engulfed, the dream ends and I just wake up drenched in sweat. 

I should mention that most of the dream is from my first person point of view, but as soon as I sit on the couch it's a 3rd person view, like I set down a video camera, looked through it, recorded the couch, and then sat down without moving the camera if you can imagine it

0.0,96hm8l,2.0,2.0,"I am living in Saudi Arabia with a host family and am becoming fluent in the culture and language. I am then taken to a hospital by the wife for a general health check-up. We are waiting in a room and a nurse approaches me and lifts my shirt up. She asks if I am pregnant and I tell her I am not, that I am just a bit chubby. But I feel incredibly violated that this nurse is handling me in front of an entire waiting room. Still, she insists on checking my belly and has a doctor bring a cart into the waiting room. As I'm standing with my host, they do an ultrasound and sure enough, I am pregnant, but only a few months in. I start freaking out because there is no way I could be pregnant (I've had no sex) and I had just had my period, etc.  

I immediately fly home because I am scared of this sudden pregnancy and want to be nearer to friends. Sadly, nobody believes that I didn't have sex and then claim I am a liar. Suddenly, I am giving birth to this child just a few days after returning from Saudi Arabia. Remember, I'm only supposed to be a few months in. I give birth and realize just how cute and sweet my child is. I fall in love with the child and absolutely adore them. BUT, when my child is only 2 days old, they start speaking in full sentences, are capable of communication and understanding complex emotions, and have grown as tall as a 4-year-old. My child is also a hermaphrodite. 

Nobody is blinking an eye at this birth or the circumstances, but I understand that this birth and child are odd.   

Now, I still love this child and because they are a hermaphrodite, I have to decide which gender they are (according to the doctor). BUT my child can speak and convey thoughts and feelings. I tell the doctor I have to speak with my child and that they will make the choice based on how they feel. Flash forward: I am bathing my child and am asking how they personally identify. My child looks super confused and I can sense worry on their face. I try my best to explain they must choose so that the doctor can adjust their genitalia accordingly. As I am saying this, I am realizing how fucked up it is to even think that this is an okay thing to ask or an okay procedure to conduct. My child is standing next to me a robe and sweetly asks "" Shy can't I be a girl AND a boy."" They start crying and I am doing my best to assure them that they can be both and that they will not be seeing the doctor. 

I begin to feed my child and decide I should take them out for some fun. They seem to appreciate trinkets and so I give them a $40 allowance for antiquing. My child is having a blast looking at a case of stones, jewels, and baubles. They pick out several items, above the allowance, but the shopkeeper only charges the total amount my child has. Everything this child has picked is a gift for somebody else, nothing for themselves. The item they picked for me is a blue sparkly gemstone. People waiting in line as my child gifts me the stone are staring at us and I become hyper-aware of their presence. An older lady asks how old my daughter is and I realize my child is female presenting. I explain that my child really is 4 days old and that they identify as both male and female.

Suddenly, I remember that I had been learning some mechanical skills under a car a few days prior to my hospital visit. And I remember that a black widow nest had been under the cab of the car and that I had to avoid it, but had brushed against this huge nest, causing me to get out of the damn garage. I remembered having a bite on my arm and so, in dream world logic, the ""father"" of my child was a spider.  
 
I leave my child to play with their trinkets under the watch of the store owner. I end up in a sex club, where you pay a flat fee of $40 and get to move between rooms (in the order they say), spending 40 minutes in each room.

The first room has a man lying on a bed and we just lay facing one another, lightly touching each other's skin. When I go down, I notice that his penis has two heads that split to form a heart. After my time is up with this man, I enter the second room and there are three men finishing their time with another woman. Watching what they are doing gets me hyped for my session. However, I am disappointed because what they have in store for me is to bathe in front of them and then clean this sewer pothole naked. I get super pissed and then wake up.

I'm laying in bed with my SO. Nothing abnormal; she's asleep, the dog and cat are asleep. I look to the bedroom doorway, and there's a backward man. He's about 6' 4"", medium/ large build, wearing a hat and casual clothes, but everything's backward (think: Kriss Kross). I know he's ""facing"" me, but I'm looking at the back of his head. He starts to walk ""forward"" to the foot of the bed. His gate is the same as someone walking forward normally, but his body is facing the other direction. Then, 666 appears across him. 

I never see his face, but I know he's a white man, mid 30s, I've never met him, and he doesn't seem actively aggressive. More mild-mannered. 

He slowly walks to the foot of the bed, then I wake up. 

I don't wake up in a panic, it's more of a, ""well, that's odd,"" then back to sleep. Normally, if I dream of something satanic, I'm a lost cause for sleep that night, but this didn't seem frightening at the time (which may make it all the more frightening in the daylight).

I work at a FreshCO grocery store in real life and have a strong desire to chase storms. I love weather. As for my job, I dislike it but I love the people who work there. I am quitting soon to pursue a career in academia.

The first memorable events of this dream were work as normal at FreshCO. I remember this part down to the common work banter that I hear at work. We complained about our head office bosses and the owner of the store as usual. There were radios everywhere in the store telling us that there were severe thunderstorms coming. I went into the Sales floor and it was covered in smoke. So we evacuated the store and called 911. All the workers retreated to a (fictional), bathroom showcase store that was awaiting full construction to hide from the storm. I used one of the bathroom facilities  and the FreshCO had burnt down when I was finished. The storms were bad and we were all eating fresh radishes. My coworkers and I left in a truck to chase storms and the radio told us that there were tornadoes everywhere from Oklahoma to my city (which is in Canada). My coworkers and I drove outside a small town called Hanama (also fictional). Hqnama was a French speaking town and we couldn't understand.d their radios but it was about o take a direct hit from a tornado. So we drove away and eventually our car broke down and into pieces. So we ran alm the way back to my house. My whole family was there waiting out the storms. A tornado came by and narrowly missed my home. However I left and watching a beautiful tornado destroy my home with all my co workers a.d my family inside. The emotions that I felt here were happiness. The rest is foggy but I remember one last detail. I remember pulling the souls of the people who died in my home out of a tornado. And I walked up a huge spiral staircase that was around a tornado to do this. 

A note about recurrent themes:

I often have recurrent dreams about storm chasing or tornadoes. They're often apocalyptic in nature, destroying a piece of my life (like a city or specific item or killing a person). As for fires I used to dream about venturing through burning forests when I was younger. And for work, I almost never dream about it but when I do, usually they're just fleeting narratives rather than profound experiences. ",top,Dream about storm chasing and fires.,2.0

people call the hall monitor, something my school never had the investigator.
The school is pretty much just this hallway, all doors repeat to the start. Kids keep going into doors to report to their class and I start to panic because I cant get out this hallway, eventually all kids get into their class and it's just me and the investigator.

My(f) ex and I broke up a few years ago and it was quite messy, we haven't spoken since our breakup. He is newly married and according to a mutual friend, not very happy. Recently, the night before his wedding (which I didn't know about at the time), I had a dream that he ran into a room crying. He said ""I know you want me to marry (my name) but I just cant"". He then looked over at me and I was smiling as though nothing was wrong. After that, he ran into a room with the word ""therapy"" on the door"".

So, I've been under a lot of stress lately. Taking on a new and very serious job, trying to find a new place to live, battling with whether or not I should blow off this job and finish my college education.. the whole shebang really. On top of that I deal with depression and anxiety, which I take medication for but I feel lately it's doing nothing. I also have been sleep talking a hell of a whole lot lately, as far as I know I never have up until last week.   


On to the dream, I guess.  


Last night/early this morning I had a VERY vivid dream of being in a human-like form, but I knew I wasn't necessarily a person. I also knew that my body was made out of some sort of crystal or gemstone and could see it within my limbs by  faint glow whenever I moved slightly. I was floating through black and eventually came upon two very tall/long pillars of light. Every now and then they would sort of glitch and I would see what they really looked like. They took on feminine forms and ""held"" me between them. It wasn't so much holding as it was my body floating close between the two. I do distinctly remember that their eyes were massive, round, and shaped like what you would think of when you tried to picture a stereotypical alien. I felt safe, I felt loved, more than any point ever in my life. Honestly, I'm getting teary-eyed right now just thinking about it.   


After that I woke up in a sweat and felt a little disoriented, once again something that rarely happens to me. I started doing research maybe an hour or so ago and I'm coming up with A LOT and I mean a lot of metaphysical explanations. I'm very on the fence about that sort of stuff, but I really want to make some sort of sense of this.

As time has gone on (progressed about 2 weeks now) it’s gotten more and more violent. 
While napping with said boyfriend yesterday, I had a dream where he violently beat me after searching the building for hours for me. He beat me within an inch of my life, but I still got away and found my way home.

0.0,90h3sa,0.0,2.0,"I just woke up and am typing these two weird dream sup before I forget them.
 For background I am 19 years old, female, transferring to a new college next month(First ever Dorming experience). Forever single.

The first dream was that me and my family and my best friend were on a huge ship, like an old fashioned pirate ship sort of ship. We were in the middle of a huge dark blue ocean. We decided to go swimming and the waters soon became stormy and wild. My parents put down a long rope for us to climb up to get out of the water. I climbed up first and waited anxiously for my brother and friend to come up next. Then I noticed a shape in the water, it was a giant sea monster almost as big as the boat, like a prehistoric swimming rhino thing. I kept hoping at least my brother or my friend would be safe, and them I thought I saw it eat my friend and I was guiltily a tiny bit relived that at least it hadn't eaten my brother, but in real life I don't like my brother that much and like my best friend better. so my brother got up the rope an I was very distraught that my friend didn't make it and waited to see if maybe I saw wrong. Then something even weirder happened, the dream transitioned to dry land, the boat was now my house and the ocean was land with a circular play ground in the middle and like an empty plain with some trees and bushed scattered about. So I went outside, I'm not sure why, and encountered the monster with was now the size of maybe a lion, like slightly smaller than I real life rhino, and it could talk. It told me that it got mad when people laughed because it felt made fun of and that it could not pass anything made of metal once someone laughed and then ran from it. I made sure not to laugh and slowly backed away but it like slowly followed my movements. So I decided I needed to run and I needed to make It mad so it couldn't think straight and cleverly catch me. So I laughed at it and then ran to the circular play-ground close to my house which was surrounded by a meal pole fence so the monster could not get through. then I had an idea, I though maybe my fried wasn't eaten, she is really smart so maybe she knew how to escape the monster. I called out her name hopefully, and I heard her weak voice calling out my name from inside the play structure. I went over and found her she looked really weak and skinny so I picked her up and told her about the monster and its weakness. It turns out that she knew about the monster and its weakness because her mother is from Italy and its an urban legend there, and thats how she escaped it. So I told her to laugh when I said so and that I was gonna run as fast as I could to my house and then we'd be safe. So we both laughed as loud as we could and then I ran as fast as humanly possible and we made it to my house and I locked all the doors and we were safe. Then my father got a shotgun and decided to go out and kill the monster. 

Thats the first dream, I honestly can not say its the weirdest dream iv'e ever had, but it's gotta rank up there. I need to start writing my dreams down right when I was up more often, because I remember them a few times a week for a small amount of time after I wake up.

The second dream was shorter. 

I was on an island I think, or it may have been just a beach area, not sure. I was waiting in line for something I'm not sure for what, but I think it was like a boat or ferry.  Anyway the line was very long, I was closer to the front then the people behind me, but it went on for a long time way. There were two boys waiting in front of me, the same age as me probably. One of them made a sexual joke directed at me and I told him off, but both the boys just snickered. I got annoyed and I was bored and I didn't want to wait on line for so long with those two annoying boys right in front of me for so long, so I decided to explore the Island, or beach or whatever it was. I went up a hill and there was a large stone structure as tall as a building. There was high dry grass and I saw a hill that you could see the boat that everyone was waiting for from. I started going down the hill leaning on the stone structure to lead my way. All of a sudden a bunch of native people pop up from the grass, they look like maybe amazon native, they have bowl cuts, dark skin, bone necklaces and are only dressed in loin cloths, both women and men. They have these large thin bow and arrows and they all point them at me. I freak out and put my hands up and say sorry i'll leave if you want, please don't hurt me, I'll leave, I didn't mean to trespass. I just repeat it over and over hoping maybe they will understand. So once of the natives, I guess someone in charge grins and they all put their weapons down, he says its okay just tell us why you're here. I told them how I was waiting in line and two boys were making me uncomfortable so I decided to explore. They said they understood and then patted me on the shoulder. Right after somehow the two boys showed up, and the natives surrounded them and pointed their arrows at them. The said they would punish the boys for being so crass. The boys looked at me and were like why would you tell them what we did, they might hurt us! I kind of felt bad, I didn't want them to be killed for just a joke, no matter how annoying and gross it was. But I told them I was sorry and I did it to save myself and there was nothing I could do. I did ask the natives to leave them alone but they wouldn't listen to me, and then they pushed me to the ground ad started digging a hole and said they had to bury the virgin! (Me) They started covering me in dirt and I was like hell no, but they held me down, I guess I was a human sacrifice? Any way I was struggling and the boys were like wtf and then there was a really strong breeze and the bows and arrows got moved by the wind to be pointing away and the boys knocked away some of them and I took my bag and swung it at the ones trying to bury me and then all three of us ran back toward the line as fast as humanly possible and we were being chased by them. Basically somehow we commandeered a flying machine, it was kind of like a paraglider but also an airplane but open to the elements. They apologized to me for being idiots and I said it was fine we just escaped this crazy life and death situation all is forgiven. It was literally like an adventure comic, we like rode into the horizon laughing with adrenaline. Even though the dream sort of ended there, as far as I can remember I had the feelings that we were all good friends now, and this situation had bonded us, and we would stay friends and maybe go on more adventures. It was a very happy feeling. 

So those are the two dreams that I remember from last night, if anyone can give me some insight on to what they think some of it may mean, I would be very happy. Even if you just have an idea about one of the dreams, or just even one part or one, let me know :)",top,2 very odd dreams last night,2.0

Anyway, I had a dream where I was walking trough unknown town with narrow streets and I was approaching a group of worried people. When I came closer to them I noticed that they were all looking at something on the ground and they were either schoked or trying not to even look at the road directly. So, I came to the front and saw a crashed car, and two dead blonde girls lying on the ground (they were couple of feet apart from each other-the girl on the left was covered up but I could see her head and arm, and the girl on the right had blood on her head). I was very confused and couldn't look away so a man pushed me, gave me angry look and said to me ""Stop looking, go away!"" And I did. I walked into very narrow and small street and it started to get crowded very quickly, I tripped on a small rock and fell to the ground. Nobody noticed that I fell and people started to walk over me. I was yelling at them so they could avoid me or help me get up, but nobody could hear me. Finally I woke up because my ribs started to hurt, I could almost feel it in real life.

0.0,8xhxbn,1.0,2.0,"Right, so I had this brilliant dream last night.

To preface, I've been doing a little bit of self help stuff, raising my vibrations changing my paradigm, basic daily routine stuff to increase happiness and overall life gratitude.
I was actually thinking to myself a day before this dream, ""Hm, I haven't had a dream I can remember vividly in a very long time!""
The next night I had this big one:

From where I can remember, I was in a massive super market. The aisles were much wider and the shelves were almost 2 times the size of a tall person. There was this really strange whiteness to it all. I want to say that the floors were white? Or perhaps the lights? Either way, it was a professional looking supermarket.
Stranger still were the people who were all in single file walking up and down the corridors of this supermarket. There were literally thousands of people, on both sides of each aisle, walking up and down. They weren't even buying anything! They were just walking up and down and eventually they'd go into the next aisle.

I believe there was a beginning to this dream but I cannot for the life of me remember what it was. So it was in this supermarket where the dream actually began.

I, who was now in the line of people, asked the person in front of me, ""Who started this?"". The guy in front just shrugs and says,
""I don't know, we've been doing this for ages"".

This is the part where the dream really kicks off.

I reply to the guy and say ""No. One man started this. Only one"".

Suddenly there's this huge noise. Almost like a door opening or something, but it's loud enough to grab everyone's attention. They all stop and look at each other. Everyone looks kind of confused, like this is something that'd never happened before.

I say to the people, ""Wait, stop, everyone look! Everyone at attention!""

Everyone stands up straight and in walks this guy in a suit. In the dream, he was someone I've known ever since I was a kid. Fun fact, him and my brother were born on the same day!

Anyway, he points to me and another guy, who I believe had a place in the beginning of the dream, and says ""You two, come with me.""

At this point there's a bit of a circle around formed around me and the dude and we walk out of it and through the aisles. I'll never forget that as we walking behind this suited man people on the other sides of the aisles were acknowledging that something had happened!

Some were kind of chuckling to themselves and some even were yelling stuff like ""Yeah!"" and ""Wooh!"" almost like celebrating a break in the system! Interesting stuff!

So anyway, we're following this suited man when I whisper to my friend ""We need to get out of here"" and ""We need to find an exit"". Eventually we make it to this door, which on the outside looks like an exit door (green exit sign above it) but in reality was only a door to a concrete room with more doors. Immediately past this door however, there was an emergency exit door and a couple paces into this concrete room me and my friend bolt through it. 

We both run down this sloped decline, there wasn't even stairs it was just something like what you see for wheelchairs. I remember there being more rooms and stairs we ran up and down but I was going so fast that I can't even remember it. But eventually me and my friend made it to this room that I will NEVER forget.

It was huge. I am talking like a giant concrete room with a single staircase on the side of it with a contraption at its peak. At this point there was a single security guard chasing us hot on our tails so me and my friend bolt for the staircase at the end of this room. I make it halfway up this staircase when my friend gets in a scuffle with the goon that was chasing us. At this point he's sort of at the bottom of the stairs holding him off and all he says is ""Go! Just go!""

I waste no time at all, I run up the remaining stairs and reach the contraption. This elevator, if I can even call it that, is the strangest thing, I believe, of the dream.
The elevator itself is just a circular steel grate platform smaller than a sewer hatch door. There's this red button button above it. I press it and I slowly rise up this doorway above. Light pours fourth from it and illuminates the entire concrete room.

Suddenly this girl runs in from where me and my friend did. She starts screaming ""He's only been here 2 weeks?"", ""He's leaving already?!"" and ""Don't go!"". But by this point I am already at the doorway. I take a final little leap from the platform through the door. I made it. I FUCKING MADE IT.

I remember waking up and feeling liberated and free. This dream was probably the greatest dream I have ever had. I feel so excited to be able to tell people about it and instantly told my roommate as soon as I woke up.

Last night I dreamt about an apocalypse happening, but I'm not sure what kind exactly. I remember that people resorted to cannibalism, and I watched one of my coworkers kill his mother, cook her flesh, and eat her in front of a crowd of people. The crowds reaction was negative though, they cringed at it and thought it was disgusting. Not everyone in the apocalypse agreed to resort to cannibalism, but some did. I dont remember my own reaction to watching him do that, but I guess it wasnt negative because I can remember eating a chewy cooked meat that I knew was human flesh. I'm sitting here writing this and I'm just so deeply disturbed and sickened by this. I dont like how well I can remember the taste and consistency in my mouth. 

A few nights before this dream though, I sleep walked. I remember vaguely knowing what time it was (4am) and looking out my bedroom window. When I woke up that morning I felt unusually exhausted like I hadn't slept much at all, despite the fact that I went to bed at a reasonable hour.

0.0,8xa9x0,0.0,2.0,"I was with a group of 3 in snowy tundra. Had a task to take out some enemies at an outpost. No one was there at first. Then I see my teammates start to freak out. I don't see why at first as they are in front of me and seeing around the sides of the structure. First my teammates are wary, then it escalates to a full freak out as the enemies charge up in a large army riding some animals. We apparently pulled up on them during some large scale training exercise and we were right in the middle of it. Bad timing. Our weapons were only good for taking out a focused amount of people. 


We are on high parts of the outpost trying the best we can to use its structure as cover, but the enemies are too much, they are all around us and mass firing arrows. My friends basically decide we are gonna die but we're gonna go out relaying info from the outpost about their training exercise to our side. For a second I accept this plan, then I get hit in the arm by a few arrows and I'm like nah, then I remember I can airbend. So I run & jump off the high outpost while forming a ball of air around me, they all focus on me so I hope I serve as a distraction while my teammates escape. I eventually get to a safe point, well on the other side of the army. My teammates don't have enough time and they end up biting the dust to them soon after. 


So now they were after me, I had to escape that whole place and get somewhere completely different quick. The scale of the world shifted to be more like an overworld in a game, and I quickly flew to a completely different area. I was in this area where there were a lot of brownish stone, tall walls, a mazeish like design and interiors that I never went into.  I thought I would be good there and that I made a good escape, but for whatever reason I was told by the locals that I shouldn't have come here, and I kept getting told that, and I died somehow. (Can't remember how but I think it was the cause of one of the locales that didn't want me there)


Things became even more videogamey as I lost a life and had 2 more. I respawned at the point right before I escaped to a new place away from the tundra. I fly over in the same general landscape again for safety. I was a bit panicked, but also I was hoping it was just that one little area that was weird and I could go somewhere else within that region where I'd be more welcome and hide. Well, everywhere there I went, people were telling me I shouldn't be here, almost as if it were a videogame's way of letting the player know that they shouldn't be in this area yet.


Members of the army start to appear in the area. I swiftly avoid them,  but I know the whole area is becoming increasingly cornered by them. I still believe I can hide out in a more granular location within the area, but then I realize there is no escape from people telling me I shouldn't have come here. So I sort of give that up, and realize it is too late to escape elsewhere. I notice some army people around the corner, and I panic and ""pause the game"". (NOTE: In my dream, I'm not sitting somewhere looking at a screen while playing this. This is entirely first person, I more like “paused my life” but there are clear gamey elements to it)


I think it is a bad decision at first because I thought it would just bring up a menu where my controls are locked to its content, therefore it would just slow me down while the threats continued toward me. I unpause real quick, but then realize that it had actually froze everything in the world. So I pause again, everything freezes, but I had a burning suspicion that I couldn't abuse that for long. I saw the enemies around the corner that were frozen in their tracks. Then I felt a little of my presence as if I were looming in some kind of outside world. As in, outside of the ""game"" trying to turn off the console as my dread about what will happen if I stay paused for too long grew. 


Then in the midst of the still image, I see a figure floating towards me, going around my frozen enemies at ground level. As it quickly approaches, I really panic too much for the outer presence that I felt to find the off switch, so I just close my eyes as it gets close. I hear ""oh ho ho, no can do"" in a deepish almost sounding stereotypical priest-esque voice. I assumed the figure would be some embodiment of the devil before I had even saw it. (Maybe the voice was a bit like a deeper but less grungy version of the small town pizza lawyer from the little ceasar’s commercial, with a little reverb)


So as my eyes are closed, I feel a burning sensation, but more like a high build of anxiety in my stomach as opposed to actual burning. Then I feel/see my life count going down. I'm frozen in anxiety before I realize hey I have time to unpause or turn off the console before he takes my last life. Then I hear ""oh ho ho no no no"" because I took too long to act before he attacked again. -> anxiety build, went down a life. Realize it was one those systems where '0' was your last life. I hear the words again, then I feel everything compressing as the anxiety builds and sustains and I hear a dissonance of high pitched airy screams in the background.


I do think that is the end, but at some point I break out, extremely relieved because I realized I was on the hardest difficulty, which was a difficulty that had some permadeath esque features and was way more punishing. So now I'm on a way more casual difficulty. (Note: these are NOT concrete things I'm seeing or actions I'm doing, it is just what I ""felt I realized"") So I'm walking around again in a snowy tundra free from anxiety, then I hear that voice in the background, coming from the area which he took my lives before. ""Oh ho ho no no no"" Then my anxiety comes back. I thought I was safe, but apparently the game isn't as forgiving as I thought in that instance. I'm like f this and I wake myself up from the dream.


Note: Things happened before the start of this story that I can't remember well. One thing I do remember is my equipment I had to fight in the outpost. Before we realized things weren't according to plan, I had a small but still heavy silver bathtub that I flew around in (though clumsily) similar to how Static Shock rides on the lid of a trash can, and I had a green ray gun lookin thing.",top,"Started off fun, then quickly devolves into inescapable anxiety.",2.0

0.0,8wv0gi,3.0,2.0,"I hope I found the right place to have an appropriate discussion and I diddnt know where else to look. So this dream of mine.. it's not always the same but very similar and it still leaves me with the feeling of anger stemming from the feeling of what I could of done to get a better result. Because of this inability to react to my heart's desire or express myself properly, i feel so trapped and it's very frustrating. Expressing myself properly is something I'm not really good at. Like, whatever happens in my head doesnt come out the way I want it too which is one reason why I like writing instead of vocally communicating. Because when I write, I'm able to accurately describe my feelings and thought process ect. So these dreams usually happen once every 6-8 months so I dont bother but it's happened about 3 times this week. In the most recent dream, I'm around a bunch of friends and in that group is someone I had conflict with. I try to act respectful to everyone even if I have to act as if nothing happened. So I shook hands with everyone but that one person doesnt shake my hands which leaves me feeling angry, and disrespected.  In that dream and in relation to the real conflict, he did whatever he wanted to do to me and I diddnt react how i wanted. I held back.. and lied to myself. So back to reality, Im 21 turning 22 and during my junior year in high school which was about 5 years ago, there was this senior who hung out with my friends and I and we were all juniors. I had class with this person in physical education.. which was a class where we do excersises outside. The class and I were outside early in the morning waiting for the coach to come do attendance. So the senior, me and other classmates I talk to were huddled talking and trying to keep warm. The senior joined in on the conversation and I was looking at him speak and at that moment, he looked at me and said, ""why are you looking at me? You gay or something."" So I said, ""no but those gay jokes are getting old."" Then he said, "" do you want to fight me? You gonna talk to me like that?"" So I told him no I diddnt want to fight him. One classmate was there listening and said to the senior, "" too funny."" Because it was amusing to see this. I then walked away.. and later that day, I told the senior I diddnt want any drama. Which was a lie.. I wanted to hit, scream and fight him til i was satisfied. My adrenaline was pumping and my legs were shaking so bad. He told me he just diddnt like that way I talked to him and that made me so angry because he was the one who started everything first so I should be the one telling him that I diddnt liked the way he talked to me. So what happened from there was that sometime later, the senior told the classmate who was witness to the conflict about me ""conceding"" to him.  The classmate and the senior would laugh and smile at me as if they were looking down upon me for the rest of the year. 
So there's the real conflict .. which to me is an emotional scar.. something I can never really forget. Because of that, I hated myself for my inability for a long time. I dont really know if it was the shame.. anger.. humiliation.. regret that really got to me. Or maybe it was everything? So anyways, this is my own interpretation of my dream and past conflict; if any of you have your own opinions and stories, please share.",top,Can someone help discuss this inconsistent reoccurring dream of mine over a span of 5 years?,2.0

Even though I just graduated high school last month I was back in my least favorite office the AP of history. Though I could see one of my math teachers that I was friends with giving out papers. Once I made it to the front of the mon he forced everyone into a neat and orderly line. I realized I wasnt in line. He told me to get to the back of the line. Although it was so long that it lead out of the school into a foggy cloud. After trying to convince him with civilized conversation and reasonable facts he still kicked me out. I felt really sad and betrayed. Those emotions felt much more powerful than I though they would feel. I started to cry even though I skipped someone two feet outside of the office. A few minutes later while he gave me the paper he said I shouldn't have graduated because the AP of history didnt like me I just brushed him off and left with my paper. [I graduated in the top 2 percent of my highschool class]

<dream changed>

I was in front of a small windowed icecream shop. It started drizzling. I asked him if I could come inside eventually I knew I wasnt going to be allowed to. The conversation turned to just talking so I wouldn't get bored. Slowly he started referring to me in the 3rd person. Someone who he had respect for not just a random student who just graduated. Suddenly he changed from his normally buff self with short blond hair to a skeleton with long black hair. I decided to give him my school email so we can keep in contact for some reason. I finally saw my moms car and started to walk toward it. The last thing I heard him said was ""where did this little paper come from?"" So my mom was taking me to the noodle restaurant that I usually go to with my friends to celebrate my recent graduation.

We were waiting outside the restaurant for the rain to let up so we could leave but we heard a loud noise from the restaurant. The only waitress collapsed and was unconscious. We helped the store owner shift her so she was in a comfortable position. Soon we found a few more people collapsed and unconscious on the street and my mom, the store owner and I helped them all in. At this point I started to feel uneasy. If this was real life I would probably would have been more calm. Now random people came to the restaurant stumbling like zombies begging for help and forgiveness. They brought large cakes and pizzas as of the store was some sort of shrine. Soon they all collapsed but for some reason my mom the store owner and I couldn't pick them up or help them even the tiniest child. I felt so helpless and instead of scared I felt almost surprised. For some reason all these people kept asking for for help but never could interact with us. Eventually the store owner just went to relax and my mom ran out of energy to try help these people.

An officer came in and found the beer and even though I am old enough said it was not allowed but let me go.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I just had a dream about protecting a bunch of children from wolves. I was the only older person and they were all like really rather small children. The dream consisted of the children and I being stuck inside of some kind of a tree stump room / tiny cave made of rock that had a door, a door that was kept closed because there were wolves outside. I’m not sure how I knew, but in the dream I could see visions of the wolves out there and the children were somehow aware of them too. We never actually encountered the wolves at all in the dream and the wolves didn’t really try to get in our room at all, yet we somehow knew they were out there. Also, we knew that when morning came we would have to run out of that forest we were inside of. I think the goal was to run to my house.

&nbsp;

Moreover, I remember me and the kids huddled against a wall of rock inside of that large tree stump room, and they were cuddled with me. We heard and somehow saw the wolves that were outside fighting things and growling. Idk what they were fighting but the point is that they were seen as danger and we could somehow see visions of them even though we were inside of that tree stump room.

&nbsp;

Later on, all of the children besides one are randomly gone and so it’s now just me and this single child in the tree stump room now. This is when we have to get ready to leave. The child didn’t want to and was scared, but I calmed him and told him he would be safe if he followed me out of the forest. It was now  a really foggy morning and before we opened the door, I looked at this random clock that was in the tree stump room that was just on the wall, it was also made of wood like the rest of the room. The clock said that it would take two and a half hours to get this child to my house, and the weird thing is that only a minute beforehand, I told the child myself that it would probably only take 2 and a half hours when I tried to calm him. I told him that night couldn’t happen in that time because it was morning.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I got us ready to leave and then the child was eager to open the door. They opened the door and it revealed an indeed foggy morning and trees around us. The dream ended.

It's weird, it's kind of like a cut scene, but I'll be in another location and I'll be thinking about **Luke** and wanting to go talk to him. **Every time that I have this first dream,** or at least so far,**I walk past his room and see he has a bunch of girls in there**. I get this really overwhelming feeling of jealousy, which is weird because I'm not a normally jealous person, and Luke doesn't hang out with very many girls in real life. He typically surrounds himself with his close guy friends. (Also, not sure if this matters, but I always have my first dream start like this, then I usually wake up in the middle of the night and when I go back to bed the following situation **always** happens).

Usually I wake up after a pretty uneventful dream that consists of me just talking to people and then walking by his room and seeing the girls, then I storm away and wake up. The next part of the dream does vary a bit in the situation we are in, but it's always some sort of life threatening situation. Last night, for example, I don't remember how, but I was talking to one of his friends who I've seen once or twice. I told him how I had feelings for Luke but for some reason he told Luke that I didn't. (This doesn't make sense at all to me but I just have been shrugging it off. This happens every time). Then, somehow, the dream like cuts scenes again and I'm somewhere totally different. Last night in my dream I was in a car with Luke driving, and he was speeding towards a semi truck trying to crash the car because his friend told him I didn't have feelings for him. In the past, instead of him trying to crash the car, he was going to jump off of a cliff and other weird situations. I know that these are dreams, but today for some reason I felt an urge to check on Luke, so I just sent him a snapchat.

Some backstory: My friend Drew, was in a very religious family and his mom kinda screwed him up telling him he'd go to hell for stupid trivial things all the time. We stopped being friends around age 10. He later developed a drug habit as a teenager and when he joined the army he started huffing compressed air because it was the only thing he could get high on that the army couldnt detect on a drug test. After he left the army he was studying chemistry to become a pharmacologist ( i assume so he could made his own drugs) while still being addicted to compressed air. He was found dead in his apartment a couple years ago from huffing. He was always a really smart guy despite his habits. He graduated highschool 2 years early and was a straight A student. He was an army medic as well and his brother says he had PTSD from treating so many soldiers whos limbs had been blown off in road side bombings.

Back to the dream: The fish-man to me seems like a wise trustworthy leader of this group. The group is made up of me and Drew and all these other guys about our age. I think that Drew is very smart and the fish-man could use him for complicated tasks so I go to the ground level of the building to get him. The other guys are more out going jocks and are doing things like building and playing sports. Drew is doing kind of nerdy activity I cant remember exactly. Like math equations or studying biology. I bring him up top to the fish-man but the fish man tells him hes a fool and starts to ridicule him in a cruel way. Im confused at first by this but then think that the fish-man must have some good reason for doing this. He slashes at Drews face as hes saying cruel things to him. Drew stands there blankly accepting it. At some point Drews skin looks like the fish-mans, scaley and grey. He slashes at his neck and rips some of the grey skin away to reveal a pink fleshy layer underneath. Drew' neck starts to erupt an oozy liquid and a ring of 5 eyes with a 6th eye emerge . The fish-man takes the center eye out.

The first of these dreams I remember is running in a snow covered forest. The snow was very deep, and the trees were weighed down in it. It was not snowing at the time, but it was cold. I could un as fast as I wanted- it almost seemed as though I were running on all fours in a way, like an animal perhaps? I was having the time of my life, running without end or exhaustion. At a point, I ran into a boy my age with dark hair and dark, pronounced eyebrows. He seemed familiar but I did not know him. We spoke very briefly, and he began to leave. I cried out for him to stay, feeling so comfortable and whole with him. He said we'd meet again.   


The next of these I was on a steep, enormous hillside, like at the foothills of a mountain range. It was warm and misty, and the hillside was filled with long grass and thousands of wildflowers. At the bottom of the hillside was a shallow river fjord, and a foot bridge. Just beyond it was what appeared to be a small town. Again, I could run as fast and far as I pleased,and I felt the water under my feet as I fjorded the river, and the grass as I tore up the hillside. Again, this male figure with dark hair and dark brows came to me, but in the distance. I rememebred his words that we'd meet again, but my dream didn't let me speak.   


The last one I remember, and the most recent, I think I was running through some sort of terrain that varied from deep, lush, mossy forests to craggy cliff sides by the ocean. I felt the soft earth and the clear air. I ran through so many different biomes ranging from the shoreline to the mountain woodlands, all lush and green and warm. This time, the man was there with me, as a guide almost. He was always just ahead or just behind me, out of reach. He spoke, but it seemed like regular dream talk. I remember the least about this dream, but he seemed a bit different (other than the fact hat he had aged again as I do in each new dream, considering they're so far apart.)

Secondly, I can’t have biological kids but this has never bothered me because I haven’t particularly thought about wanting them before. 

———————-

So, this dream always starts in my house and my family is all here and so is me and my ‘husband’ who isn’t my boyfriend. The only way I can describe him like is a huge (probably like 8’0”) blue/grey guy with devil horns  . 
In my dream I know this is someone completely different to my current boyfriend but I always forget he exists in the dream so it doesn’t bother me. 

We have a son together (I just know he was biological in the dream) and it’s all cutesy cutesy happy family stuff with us and the kid. 

Then the fbi show up. 

This is the recurring theme. I always have dreams about something evil showing up at my house and having to run out to the woods a few miles from my house to escape it (it never works). The weird thing is these woods don’t exist and neither does the surrounding area of my house but somehow it always is the exact same. 

So as usual, I am the only person panicking and packing a survival bag while everyone else doesn’t seem to care until they start trying to block off all the exits. 

Long story short we all run but as we are running through the fields we realise (they just appear but my brain felt like they were there before) big sirens blaring and flashing lights and fences because they’re doing a military test which ends up just making a massive pylon fall over (another staple to my bad dreams). 

A woman with us separates the fence so that people can crawl through away from harm and I get through but as I go to pull my son through from the ‘husband’, the person stops holding the fence. 

I’m trying to pull this kid through and he’s getting all cut and caught on the fence but I do manage on my own (for some reason, I knew in the dream that the husband couldn’t help so I’m not annoyed at him because he is also getting really upset).

I try to get the husband through because he is so tall that he could just step over it but he refuses and when the thing falls, he is centimetres away from being killed. 

When I run over and am trying to hold him etc. in relief, i feel myself me shot and I wake up. 

In other dreams of the same theme, if we ever make it to the woods, there’s always something evil waiting.

I’m in a gray cotton peacoat, helmet and boots. During the lucid moments I typically putz around inside the emplacement for a bit, but there’s not much going on. I can hear waves but other than that there’s nothing, no planes, no explosions, nothing. I look through the firing slats and I start to see troops landing on the beaches, just a few at first and for some reason I’m desperate to dispatch them. I’ve figured out the rifle I’m using is an M1 Garand (I’ve seen them in media and used in games so I recognized it) Another boat or two land but the beach is far enough down that I have some time to deal with them, always with the same fear and desperation. Soon, more and more boats start coming and I can barely tell if I’m firing or reloading at that point, the troops start getting closer and eventually she (mother) always turns up, I don’t know how I know but I can always suddenly tell that she’s there, marching towards me but I can’t get rid of her no matter what and I always wake up right as I look her in the eyes as she reaches the bunker.

I rarely dream and if I do I rarely remember anything except bits and pieces. Last night I had a super realistic vivid dream and I cannot stop thinking about it. I couldn't sleep after waking from it.

I was meeting 3 of my high school girl friends at a house that one of them suggested we meet at. I was then on a mission trying to get to this house to hang out where I ended up on a woodsy cliff. I managed to wrap razor wire around my arm and 'ride' down the cliff. When I got to the party one arm was scratched and bleeding from the razor wire and the other arm was scratched and bleeding from the branches/thorns. I kept looking at my bleeding arms throughout this dream.

So I get to this house, my 3 friends are there. There is a older blading heavier set man wearing a white tank and has scars around his one eye and cheek that doesn't talk and I don't recognize. I feel like it was his place though. I am thinking total creep he's going to kill us vibe.

I start hanging with my friends and we decide to go across the street for something bar, casino, can't remember. I get my in my car with a passenger and I make a wrong turn out of this parking lot down a huge hill and it's covered with snow. I manage to turn around and get us back up the hill.

I go back inside and everyone says how they were surprised I made it up the snow covered hill. We drink play cards and I say at 10pm I'm going to head to bed. I remember thinking, hey that creep hasn't kills anyone yet and falling asleep.

I wake up and the rooms of this house seem more grungy than the day before. I go room to room and find the scar creeper cleaning scalpel blades at a sink. I go back into a room and find everyone sitting on the floor cross-legged, the scar guy comes in and slices each person's cheek from the bottom up so it looks like a flap of bloody skin just hanging, yet these people are all smiling. I run and find my mom holding my son and say go before he comes, he's skinning everyone. My mom goes behind a curtain that was up and sets down my son and leaves as I say NOO take him with you.

i looked up at the top of the hedge and saw a goat with glowing red eyes looking down, directly at me. as soon as i saw it, it fell off of the hedge and landed behind me but it got stuck between the hedges. i freaked out and pushed my friends out of the hedges and we walked into a dirt path with bushes and dead trees on either side of it. we started walking along the path until a hole opened up in the ground and swallowed one of my friends. another one got snatched by some vines i think, and i dont remember what happened to the third.

by this point i was by myself and had made it to the end of a path. there was a wall to my right and a troll/ goblin looking thing in front of me. it scared me, so i ran towards the wall and started climbing up it. he started chasing me up the wall, and i almost made it to the top, before fell off and into a tub of acid that was connected to the side of the wall before i could make it. i could feel my skin disintegrating, but it wasn't painful.

the goblin made it to me, and grabbed a fork and knife and started eating me. before he could actually get anywhere with me aside from like 1 bite, i either fell or was launched out of the tub onto a large circular wooden platform with a bunch of jackolanterns surrounding me me. i looked in front of me and there was a with a suit a pumpkin head. he pressed this big red button next to him and i was catapulted into the air, through the sky, and into my room and bed where i woke up.

So here’s the dream:

I’m not sure of the exact events leading up to this situation, but my car broke down or something. 
I went to this store and all the employees were really helpful and the manager was super nice and was going to take me the rest of the way to my aunt’s house. 


So we get into his car and there’s no creepy vibe or anything, I’m usually really good at reading a person’s character. We had normal conversation and he seemed like a nice, professional guy but as he’s driving along after a while some exchange was made and he said something along the lines of, you’re very observant, and I said yes like we’re going the wrong direction (I didn’t know if we were, and I hoped not, but I wanted to seem like I knew what was going on) so he said, yes you’re right. 


So at this point I know I’m being abducted and we’re on this back, dirt road in the middle of this big field of rolling hills but there is a road nearby which makes me feel a little better. So I decide to stay calm and go along with it, instead of fight cuz then maybe I can get out of it without him killing me. At this point I’m expecting him to rape and kill me. 


So we get to this old abandoned house and we don’t go inside but he’s being very forceful pulling me out of the car and trying to take my clothes off. And I keep thinking that if I scream and fight he’s going to kill me, and that I need to figure out how to be in charge of this situation. 


So I pretend that I’m into it so he stops being so aggressive and I’m saying things like, I’m glad he’s the one who brought me instead of someone else, to lower his guard and hopefully the chance that he’ll kill me. 


So he ends up putting it in and I keep thinking that I can’t be submissive, I need to be in control, so I flip him over and sit on top of him and try to act sexy like I wanted this to happen, all the while feeling grossed out.


At this point he does let up on being aggressive, and he is acting like he believes that I’m into it. It grosses me out that I’m seemingly just having sex with this guy. I start talking like, so will I get to see you next weekend when I come back from my aunts? Trying to get a read on if he’s still going to kill me. 


You can tell he’s confused because he wasn’t planning on it going like this, I could tell he wants to believe me, but his face switches back to being aggressive. 


So I really start pushing it, talking about what a great time I had, wondering if I could get his number, rubbing my hand on his arms (it grosses me out I acted like this). 


Then someone shows up in a car, they had seen us, and thought we were broken down and came over to see if we needed help. I was so relieved that this was my chance to get out, but he said, no we’re fine. 

I didn’t know if I should continue faking it, or tell the person I was abducted. I didn’t know what this guy had on him to kill me with and also my car was back at his shop and he knew my aunts address.... so if I freaked out and fled he could hunt me down and kill me eventually even if I did get away right now. 

So I continued to go along with it to make him feel like I was on his side, saying sorry to the person and that we were fine. Hoping he believed we had our fun and he’d bring me to my aunts. 


But then I woke up. I don’t know if I ever got out of the situation, if my plan worked, or if he eventually killed me. 

I think it’s weird that I dreamt that, but more importantly I think it’s really weird how I handled it- it creeps me out that I went along with it... but it makes sense.

  ---
1. The one that started it all. Mildy creepy. It starts in a Football stadium. The match is about to start. The crowd is cheering. But suddenly several monstrous-looking people erupt from the ground. They have a purple-ish tint all over their bodies. They lunge at the people wildly. Then it cuts to me. I stand in a parking zone, and these creatures appear from the corner of the building. I run away, not knowing where to go. I enter a weird building with big metal doors. I meet no one there. And then I see the monsters tearing the metal door apart. I quickly traveled up the stairs to the second floor. The interior of this floor was almost identical to that of my real room. I wait there for what seems like several minutes. And then I hear the fron door of the floor opening. I hide under the bed. The creature walks in, it knows that I am here, and I know that it knows that. So, just before it comes up to my bed and grabs me, I rush at the corridor that leads to this room. The creatures lunges at me, but misses. I run into the room, but do not know what to do and where to hide. This is where it ends and I wake up.

  ---
2. A pretty unnerving and sad dream, as I love my Grandapa. The dream is set in the backyard. Me and my Grandpa sit on a bench. Out of nowhere several creatures appear. They REALLY resembled headcrabs. The leap all over the backyard, and I find a knife and a pistol lying nearby. I shoot and slash some of them, but one manages to land on the head of my Grandpa, who just sat there with no emotion. And suddenly some unknown person comes and pushes my Grandpa off the bench. This is where the story ends.

   ---
3. Probably the longest dream I ever had. Honestly, pretty scary because of how impressed by the quality of it I am. It starts when I wake up in a house that is not currently mine, but looks somewhat similar to the house, where I spent my childhood. When I wake up, a woman meets me. She resembles my Mother, but very loosely. The woman says something to me, and we leave the house, which was pretty much in ruins. She drives a car parked near the house. She drives, and I see the street and the City Block, where I lived as a child, only destroyed. I saw countless cars that were blown up, their parts scattered across the ground. Suddenly, she told me that Aliens Invaded Earth, and almost everyone is dead. We stopped driving after like 5 minutes. She pulled a Notebook out of the car. She showed me that despite the condition of the world, the Interenet still exists. Then, I do not remember many detaills. I realized that the car was a transformer, when it turned into a 10 meter tall robot. Then we went to another building. There we found what looked like a fresh plate of salad. The woman tried to get it, but I angerly told her not to do so. I said that it was very strange for food to just be there, when there are almost no people left in the world. She agreed with me for the most part. But then another, more bio-mechanical transformer busted the wall and tried to kill us. Our transformer said that it was one of the sentries Aliens use to find and kill humans. He then became a car, and we drove away, and the Alien transformer probably left us alone. Then we arrived at the base of the Aliens. Hunderds of them met us. They greatly resembled Mi-Go from the Cthulhu Mythos. Then our transformer tried to rush at the central device of the base and break it, but he was hit by something and then I felt things from his point of view, it was friggin weird. He felt immense pain, and began to vaporize, but at the last second of his life, he showed my a thumbs up. The woman was nowhere to be seen. And the last minutes of this dream I do not fully remember. I only remember that they did something to me, so I stayed still and did not ty to escape. The told me that they come from another galaxy and visisted the planet because they saw potential in us. But after arriving near the planet, they understood that humans are a little miserable and their emotions get in the way of true harmony, or something like that. Then they explained tbat they concieved a clever plan. They needed to abduct all of the human pouplation. They stored the bodies in tanks filled with a certain liquid. They told me that when they store all humans, they will make us much stronger, granting nigh-omnipotence. They thought that by making our bodies stronger, all of the conflicts and bad sides of the human nature would be gone. They needed all of the humans to be there, mostly because it would be not fair, if some humans became much more powerful than the others. After the speech, the process began. I was placed in this tank. And it felt like something was going on inside my body. Then all of the tanks were opened. I saw billions of people hovering all over the room, not knowing what to do. And then the creatures asked us to thank them. But then I experienced something terrible, as I learned that the Apocalypse lasted nearly 10 years, and that the methods of the Aliens were not the kindest. I quickly killed all of the Aliens in the base by making them painfully vanish, I heard their pathetic screams. Then I destroyed the whole base. Only the landscapes of the ruined city were before me and billions of other demigods. 


  ---
These dreams scare me a little because of two things. 

First, their main theme is always Apocalypse. In all dreams different creatures invade my city, or even the whole planet.

Second, I had a nightmare each night in a row. I had a nightmare only once in my life, and it was like 3 years ago. This just sems like a strange coincidence.

I was talking to a person, not really saying anything though. then the perspective shifted, And I could see myself.  It zoomed in on my face.  I wasn't wearing glasses, and my right eye had changed color to white.  


That was a few days ago. Then last night i dreamed about my eye again.  It was the same thing,  I was chatting with an unidentified person again.  This time I couldn't see myself.  I noticed that my vision was out of focus.  I couldn't see in one eye.  I can't remember if it was that I couldn't open one eye or couldn't see in one eye.

 In the dream i'm playing rugby and I get passed the ball, I look to my right as I start running towards the try-line and immediately I see there are 2 people chasing me.
 I know these people from my past(high school). its a male and female both next to each other chasing me. I think to myself I will stop them by using my palm to ""palm"" them away...it works, they keep chasing me but the whole time I am moving faster and further away then they can chase me. Effectively being able to outrun them. That's all that happened.
 I don't remember hearing any sounds or any more people

Background info:

The female was about the same age as me. We were friends, she went to my school, we talked a bit, I had a crush on her cause she was beautiful. However, I let go of that and decided I didn't want her. She only had a very tiny impact on my life if any.

The male was about the same age as me. Went to my school, we spoke sometimes, I had nothing against him. He had no impact on my life at all.

 In my waking life I don't have many relationships at all (I just don't). I don't run away from new relationships in fact I welcome them. Maybe the dream has something to do with my current relationships...i don't know. I also haven't seen these people in a few years. Sometimes I have dreams of people from my past but they are not usually ""chase/running/stopping me from achieving my goal"" dreams.

 I will refrain from adding my own interpretation as to not skew peoples interpretations. I am in my early 20's if that helps.

Has anyone had any dreams like this and figured them out? Your experience would be helpful as well as your thoughts and interpretations on what this all means, thanks

Somehow the topic changes to where one friend is explaining how cows experience things exactly like we do, and everything else does, and if we truly understood that, we wouldn't eat them or harm anything for that matter. I'm shown a video on the phone of a scared baby cow in a factory farm, or the image pops up in my head. The calf is just looking around like holy shit wtf is all of this, this is fucked. I could actually feel that feeling and I am taking in his/her awareness, I actually experience my mind merging with the calf. Suddenly everything clicks really fast. I somehow embody that feeling of the calf for a moment, and then my head bursts with energy, it was so strong. I was then just on the couch kind of unable to move much but moving my arms a bit to let them know something was not feeling right.

At this point I wonder if they think I'm having a seizure or something, but it's just my head having this intense feeling that I have never felt before.

Context:

I seem to be exploring some alien planet and am in a laboratory in a basement with a square tile floor. The captain of the expedition, an elderly man tries to lead me up a ladder leading up a small tunnel like corridor in order to get to the spaceship outside the room and escape the planet. As he's climbing up 2 hideous anthropomorphic cockroach like humanoids come down the ladder leaving a trail of slime in their wake.  
We both fear that the expedition has failed. There are windows that lead to the outside, and just as hope is lost we see the ship taking off. I remember a third and final member of the expedition, a mustachioed man around the age of 27\-35 that was able to get to the spaceship and take off.

The cockroach species are furious and try to blast him out of the sky to no avail, he escapes unscathed and me and my captain are left with a vague sense of hope and fear that he will either come back for us, or simply leave with us in his wake.

I've explored some of the symbolism.. IE, I think the captain represents an old wise man, and myself my own conscious ego. The humanoid cockroaches are some aspect of my shadow I don't understand.. The ladder/staircase is very common in my dreams and I'm finding going up the ladder has been prevalent for 3 dreams in a row. I don't know what the wild rogue like man represents..

Last night \( 6/2/18 \) I had these awful back to back nightmares where my partner \( a man \) was cheating on me with different women. But thats not the strange part, the strange part was that I was looking for him in this long and dark hallway, I was scared and looking and as I was walking down this hallway doors lined both sides of the wall so I opened them to find him, and in each room he was doing some other woman and I would cry and scream at him to stop, then after he was finished, shut the door and move on like nothing happened only to open the next door to see him with a different woman doing the same thing. I t was like I didn't remember he was cheating after I shut one door, moving onto the next.

Finally, I reached the end of this hallway, there was one door, a maroon colored door, I opened it and found my bed, it was empty and the room was dark. As I climbed into my bed, all the memories of him cheating on me with those women flashed back in a rush and I cried myself to sleep. But the nightmare doesn't end there.

I woke up in my dream bed, and my boyfriend was climbing through my window with a garbage bag. He slinked over to me and injected me with something, I don't know it made me so numb and I couldn't move or talk, I was just staring at him helplessly. He had cut me up, into pieces, I had my torso, two arms, two thighs, tow legs with feet attached, and my head. Then he put each piece into the bag and it went dark. Finally, I awoke in a dark room, laid out on the table, still in pieces. The table felt cold and solid, like it was a rock? but it was flat. Anyways, I start hearing a voice, I don't know this voice but it was taunting me and thats when I woke up for real.

In the first, I was pulled over in an extremely busy road. As in there was nowhere to pull over and I just ended up stopping and the cop pulled up next to me. He asked if I knew why he pulled me over and I said “No, sir.” And he said “Well there’s a conspiracy that someone has tricked you into committing a crime.” (Which to my knowledge no one has, as I’ve never done anything worthy of being arrested or even questioned.)

In the second one I was at my old house and my mom and I were fighting and I ended up going to the basement to look for something and once I found it I started going upstairs, but no matter what switch I flipped, the lights wouldn’t go out. So I gave up and they went out behind me and there was a growling. (As I was waking up at there was this sickly green light and a voice was whispering “You should kill yourself, you should honestly just kill yourself.” Not going to.)

In the third one, my manager told me she needed me at work immediately. I headed over, and I was freaking out because I hadn’t had a chance to do laundry or cut my nails or shave. And by the time I got there she was in her car smoking and she said “We don’t need you to work today.”

In the fourth one I was at my grandma’s house. Most of it takes place in the garage or the front yard. My best friend that I recently had a fight with (who hasn’t been speaking to me) was there unpacking a van with his girlfriend or sister or whoever. He never spoke to me in the dream, but I went to help them unpack it and the girl was like “Yeah, thanks, but we really DO NOT need YOUR help.” Then it sort of fast towards to a part where they leave for the day. I was crying in the garage because he won’t talk to me and my grandma asked what was wrong and I basically yelled at her that it wasn’t her business and we fought about it. Then it fast forwarded again to a part where I was walking in a city and he and the girl were behind me talking about me like I couldn’t hear them.

The fifth one, I was at some kind of university and I snuck into a fraternity that apparently hadn’t been updated since the 80’s. All of the furniture and paint were ugly patterns or neon. I went through the commons into this hallway with a row of doors. I kept opening the multicolored doors to find individual showers painted a deep green until I came to a pale blue door that was already open. It was wet and the details in the door were filled with dead ladybugs. I pushed it open and the stale water and ladybugs sloshed on the floor and opened up to a hallway instead of a shower. There were communal showers and a gym at the end but I didn’t check it out since there were guys in there and I broke in after all. I found some friends in another room I was allowed to be in and told them I found a way to break into one of the frats.

The dream started out like so, I hopped onto my bus to take me to school (as I usually got a bus to school back then) and noticed the driver was a man I had not encountered driving the bus before. He was large and rather fat with and oversized trench coat with an unkempt black beard and scabbed face.

I took my seat and then suddenly noticed (as you do in dreams since details seem rather foggy until later as the dream plays out) that the bus was filled with my classmates and many that usually don't get the bus. We all looked at each other as if we had just noticed each other, but before we had a chance to talk we heard an unearthly scream from the driver and the bus gained speed next thing we knew, the bus flew straight off a cliff, but did not fall, in fact, it flew through the air and sped up quickly, it was so fast we were all unable to even move. the scenery faded into a a distorted sky filled with colours of orange, purple and white which seemed to alternate randomly.

We reached the destination. We were in what appeared to be a nexus or pocket-universe outside our own. We landed on a flaoting island in the nexus. A rather large island, that seemed to be made up of warm, orange, dehydrated soil. The sky remained a mixture of the usual orange, purple and white colours.

We were forced out of the bus by the driver. What awaited on the island was a large plantation which, if I remember, was solely a potato farm. The island was nothing but large potato crops spread throughout the island with a large tower at the end. The driver appeared to be the main overseer of the plantation. He called upon what I assumed were his henchmen who seemed to be guards.

Surprisingly, I even remember the driver/overseer's name. If I remember correctly, his name was Broodsnan, yes I know it sounds pretty silly.

We were all put to work on this plantation, day-in and day-out we were digging up potatoes and planting new ones in blazing hot heats ,despite this nexus appearing to not have a sun. The nexus itself appeared to produce it's own heat somehow.

It came a day when we decided to hatch an escape plan. The only way we knew out of here for sure was the bus that brought us there. Me and someone else broke into the large tower at the far end of the island I mentioned before, during the night. We found Brooodsnan's room, who was fast alseep and stole the keys for the bus.

We made it half way to the bus, were everyone else waited for us and were ready to leave, until we heard a large angry roar behind us from far off in the tower, which of course was Broodsnan. He was running towards us from the tower at rediculous speeds.

We made it too the bus and I handed the keys to another friend of mine who was driving us out of there. Broodsnan was quickly catching up as the entire island was shaking with his thunderous running. We got the bus started and managed to get out of there unharmed. That was pretty much the end of the dream.

So, as I said, the unusually amount of detail and clarity to this dream is the reason it has stuck with me. I haven't had a dream since that has been as clear and defined as this.

Could anyone tell me if there is possibly any type of interpretations to this dream and it's content? Particularly the other world and the Broodsnan character.

Kinda just wanted to put this somewhere where people wouldn’t call me crazy lol . 

So I normally don’t dream , idk why , I had a bunch of really intense nightmares when I was a teenager that would keep me up for literally days and days , and then all of a sudden I just stopped . 

Now I only dream when there’s a message in it , if that makes sense ? I had weird dreams before my parents split up , right before the election, before my brother announced he was enlisting , before my co worker was in a really bad car wreck , I dreamed about several partners before I met them etc etc . It’s weird . I always have this moment where something happens and I’m like “ man , that’s where that dream came from .” 

Every so often I have this really weird , really vivid dream . It’s the same people in the same setting, almost like another life but it always ends the same , the same things happen . I don’t know how to stress how real it feels . 

It takes place over I would guess 2.5 or 3 years . In the dream I have kids , the youngest is 2, and I’m pregnant with her when everything starts but just starting to show . 
 I’m always living with this man that I don’t know in real life and we’re very happily married with three kids. There’s been some sort of national change like a war , or a depression , something like that , and us , my mother and a man she’s happy with that ive never seen , my brother and a woman he’s happy with that I’ve never seen , and some friends I’ve never seen are all living on this property I own in real life . There’s the main house - which burnt down at the beginning of the year in real life - and  For some reason I have the properties on either side of us , where the rest of them have dispersed. It’s like a commune type deal over about 4 acres. For some reason , there’s something about my myself , husband , and kids that is this HUGE secret . I’m not really sure what it is , but it’s a big enough deal to scare me , which is hard to do . We aren’t really in hiding or anything, but there are several instances where we have to tell our kids not to say things in public that would give us away , or where my husband and I talk about how hard it is living this way.  My brother comes home one day , and tells me there’s some weird stuff going on in main town , some people are talking , and to hang out at the house for the day instead of going out with his girlfriend and another friend of ours to talk to the farm up the road about a trade . (It’s a pretty rural community and this isn’t really out of the norm , even in real life. It’s very much like a ive got peppers you’ve got eggs community .). I’m like cool, cuz I trust him and if he says there’s some weird stuff going down , it’s best for me and my kids to stay home and on the safe side . I’m taking care of some house things and my mom comes in with a bunch of stuff from the garden and tells me there’s something wrong with one of the plants , could I go look at it . Sure no problem , let me take the kids with me , this is a great teaching moment . I go out and these authoritative type people are out there that SCARE . ME . SILLY . Like I have this feeling of utter and total fear and betrayal , because whatever the secret is , obviously my mom and brother have ratted us out . Some graphic stuff happens that I’ll leave out , and they end up burning my husband , my three kids ( LITTLE kids , like 2,5,and 7) and me alive at the stake , Salem style , and the whole family just watches . My mom and brother are like stone faced , and everyone else is like there’s nothing we can do to help you now . The douches killing us are like you knew better and you did it anyway , this could have all been avoided . No one ever actually says what it is that we did , but in the dream I have this feeling like how long did I think I could we could do this . 

It’s the same every time , but last night it changed and I can’t figure out why . 

The first change was my aunt and uncle came to stay with us . My husband comes in and tells me he thinks he should move them in , cuz the area they’re in has been getting worse . Another one of my aunts also comes to visit us, and she even says it’s been a long time since she saw us . It doesn’t seem like she knows my youngest kid , and the other two don’t respond to her the way they do other family and friends  that they see all the time . 
 The second change comes when I go outside and see my kids playing , the same as always , but this time there’s this weird sound we all hear , like a tornado siren , and it makes them laugh ? Like we all think it’s hilarious , and the oldest tells my brother “ I remember when I used to be scared of that” .
The next change comes when my brother tells me not to go out . This time my aunts tell me that I should be careful , because they have a bad feeling about today . My husband walks in and we talk about moving to Louisiana ( I’ve been in love with Louisiana since I was a kid in real life ) , and he tells me he got some land down there and he’s gonna go finalize everything next week . We seem really excited about it , like it’s gonna be a really great opportunity for us . We talk about getting everything packed , how we’re gonna facilitate the move , if we’re gonna try to take any of the plants or just leave them , logistic stuff . We’re both acting like getting out of the area is gonna be a relief to us . While we’re having this conversation , my two front crowns fall out of my mouth into my hand  , and I get this feeling of dread , like it was a sign of something bad . I put them back in ( cuz apparently I’m good like that ) and go about my day , but the feeling never really goes away . I kinda feel like I’m looking over my shoulder . 

Everything else plays out exactly the same , except this time I woke up before we got burned . 

I don’t know why I’ve had this dream so vividly so many times , and I don’t know why it’s been exactly the same until now . I started having it about three years ago , but I’ve had it more and more frequently the last three months or so . It’s so vivid that I wake up in tears genuinely confused about where I am and where my kids are . I can’t think of anything I could do that would prompt my brother to snitch on me to that degree , or what could be going on that people would be hunting kids that small .

0.0,8mkiix,10.0,2.0,"Can someone familiar with dream interpretation take a stab at this weird dream I had last week? 
Here is some background:

I had a baby Thursday and then I had this dream Thursday night. This baby is my fourth child, and my home life is...questionable in its stability. To say the least.  

Okay so here is the dream:

I was at a nighttime party, seemed tropical in nature.  Like some kind of an open cabin or bungalow strung with little Christmas lights and Caribbean music playing, and the mood was relaxed and comfortable.  Several areas leading to the outdoors, and a lot of people I knew from high school standing around socializing in little clusters. 

I don’t know if I was looking for my husband at the moment or had been looking for him prior to that, but at some point I had called his cell phone and he had not answered. I had just had a baby (in the dream as well as real life) but was walking around as though everything was normal. I had an open bathrobe on, and I was completely naked underneath it, full frontal nudity. I didn’t seem to mind much though. In fact, I think I remember being satisfied with my body, if not slightly aware that I was the only naked person around.

 I went to the bathroom and when I went to wash my hands, I realized they hurt. I looked down and they had become degloved. The last three fingers on my left hand were also badly mangled. I pulled the skin down and stretched it back over the bones on both hands the best I could and started trying to find my husband to help me. 

I called him again and he didn’t answer. 

I found some sort of intercom device and this guy I knew from high school’s voice came over it (he was a friend of my high school bf) and he offers to page my husband to the room we’d been staying in, so I said “thank you, that would be great.”


The same guy’s voice then came over a loudspeaker and the party stopped briefly while he made the announcement that my husband needed to meet his “wonderful wife up in their room!” and then he cheerfully signed off, DJ style, and the music resumed playing.

 I headed toward the room my husband and I had been sharing and on my way I ran into my aforementioned highschool boyfriend, who is now a neurologist, and for some reason I kept my hands hidden behind my back...despite the fact this guy is not only a doctor but has always been kind, supportive, and caring toward me.

(My husband is a contractor by trade, which makes it even more confusing that I was seeking his help in the dream while hiding my injuries from a doctor, who was conveniently right in front of me?)

 The ex bf seemed possibly interested, concerned that I found my husband and was asking how I was doing but did not ask about or seem to notice my hands hidden behind my back while we were talking.

Finally I make my way to the room, except it was more like an old coffee shop inside a mall with a little bed and breakfast nook at the top and there was an older, refined albeit slightly creepy gentleman in there (reminded me of an English butler or the man-servant from The Rocky Horror Picture Show) greeting me who had made some fancy cappuccino for us when he heard the overhead announcement.

However, once I got there I realized that even though we had stayed there for several nights, this was NOT the last place we had stayed. The last place we had stayed was the night before in some sleazy roach motel, so I became increasingly concerned that my husband would not know where to meet me.

However he showed up a few minutes later and asked me what was wrong. He was annoyed with me and had no explanation for not answering his phone. 

But before I could find out why he hadn’t been available or if he if was going to help me, I was awakened in real life by a doctor checking in on me so I never really figured out where that dream was going (or if there was any significance to it at all.)",top,Mangled and degloved hands,2.0

This week I have started to have dreams about my ex (30/F). We broke up 6 months ago. I admittedly am not over her. We haven't spoken since we broke up. I've seen her in passing 3 times now since we broke up. Leading up to seeing her, I have multiple nights of dreams about her.

My dreams don't ever seem to have much (if any) actual conversations. Just kind of floating through them. 

Monday: The dream was like we were still together. Enjoying ourselves at a house that felt like it was ""ours"". Her son was there and we were all hanging out as a family. Nothing really was happening. We were laughing and doing just normal things we had done in the past.

Tuesday: I finally decided to block her phone number in case she ever did reach out to me. The dream I had that night was us going to the park to bike ride. One of the activities we both really enjoyed doing together. 

Wednesday: The dream was about just her and I having a lazy weekend day in that house from Monday's dream. The house and the furniture, decorations, ect were extremely vivid. There were things like pictures of us places that weren't familiar at all. Like we went on vacations together. 

Thursday: I saw her pulling out of a parking garage. We made eye contact and she drove away. Didn't dream about her last night.

Has anyone had strange occurrences like this? This is the third time this has happened. Multiple nights of dreams about her in a row and then she is there in real life. I don't dream about her expect for when this happens. 

Does it all boil down to me not being over her? Me longing for the past? Me longing for a future that doesn't exist anymore?

tl;dr Having multiple consecutive nights of happy dreams about an ex that aren't really vivid (or I just can't remember all of the details) then end up running into her at random places.

In recent events, I am moving to a new city and received a new opportunity there. I will be subleasing a place temporarily and have everything set up.  I am in a relationship and it has had it's rocky moments but we are doing a lot better now.  Now to the dream......In this dream I am back where I used to live \( California\) with some old roommates. We are all having a hard time finding an affordable place and decide to get a place together \( we aren't too happy about this\) but the place is big and affordable. I look around and go to the office which is an old home of some family friends. My sister and I grew up with their kids. We are walking around a pool talking about everything all of us has been up to as well as how his kids are \( they aren't there\) just him and his wife. The pool is large and pretty clear. They tell me to take a swim \( since I am in awe\) and seem to be in a bathing suite attire \( cant really remember what I wore\). I jump in and next thing I know I continue to float down and it takes a while since it is a really deep pool. I get to the bottom and look up and slightly panic as I feel I wont make it back to the surface on time and will drown, but then kind of feel at peace and accept my fate but then I tell myself, this is a dream, wake up!

0.0,8kmpxl,0.0,2.0,"This dream was quite all over the place, and it felt like some type of message. It started out with my family moving in to a new house, which resembled our current home, or at least my room did. It struck me as odd that my new room still had the possessions of the previous owners in it (candles, books, furniture, etc.). When I visited it for the first time, I felt very tired, sick, nauseous, hot, and markedly short of breath. I just assumed that those feelings of not-rightness were tied to my fear of change/ the move that was real in the dream. However, my parents had an encounter with a ghost in my room (a ghost of a woman who murdered her husband and then committed suicide in the room), so that explained why I felt uneasy and unable to sleep in there as the days passed. I remember feeling visceral fear upon learning this; although I’ve always wanted to see a ghost & have had a lifelong fascination with the paranormal, I felt sheer terror and felt like I was violated. I was worried that the entity would harm my puppy or my family or me, since it was one who died violently. Some more sleepless nights go by & my parents continue to express dismay over this. Even the physical lighting in the dream is dark.

The next event is that my mom tells me I have a visitor outside on the front porch. I’m greeted by a woman with her back turned to me, whom I’d felt like I had seen in my dreams before. I feel a rush of comfort and love for her- hope. I remember the way our interactions go; I’m not supposed to look at her face, and she must keep her back turned from others so that they do not see her (I did happen to look at her though, and she’s an absolutely beautiful woman with flowing long gray hair wearing a white dress with delicate pink flowers and long black coat). She asks me quite simply, “What’s going on in your heart, (my name)?” I felt as though she asked because she knew, as I knew, that something inside of me was making the ghost manifest in my space. I ended up being interrupted, as she was talking with my siblings or friends for some time. I was left to ponder her question, and the answer became evident in even the experience of how I felt during the interruptions: jealous, excluded, unable to interject myself into the conversation and participate. Eventually she led me away, on a short walk where I told her my answer to her question; I told her that I was feeling very disconnected, longing for intimacy with people but still unsure of how to connect with people, even after 23 years of life (only have 2 friends, never dated, etc.). She listened to my answer but did not respond to it with sympathy or guidance. She simply communicated to me that she was called to contact me by the church, because I needed to know that my disconnection had been felt and that God did have a home & work for me in this world (I left church 5 years ago and have no intentions of going back, as I am not religious). She vanished, and I was left to ponder her message and my self-realizations that she revealed (I’m profoundly disconnected right now, hauntingly so, and this is something that doesn’t just affect me, hence why I was scared for my puppies, as well as my family).I feel like I understand this part of the dream; those messages are pretty self-evident. It’s the next part that I don’t understand. I could be wrong, but I feel like this next part was connected to that same dream.

I decided to take a day trip into a city to do some self-reflection and get away from home. I pretty much just walked a lot and distantly, half-heartedly observed the world there. I ran into trouble when my phone was about to die & I needed it to find my way back to the train. I stopped by an outdoor market booth to ask a woman for a charger (she tried selling me things, I felt bad about being too poor to help her, and she didn’t have a charger). This is when I ran into a beautiful woman on the street, whom I recognized from somewhere (not real life- I think it was another dream). I think I’m straight in real life, but I often dream that I’m a lesbian. She picked me up & spun me around, ecstatic to see me (and I to see her). We walked around for a while with our arms around each other, kissing & some other playful stuff, and then we found a place where I could charge my phone. We hit up a concert afterwards, in a super distorted version of a place I used to work. It was a great show, and I was sad to leave. A weird thing I recall from that was a random guy hitting on me & then me reluctantly letting him hold my hand; it felt so strange & I made an excuse to go to the bathroom with my girl, where I made love to her in the stall & took off from. I didn’t want to go back home, since I’d miss her & have to face my haunted house. When I got home though, I remember I was able to fly (it was so freaking cool- I flew over people and everywhere... I could both feel myself flying & observe myself doing this from higher). I could fly everywhere except over a bridge. I remember trying to take off from the base of the bridge, flying very high/ too high, and coming back down again, unable to break the barrier of the bridge. (I’m sure that symbolizes a very tough obstacle that my desire to take the easy way through will not work, although I’m not sure which desire it is).All in all, this was the strangest and best dream I’ve had in a while. Please offer any insights as to what this might mean, if you have any.

0.0,8k4p10,0.0,2.0,"Every once and a while, I'll experience an ultra-vivid dream that feels so profoundly real that in the few moments after I wake up, I lose sense of what's actually real and what's not. Usually I am not myself in the dreams. Instead, I'm someone else, and I'm living out a clip of their life.

Recently I had another one of these dreams. It came in snippets, and in them I was not myself but someone else.

The first thing I remember is walking down a lane on a grey, overcast day. The trees are bare-looking, with only a few brown leaves clinging to them, and the air is chilly. The wind blows around me, and I hear it in my ears and feel it on my face. I'm walking by a chain-link fence, and I hear its clink and rattle. The pavement under my feet is broken up and spotted with tufts of brown grass. I'm in a rough part of town, but in a rural sort of way. I cannot over-emphasize how crystal clear the scene is to me. The details are crisp and sustained.

As I walk down the street, my stomach is in knots. I'm pushing down panic. I think to myself, ""If they haven't caught me yet, they don't know it was me."" Those exact words. I'm trying to reassure myself. 

I reach up to adjust the collar of my jacket. The jacket is leather. There is a folding knife in my back pocket. I'm in jeans but I don't know that by looking down at them or anything--I just know, they way you don't think about what shoes you have on but if someone asked you, you could tell them without looking down. I feel like the scene is in a time from the 80's or prior, because I don't have a cell phone and I have no sense that I should.

I've killed someone. The person I've killed is a woman. I've shot her. I feel the sensation of believing that it was sort of an accident, but sort of wasn't. Feels like cognitive dissonance in waking hindsight, but in my dream I was experiencing this guilt and dread at being caught and this heavy sensation that I knew this would follow me for the rest of my life. 

When I surfaced from the dream, its effects lingered so long and  that I really felt as though I was the one who had killed the woman. The best way I can describe it is that my brain was incorporating the dream into my mind as a memory, indistinct from my own identity. The dread and panic I felt upon thinking that I'd committed that crime are something I never want to experience again.

When she came close to whisper those spells in my ears all my hairs stood up and I became \*incredibly\* ""horny"" as if I was actually under a spell. It was like losing consciousness in real life and I couldnt think straight. Everytime she whispered it was like I was having an uncontrollable orgasm and in hindsight it was very upsetting.

I took them all back to my apartment and raised them in secrecy with my mom for a few months and got attached to them. The one day the cats all disappeared and I assumed they all just ran away. But then a few days passed and I kept hearing meowing but could never figure out where it was coming from and assumed I was hearing things. But then one of the cats showed up and meowed at me and my mom in the kitchen and disappeared into a hole in the wall.

We followed the meowing up the stairs and went up several floors and wound up at the door of a really old man and could hearing a bunch of meowing coming from inside. We knocked and the old man yelled help, and then we busted the door open and found the man had fell in his living room and couldnt get up, and the cats had been taking care of him until help came. Then for some reason the cats started talking to us as we helped him up and called 911. It turns out the cats were all guardians there to protect the man. The mom was an ancient Egyptian goddess, and 
the 3 offspring were all somehow related to the old man.

So anyways after the ambulance got there and left, me and my mom left the cats with the old man to keep him company.

I asked the cat ""and who would you be?"" and the cat whispered, ""I have to stay quiet."" and I said ""ok, fair enough."" and kept walking. But after I walked past the cat, the cat said in a young, female voice ""But I love you."" and then i turned around and looked at the cat, but then I woke up and I never got to find out who the cat was.

Lately I've had money problems with my seniors at school and I started asking money from other kids just so I can give money to the seniors(I'm not actually being bullied, It's a system at my school where I can get the benefits of extorting my juniors once I'm a senior),  I also don't have a girlfriend(the girl I really like is really obsessed with her ex and she usually chats with me to feel better about herself but I don't think she has any romantic attraction to me), and I really had bad grades that my parents are really disappointed cause I was such a great student when I was in middle school, just a lot of things that's giving me stress right now and I don't know if it has anything to do with my dreams but this is just how I feel.

0.0,8f87if,5.0,2.0,"So in this dream world, Halloween is very important. Not because people give out candy, but because they give out treasures instead... such as currency, pricey items, etc. Typically only small items though. Such as would fit in a halloween bag. Any who, the event is really important because a lot of people could make FORTUNES off of this annual night. (I know, it is economically just terrible... but its a dream ok). Anyway, I am current age in this dream (16) and I make an ""ok"" bags worth, but am still eager for more even after most  houses went to sleep. So I scour the streets on the way home to look  for dropped items that people were foolish enough to drop. I take a different way then usual. I am crossing a grassy area with a about a 3 foot stream running through, its about 10 inches deep. There is a bridge. But this bridge is made out of a box that has a hump going long ways, as opposed to short ways like a pirate treasure chest. It looks very worn, but still looking airtight-ish. So I walk over it and In hear its hollow. I feel there might be some treasure inside. (Idk why it was a given curiosity.) I crack open the lid (there was no lock on it). And inside are 2 boxes, one rectangular shape and one a smaller square shape. Both big enough to fit small items in such as an apple in the small one and a pair of shoes in the rectangle one. Theres also something else... A naked very pale dead girl is balled up. (look up ""heart escape lessening pose"" and that is the pose she's in, but she is on her back.) She is dripping and wet but there is no water in the box. She has a gaping slash above her left breast. It looked like there were stitches pathetically trying to hold the open wound close. I look at her face and realize its my girlfriend and I get a terrible shock through my body. She opens her eyes and speaks. (She is still dead but is just post-mortem communicating) She says to pick one, referring to the boxes. I open the rectangular one to find a knife. A crude one forged out of Damascus steel. A very beautiful and difficult forging technique, look it up. It also had a bone handle. I pick it up and look at her badly stitched wound. And I automatically know whats in the other box, her heart. I look at her stitches and know the knife I was holding was used to carved out her heart. I then look at her again and her eyes are closed and she is completely still and dead again. I didn't check the other box to make sure the heart was there. I just knew to leave, I felt terrified but also very sadden and sober-minded. Like I had uncovered a truth of sorts and found closure, a sad closure. I walk a few feet away with the knife, not giving a care in the world about the treasures I once held in my hand and bag, the dream ends.

Questions I would like answered:

I think why my girlfriend was soaked was because she was probably drowned in the creek and then she had her heart carved out after death. Am I possibly the killer and just don't know it in the dream?

Does the halloween riches event mean something or only lay importance of comparison to the knife at the end?

What does the heart and knife mean?

Does it mean something bad that I took the knife instead of the heart, Even though I consciously knew the heart was in the smaller box.

What does this mean referring to my relationship with her?

This was one of the most vivid dreams of my life. I could feel the cold water of the creek. The chill of the air, the warmth from the streetlights. The steel of the knife. The texture of the wood.

Either way, the other day I had a very strange dream that has been on my mind ever since. I thought it was pretty funny, and the dream itself wasn't by any means scary or ominous feeling.

I was getting a little frustrated and just wanted to leave, but she kept me there and started showing me a catalog full of Ulta Beauty mail-order husbands and how many points you needed for them!

As of writing this, I just woke up from one typical dream that was filled with recurring themes. And immediately wrote this realization down in my Dream Document about my dreams:

""Dream comments: I am always able to tell cardinal directions in my dreams, each direction corresponds with the proper direction in real life if there is a setting that is familiar as well. Each direction seems to have either alterations to it in familiar areas or simply just similar imagery. The one I've most meditated on is the West. The West has the following characteristics: an ocean, or at least some kind of wide expanse; thunderstorms always come from this direction (this is true in my real life too, storms always come from the west; storms are also omnipresent as a looming feeling of doom but also transcendence in my dreams); beings who are unknown, judgmental to me, or hostile to me manifest themselves in the West and move east; associated with the masculine; many men simply exist in this direction, and it is tamed civilization; And I always want to go west. East is another direction which I've been able to discern. It has characteristics that span over different dreams too: what is to my east is always what is familiar to me i.e. WLU campus, city of KW; the past is that way, going east is always associated with reliving a memory in my dream; it's populated, people live here whether they have issues or are content with life; and all living things; usually associated with the feminine, lots of women come from the west, and the natural world is situated there; and large motions (like a building tipping) move toward the West and come from the east. I am able to tell North and South, but at this time I am unable to tell any similarities of those directions in my dreams.""

I am curious as to what you think about this realization. I find it strange that I am always able to tell what direction is which by instinct. Also the images that are similar have common themes about them too.",top,Just woke up now and had this revelation about my dreams!,2.0
0.0,8bsyj9,2.0,2.0,"I had this last night:

I was walking it the woods, woods like in Kentucky, some idea like it was a national park or forest or some vast unowned space. I had a pack on and was making my way up a hollow, having already passed down and walked along the lower middle a ways. Trees were very tall and very old and green. I wasn't walking a trail, odd to do for something as vast as I felt the area was. I was trying to get to the top where the forest broke for a large unplowed possibly abandoned pasture field, the kind good for wildlife. I was going to try and find my bearings. I wasn't lost, you people who backpack hike as I do will understand this, I was just trying to peg myself down more. See where I was within a hundred yards or so. 

Around then I spot this figured; dark, not facing me and in a hood about 50 yards off in the same hollow as me, the woods are very thick. I'm surprised but not frightened by the figure. Hooded wax cloth ponchos are not uncommon for hikers in places with dense wood and briar like Kentucky, I'm Kentuckian btw. After a moment though I realized there's something not right about this figure, it's not a hiker. The fabric the form are odd, I don't call out to it as I was going to. Then it turns around and faces me, just a black hooded cloke, no face just black; think black rider but less hunched, no horse, no whispering.

 It starts running towards me, I run away. It's fast really fast but I'm not sure how I move quick enough to keep the distance and duck behind a tree, maybe 50 yards from where I was. How it doesn't see me I don't know. It really should have, as I could see it easy. It's moving it's body back and forth rather than it's neck looking for me, can't spot me.

Just then two riders come to the edge of the wood, having ridden across the the field that seems to cut into the huge forest, the field being very long and very narrow. The field is half broken by odd  lone trees,  wood covered brooks or old irrigation creek ditches. The creature, something I view in the dream as possibly supernatural/demonic and most certainly not human is male I feel. I too am male if that helps those wondering if it's a fear of strange lone males. It begins a run up the hollow wall, a fairly steap and wooded dirt hill. This not mountain hollow but like in Western Kentucky with flat land, creeks, rolling low hills, and shallow hollows. 
He's he's running up hill, it's then that I notice two things. One is the sized of the hooded figure, 4'6""-5' tall and maybe 100lbs. Again, I don't doubt the figure isn't human as I'm seeing it in the dream, because I know that if it was someone of that size would be no threat to me, and I'm very affraid of this figure. The second thing I notice is a short sword, maybe a long knife. It's curved like a scimitar, it's hard to see it because he's running so fast and it's small and thin bladed. Handle is rough made, ancient looking, and looks to be wood or more likely some primative light brown alloy; it has the rough look of being made to look like some generic bone. The blade of the sword is steel and razor sharp, neither shiny nor dull, like well sharppened but not polished steel.

The riders have dismounted and tied their reins tho the branches of trees before they see the thing and starts running after them. There are two of them, a woman in hiking expencive garb with lovely dirty blonde hair, and a man with dark hair and dressed about as expensively as I do, $50-$100 clothes as apposed to 200+ like her. She is very beautiful, he's handsome but not to the same degree. I felt like they were a unmarried couple, but she some how a little bit out of his league.

 They see the thing, it see them. She says to leave the horses that they would go run and hide instead. They start off across the narrow field, mostly because it's in the opposite direction, it's on them to fast to hide. I'm somehow seeing all this dispite being in the hollow. They run very fast and gracefully, nearly as quick as thier horses had. They reminded me of deer, running in long and graceful leaps. But the hooded figure is gaining on them, running in driven almost mechanical short quick strides, raw energy rather than grace. 

They come to a line of thin wooded trees, one of the old irrigation creek ditches, it slows them. It overtakes them and begins slashing them. I expect thier death when I saw it close in on them in the ditch, though I hoped she might escape as it killed him trying to protect her, but I never expected it to just slash at them not caring if the strike killed or just mared. It just slashed again and again, parts of them falling away, even after they were dead it slashed over and over again. I expected to have killed them fast and clean and then to eat them, or carry them away for some purpose if only to hide them, or even to kill them fast so as to come hunt for me. Instead it just hacked them up. I wanted really bad to save them, her as he died quicker, but there was no way I could get there in time. They ran faster than me, not to mention the creature. Also I knew there was nothing I could do to save them, as it would kill me too.

I was in terror; I'm usually very brave in my dreams, even my nightmares. Not that I don't get frightened, but only briefly and then I usually try to out smart or fight. However in this I was completely overwhelmed and affraid. 

My last thoughts were getting away, getting out of the woods before it could find me. I thought I should tell someone, tell them about what had happened and about the creature in the hood. Thought I should go and get a gun or a some weapon with others to help and kill it. But I felt like what ever we got might not kill it, that it might be to unnaturally strong and fast for us and that maybe regular weapons might not kill it. I remember hating it and wanting to take revenge and protect others from it, but then thinking that I might not be able to.

Also if this helps:

• there was a light wind and looked  like it might rain in any given moment and might have recently. 

• I felt like the figure was very ancient, not human, physical but supernatural, lived in the woods, and something completely foreign to myself and knowledge. Some new old monster or something

0.0,8bnxtj,1.0,2.0,"I had a dream recently that I was driving my truck (18-wheeler) with my son in the passenger seat, with an unassuming short plot leading to a load that took us down the wrong path. My truck was hit by several projectiles of some kind while driving down the road, but managed to roll through the first couple and maneuver around a couple more. But after a few direct hits to my side of the vehicle, the truck finally jackknifed into the ditch. Only a couple of minutes later, two more trucks came and pulled off the road where we were stuck, and I figured they were there to help, but the drivers got our and were arguing about which one of them would get to “take them in”. I didn’t understand, but shortly afterward, one of them shot me with something that caused me to go unconscious. The next thing I remember is being locked in a small metal room with a door on either end. Occasionally men would walk by, sometimes mocking me, other times just ignoring me, but I did not reply. Eventually, the door on the side at which I would see men walking opened to reveal a small holding cage attached to it. From it, a large angry-looking dog (probably a Bull Mastiff or maybe Am Staff) emerged and began to circle around me, looking at me and growling. After a couple of revolutions I could see that the dog was trying to intimidate me, so I stepped in front of him to block his path and faced him. He stopped and looked up at me in confusion. This was obviously not the reaction he had anticipated. I took advantage of this momentary lapse of aggression and put my hand on the top of his head and pushed it down in a gentle but firm manner, at which he bore his teeth a little but ultimately allowed me to turn his face downward and his ears relaxed. At this point, one of the men outside of the cage called the dog’s name (I can’t remember what the name was) and said “Attack!” It hesitated for a moment before pushing back against my hand and biting my forearm. He didn’t get a good hold, though, since my hand was still on him, now gripping the scruff of his neck. I reached out with my other hand and when he went for it I gave a shove with the hand that was holding him, grabbed his head with both hands and pulled it sideways to take him off balance, brought him to the ground, and pinned him there with one hand on the base of his skull behind the ear and the other on his midsection. He struggled for a moment, then submitted. I held him down for a moment until his breathing relaxed a little, then I let him up. He stood up and looked at me as though he were a completely different animal than the one which had first entered the cage with me. He looked relaxed and almost friendly. Again the man yelled “Attack!” He looked from me to the man and back to me, but did not attack. He simply sat and began to wag his tail, and we had a moment of connection as we looked at each other, realizing that we were both captives being forced into this futile struggle. The man did not seem upset by the dog’s disobedience. He pressed a button on the wall and the door on the other side of the cage opened, and a shrill voice called the dog from the other side of the door. It put its head down and walked through with its tail between its legs. I heard a short yelp and followed through the door. I was now in a larger room with white walls and a door on the opposite wall, as well as two very small doors. The dog wasn’t there. Instead there was a very small, very creepy looking person. She looked almost like a little girl, coming only to my waist with a large head and large brown eyes. She had curly black hair in pigtails, very pale skin, and dark makeup around her eyes. She was almost expressionless and holding at her side a small whip with multiple leather tassels. She didn’t look at me as I examined her. She just stood motionless. Next, one of the small doors opened, and another dog entered through it; this time a German Shepherd puppy. It walked promptly over and sat next to the girl. She put what looked like a small piece of raw meat in front of its nose, then pulled it away when it tried to lick it. Then the other small door opened, and a toy poodle entered, shaking, and walked over to stop in front of the girl. The the girl said in her shrill voice “Do you want him to suffer?” The German Shepherd pup stood up on its hind legs as though it was begging. This was clearly some kind of conditioning. She then whipped the poodle, and when it gave out a yelp she gave a piece of raw meat to the puppy. She did this a few more times, giving the observing dog a treat every time the poodle cried out. Then she laid the whip down on the ground in front of her and looked down. The puppy stopped begging and looked at her, then looked at the whip. He went to grab the whip, probably thinking that this was the key to getting treats, but she pushed him away from it and said “No!” The puppy looked up at her in confusion. She then kicked the poodle hard, and again gave a treat to the puppy when it winced. At this point the puppy seemed to realize that the poodles cries of pain seemed to be the key to getting the treats, so it began to bite and scratch it, getting a treat each time the defenseless dog cried out. She was teaching it cruelty. With each treat the puppy became more violent with its attacks until it had gripped the poodle’s throat and was about to kill it, at which point the girl scolded it and began to lead both dogs back to their doors. I then heard the door behind me open, and I turned to see my son walk into the room. He yelled “Dad!”, and we ran to each other for a hug. He seemed a little shaken up, but was otherwise okay. The girl walked over to us and stood in front of my son, who was a little bit taller than her. She asked him a question that I can’t remember and he began to answer, but his words were jumbled and didn’t make much sense. She asked him again with the same affect. Then she looked at me and asked “Why does he not answer?” I began to say “My son has —“ but he interrupted me, saying very clearly “Dad no! Don’t tell them. Don’t let them know.” I was puzzled by this, and the girl clearly was as well. She looked at me expectantly, so I continued, saying “My son has a developmental delay, and he doesn’t communicate well.” The girl’s eyes widened at this, and she hurried to an intercom on the wall and began to talk to someone excitedly through it, but I couldn’t hear what they were saying. Then she turned around and shot me with something to again knock me out, and the room faded away as I looked up at my son crying over me.
The next thing I knew, I was sitting in an armchair alone in a room, knowing that I had been released while he had been kept, when some of my family members came in, and one of them said “It’s time to remind someone what being a parent means.” I followed them to a room with a bunch of kids playing in it, not understanding why they thought I would want to see kids playing freely, knowing that my son couldn’t do these things. I was so depressed that I could barely look at them and I was holding back tears. I went over to a corner to be alone. I looked at my phone to find that there were Snapchat messages from an unknown number. I opened them to find that they were pictures of one of the men that stopped on the side of the road and abducted us with captions taunting me about my missing son. I took a video of the sequence of messages, then I ran to my sister and told her that we needed to call to police in case they could find something in the messages that could help lead to my son, but she told me that they’ve seen them and they can’t trace the phone or its location. At first I didn’t understand how they could have seen them when I myself just saw them, but I looked at my gallery to find that there were about a dozen videos just like it, and they had been sending me daily taunting messages. I had blocked out the memory. Only when I woke up did I realize that one of the children playing was my other, younger son. I wanted to go back to sleep because I felt somehow certain that we would find him or he would escape, and I wanted to finish the dream and get to that happy ending, but I had responsibilities in the real world and could not go back to sleep. Now I realize that it was probably just wishful thinking, and I don’t think it was meant to come to a happy end.

I’m not a vivid dreamer and I have never or at least don’t remember having a dream that lasted more than a few seconds. A few years ago I had the most vivid dream of my life and I can’t come to terms of what happened and what it meant. Nothing led up to it happening and nothing had happened after. So here’s how my dream went... 

I’m driving someone in a foreign country (I know this because the street signs are not English). And I have someone in the car with me in a military uniform rambling in another language and pointing to a building that he instructs me to stop at. As I’m driving up the the building which seems like some sort of fast food building there are a good number of kids running around playing and as I pull up they all stop and point at the building as well. 

I stop the car in the parking area and get out of the car and begin to walk towards the building. The man in the car did not follow and everyone outside just continued to point. I make it to the front door, I open the door and step in. I looked behind me and everyone outside was gone. Cat was still parked but everybody disappeared. I turn back around and it seems like I’m in a restaurant about to make an order.

No one is around and the restaurant seems empty. As I walk up to the booth a lady slowly walks around a corner and up to the booth to greet me. She doesn’t say anything but as I go to say something she turns around and suddenly she has no shirt on. On her back is a tattoo of a boy holding a red balloon. 

She stays perfectly still but the tattoo seems to move... as this happens I seem to transition to a different dream area... im suddenly in a city... everyone is looking up at the top of a building and I see a boy holding a red balloon... for some reason I walk towards the building and go inside. I see nothing but a dimly lit stair case... I decide to go up the stairs. 

I start going up and I hear strange noises as I walk up... almost like crying. As soon as I get to the top of the stairs there’s a door. I open the door and I see the boy at the ledge of the building holding the balloon. Before I say anything he turns around and smiles at me and gently steps off and begins to fall. 

I tried running at him but all I could do as walk... (kinda like when you fight in a dream and your punches are in slow mo) so I walk up to where he fell and there’s still the balloon there... just floating where he had stepped off. I walk up and grab the balloon and look down to see a crowd staring back up at me and freaking out but no body down below. 

I start to cry and then I hear a sound behind me... I looked behind me and I saw myself walking slowly towards myself from the door I had just walked through. I wanted to freak out but I smiled instead and just took a step off the ledge. I remember falling and looking up and seeing the balloon staying in place. 

*****This is when I woke up. I wrote this down years ago and it was so vivid and I couldn’t get it out of my head. Does anyone have any interpretation of this????*****

Okay, so I had a dream this weekend that we had put a new privacy fence up in our front yard and one of those big wooden swingsets. We had gone somewhere and left my kids with two of my brothers. When we were pulling into the drive, there were ambulances and my moms old car out front of our neighbors house. We went into their house and two of my brothers laid dead in the floor. My grandfather and my mother sat on the couch calm as could be. My granddad looked at my mom and said ""she took the same drive through that fence that I did that ruined you"". Then I find out that the neighbor has driven through our fence and not only killed two of my brother, but also my two children. My mom showed me a picture of them mangled up in the fence and it was like I wasn't even concerned which is super strange because my kids are my absolute world. I was only concerned with my youngest brother, who laid on the floor, eyes wide open, with a hole straight through his belly.

My guess is that the ""tank"" and ""being eaten"" parts are because I feel trapped and/or not leading a very active life, which is true, but - being an introverted person - socializing also makes me feel very uncomfortable.

Right went the bisons, middle went the horses. I went left, now changed into a horse rider. The task was to run uphill into a forest. A group of riders on the right had a problem with their horses. 
In this world killing the bisons was forbidden. Skinning the animals for pelts and furs was also forbidden. People were dissatisfied (they thought that pelts and furs would make their lives easier). 
The riders stop for a rest, they won't go further, so I pass them. I take the road uphill to the dark forest. Near the entrance I slay a giant wolf, then i skin it. I arrive near a wooden cabin. Everything is dark, almost pitch black. I took the pelt and gave it to the person inside the cabin so he could make me a piece of clothing. I couldn't see him, I only heard his voice.

It was like a greenish park with lots of trees, just basically the cliche serene place to start. I remember it was a fairly young girl, blonde (maybe 18 since I am 23), crystal blue eyes and a simple plain sky blue dress and that redness blondes have with their cheeks. I said to her ""I really like you"" and she then said ""surely you don't mean that, look at how two of my teeth stick out"" her fanged teeth (it was barely noticeable). Then i hugged her and said ""don't say such nonsense. You are beautiful and make me feel weirdly happy when I look at you."" I hugged her close to me really tightly. I swear the hug felt super real, long and intimate. I woke up because it felt so intense in a good way. Do you think that is me embracing my anima? Idk why but i felt so happy and so sad at the same time.

In particular, that scene reminds me of the early stages of my then gf...just pure love and kindred spirits. I guess, despite being against the notion of relationships, cuz actual reasons, I really would love to do that with a girl...just that life is stranger than fiction.

The first scene was odd because it was home alone-esque. Basically, I made sure that my child was trained in safety measures. Like crawling underground when an intruder comes in and activating an alarm that would cause the intruder to submit (i guess underground so that the child would not get hurt by the frequency as well as being safe).

Not that it makes watching people I love getting killed in front of me any easier, but it's something that I live with.

Last night's, though, was a little more unusual.

I was being taken through a forest in the mountains, not terribly different from where I grew up, by a friend of mine.  The woods got deeper and darker as we journeyed in.  Unnaturally dark.  Eventually, we came to a small wooden building.  I entered.  It was set up akin to a waiting room, and there was a window in the back looking outside.

I was greeted by several people I've known throughout life who are...long gone.  And I realized, the forest I went through was not a real one.  This was part of the journey to the afterlife.  I was in the process of dying.

I immediately turned and ran back out the door I entered in, only to find myself in a room full of ravenous monsters.  There would be no running back to the world of the living.  I was here, and I was going to be ushered on to my final destination.  I re-entered the waiting room, and was taken to look out the back window.

Outside, there were a variety of mines, run by demonic beings.  The souls of the damned were being forced to work there for all eternity.  Those who were found worthy...well, they move on to another step, which none of these people in the waiting room had gotten to yet.  They told me to be brave, and that whatever will be, will be.  Not very reassuring.

Eventually, a figure that I knew to be Death came in.  He was covered from head to toe in a black robe, his features inscrutable.  Adorning his neck was a necklace, with a silver skull with ruby eyes, and a silver cross.

He came up to me, and threw off the hood of his robe.  The face of Death, shockingly, was not a skull, but an elderly, kindly, African-American man.  He had glasses and curly white hair.  He bid me come with him.  We went out the back of the waiting room, into the woods, passing the mines.

He talked to me a bit more about the afterlife, and asked me if I was ready to go.  I told him, as ready as I was ever going to be.  He smiled.  And then, I started floating.

Then everything was black and I heard the voice of the older boy narrate ""and then I woke up to the point of a knife on my forehead"".

Then everything went third person again. The older boy then grabbed the knife, turned it around, and pressed it into the girl's forehead. The last thing I remember seeing is what messed me up.. The boy looked straight at me with his mouth cut all the way to his ears and said something..I can't remember what.

Backstory... I have a neighbor who is kind of a strange person. Haven't really figured him out yet and in the 5 years I've known him we've not really been on that great of terms. (Hes kind of a weirdo.) He's like a manager of a construction company. Anyway in my dream, I came home one day and my house was surrounded by police. When I went in my home there was an underground tunnel Doug from my house to my neighbor's house and inside the tunnel there was a bunch of like, illegal gold or money stored. Was kind of odd.

Also sorry for the typos, literally wrote it as soon as I woke up! Thanks guys, any info but would be appreciated. 

I’m hungry and felt like takeaway, so did my sister libbie. I knew that the close ones wasn’t open yet as it was only around 4pm. I had started my job so I had money and was finally getting back on my feet. In the dream Woolfall shops (they were knocked down a few years ago irl) were still there with the takeaway, so we walked over. It was empty except for 2 kids, they must of been about 9 and 7. The little girl was trying to pay but didn’t have enough money. She started to cry and said that there was no other food for them and her mum and dad were really sad. I stepped forward and asked who was eating them and she said “me, my brother, big sister and my mum and dad” my heart sunk, the poor family. I got two large portions of fries for them and told the girl to keep her money and give it back to her parents. I decided I’d walk back with them and explain that I’d paid just in case they thought I was weird or something. Libbie was hesitant but she came with me. I held the little girls hand, she took a shine to me. The boy was quiet and just walked ahead. When we got there I was greeted by a smaller balding man, the smell of the house hit me and I knew this family were in need. I told him I offered to pay for the food and asked the little girl to give her dad the money back. His eyes watered and shook my hand and thanked me from the bottom of his heart, libbie moved closer and looked at me, she knew what I knew, this family needed help. He asked me to come in, so the rest of the family could thank him. Their mum sat on the sofa, her dark hair turning grey. Just by a quick glance you could tell she was struggling. She seemed a bit angry and said that her family wasn’t a charity, and to which I agreed but I couldn’t sit back and not let a family have a meal. In the end she accepted and thanked me too, their oldest daughter seemed around 13, she was tending to a baby, the mother had another who was a toddler, who seemed like he had a disability of some sort. I just stood in the living room and took it all in, there was one couch, a tiny tv the walls hadn’t been painted and the floor was old laminate. I felt incredibly sad and overwhelmed. The eldest daughter came out the kitchen with the baby, he seemed like he was only a few weeks old. She complained he kept throwing up like a tar or dark bile. The mother said it was fine and he’d been like that a while. I knew it wasn’t normal and apologised for butting in, in case I may be wrong and I didn’t know something they did about the baby but I explained that it wasn’t normal and that he’d need to be seen too. The mother defended herself, and of course she has every right to its her baby. She shouted and screamed saying he has been like that since he came and she can’t afford to pay for medication and that. I couldn’t just let this baby stay sick and not get treated. She cried telling me she couldn’t do it anymore, that she never expected her life to be like this. I told her I’d be back and went the kitchen to the father and explained to him, he too was just as upset. I asked for plates and dishes out the food, took the baby boy and tried to nurse him. She was on the last of her milk for him. Once the children had ate I helped her put them to bed, their room was bare, the odd toy and one bed. Me and libbie told them a story while the mum put the toddler to bed. After that, I went back to the baby, I said he couldn’t be left like that and he needed help. I’d take him the hospital and pay for treatment over the counter if needed, I’d take him off her hands for a few days. That’s when she confessed that the child didn’t belong to the father of the house, she had to pimp herself out and got caught. She said she couldn’t bare to look at the child and that she was a disgrace. I looked at libbie and then the boy. “I’ll have him then, you can see him whenever you like” she stared at me, tears streaming and got up from the couch with him, and handed him over to me. He was weak and fragile, she looked at me deeply in the eyes and then went to the kitchen, I heard mumbling and sobbing between the mother and ‘father’. They shuffled back in, hand in hand. And nodded “ok” she cried. She packed his few items, the baby didn’t even have a pram or cot. I told them everything would be ok and they wouldn’t see the last of us, we’d get them help.

In the dream I was in my school walking through the halls with a bunch of other people in my grade and we were all walking to the lunch area. My best friend was right next to me too. Somehow, something made me realize that this was a dream and I turned to my friend and asked if she also realized that this was a dream but she just simply said she didn't know with a smile. When we all arrived at the cafeteria, everyone sat down at the table and I looked up to see what I presumed to be a teacher. I never saw this teacher at my school and he doesn't even exist in my school so it was weird. He looked thin with pale white skin, glasses and light brown hair. Then he said that we were all going to ""move on"". At first I didn't understand what this meant until it hit me, everyone here was going to commit suicide. I turned to my friend and asked if she thinks this is abnormal and she said no with the same empty smile. I started panicking. He told everyone to close their eyes and was repeating other instructions but I didn't hear well since I covered my ears. I was fully conscious in this dream and was just repeating over and over in my head ""someone help me, save me, wake up"". At one point I heard the teacher say that he was going to summon a demon for the final step of the mass suicide. At the point I must've repeated to ""wake up"" in my a head a hundred times so this time I simply opened my eyes to see some heads turn to glare at me and the teacher was eyeing me down with an irritated face. It was as if they knew I was trying to get out of this dream. I immediately closed my eyes and ears and tried to focus on my physical body in the real world. It was very strange, I could feel my body in the physical world but I was still in the dream. I tried to open my eyes in the real world and tried to move my body but I was paralyzed (obviously since I was dreaming). I didn't give up and slowly I felt my fingers start to move. All I saw was the teacher coming closer and closer to me with the same angry face. I was very scared and so desperate to wake myself up. Finally I could move my whole hand and I could open my eyes halfway and the second I did, I was out of the dream, as if everything seemed to just poof out of existence. It was a very scary experience and I never knew something like this could happen. Can anyone explain this to me? Is this tied to my subconscious?

I posted this to r/Wicca first.

I don't mean that in a vague ""I woke up from life's dream"" I was asleep until two or three minutes ago. I was having a really intense dream. I'm attempting to remember it here because I feel it was significant. 

I can't remember the setting, I can only remember the fear and feeling of imminent battle. We were about to go into an age of battle, and we, the Humans are the weakest race. Though I don't know who said that, but I vaguely remember it was a tall man. I remember my cat was there, very prominently. He was attacking me. As he does. (he doesn't know how to play properly, so he ends up being really rough.) I was afraid of him, my cat, as well. This was my cat in my waking life. Demeanor and everything. 

Events are hazy, but I had gotten angry and scared him. I remember..... someone saying something along the lines of ""There's an old Indian (Native American) god who counts. He counts up and up and when he stops the world stops. The world stops when the last living thing stops counting."" 

Then I remember a muscular male figure, with a blurry face, the face was as if it had a gradient blur in the shape of a triangle going out. 

I woke up. Afraid. I feel things around me. Sure my girlfriend is lying next to me. But I feel the thing in my closet, the thing in the hallway who keeps creeping and staring, I felt things standing over me. My stomach hurts, hurt worse while I was afraid. Like condensed raw panic. 

Has anyone been so afraid that they have to curl up in a ball and hide because their stomach is in knots? 

Well, I was left with...Why do I fear the spiritual? Why do I fear? 

Anytime I wake up if I wake up before the sun rises I feel intense fear of waking up at 3 am. For some reason. 

This has persisted since I was a child. I used to wake up at 3 am every night. sheets off me some nights (I might be misremembering that though) I just know for a fact I can't sleep with my feet out. Something might get me. From a young age I used to fear the thing in the closet to the point I would put a rosary wrapped around the closet doors. (at the time they were a pair of doors that opened french style into a shallow closet) I did this even when I switched rooms. I wrapped it around the door handle of the closet. It was my Grandfather's, it would protect me. I was NEVER Christian, or religious. I hated the few times I was dragged to church because I slept over my friend's house. So It's not that I was thinking the devil was after me per se, but it definitely felt evil, something was there to get me. 

From then on I've had this ball of fear of the spirits surrounding me. I know they're there. I feel them watching me. Why do I fear... It's a question I think I need to answer. I've never told anyone this before. No one would believe me, or listen. Write me off...

It just so happens I celebrated Ostara today, my first Wiccan ritual, and holiday. (It was nice by the way, I had fun) Might be a coincidence, but this dream felt like some direct... ""Questions to my Questions"" that I feel guides talk in. 

I don't like to think I'm crazy, like schizophrenic, but sometimes I feel things I just can't explain, and I feel insane. What am I afraid of? 

The question was asked like...... ""You're afraid of the mundane, what are you afraid of"" Maybe I've answered my own questions, maybe I forgot to ask any... Like I said I literally just woke up. 

Does anyone have any thoughts?

I was able to fool them, and was invited to a huge party in their villa. My father specifically requested me to trash their wine bank.

I've had this dream the other day, and I wrote it down immediatly after I woke up, I tend to do this while I dream, in case I forget them. I had this dream back in March 14th, if that matters.

It almost doesn't make any sense, so I believe it's something highly abstract and might have some subconscious meanings to it, IDK. If anyone knows what it might mean, please leave a comment... 

Thank you.

I've finished school already, but I dreamt that I was there with some people (I think I knew them but I forgot them now) with a little detail: The school was externally like the Bus Station. Like if you went to the White House, and it's just like the White House from the outside, but inside it's exactly like YOUR house... and I don't know the reason for that...
Moving on, I got there in my parents' Car (a red FIAT Linea) - don't remember if I was the driver... I can't drive in RL BTW. While everyone was out there with their guns and masks on, I stood in the car because I forgot to bring a mask with me, so I had an idea: in the car there was a pillow, so I took the pillowcase off and used it as a mask. When I went outside it was very calm, I was wearing the pillowcase (it covered 100% of my head but I could see because it's kinda translucid, idk. Just put a pillowcase on and you'll understand it... it's still visible) and I asked 2 guys outside if they had some scissors so I could cut holes for my eyes. I held an SMG with me.

[memory gap]

Next, I remember being without my ""mask"", but still with my gun. So a teacher I had in 3rd grade (back in 2009) saw me and started to mock me like ""A-ha! Look at you! I got you! You're busted"" while laughing. She was joined by another teacher, and we all walked back to the car (I was shitting myself because I didn't know that this was a dream, so I was afraid of what she could possibly do). Back to the car, I ask her if she's gonna tell anyone about it and she says she will. I give her an excuse that this was just a play, I saw those guys with guns and I wanted to pretend I was one of them (SUPER excuse!). She then says ""But I saw you talking to some dealers (even though we were robbers, I didn't get this part)"", then I say ""yeah, well... that's because I know him. That guy is a friend of mine"" (I can't remember now if it really was a friend of mine).

Luckily, the woman who was joining us said ""Yes that's true. I know him too, he even has a job, etc.""

His funeral was held that day and he had died five days before he was discovered. He had died of a heroin overdose. I can't say I was surprised or shed a tear on his passing. But, they had two sons and whatever his faults, his children loved him. I know in his way he loved them too. I was livid that his parents waited until it was over to tell my sister. His own children could not go to their fathers wake and service. They invited my sister and the kids over. They were ambushed with a video of the funeral with many shots of him in his coffin.

The Dream

I have a reoccurring dream in which I discover he has faked his own death. Last night, I had a dream I found him wearing a disguise at which point I exclaimed, ""I f****** knew it!"" The dream itself happens every now and then. 

What I think it means:

In my culture, seeing the body is part of the healing process. At the end, when the body is buried, soil is put on the shovel and we grab a handful and throw it in. It's our way of moving forward and allowing our loved ones to go on to find peace. Maybe because I never saw his bloated corpse, this is why I dream it. I never got that closure but I don't think I need it. I have/had no love for him. The world is a better place without him in it. I know I sound very cold. But, this man destroyed our family and fractured our relationship with my sister and her children.

Without going too much into other misdirected thoughts, I had a dream last night that amazed me in its creativity. I won’t call it my creativity because I’m not sure if I should claim something as mine that I have no control over. 

I was in a sort of bar or tavern in the dream with my friend James. Just like there is today, there was a large storm coming, or already here rather, because outside the glass front of the tavern could be seen gale-force winds bending trees and violent dark clouds beginning to brew. Small spurts of rain were beginning to mix with the green vegetation that flew by the windows that had been ripped off the trees. What flew in the middle of this gale was something my waking mind has named ‘The Miyazaki Robot’.

It was a government drone for analyzing weather. It was a very futuristic drone, and what blew me away about the device is how incredibly concise the phenomenon was. The construction, the definition, the character of its movements and so on. It was as if I had looked into the future and simply observed something that already existed. 

The drone was probably 10 to 15 feet long. The main body of the drone was a long rectangle, perhaps with the dimensions of 1.5x3x15. Attached to this drone were series of thin, long wings, perhaps four or six in total. The drone and it’s wings were utilitarian white, that faded white associated with function and not form. There were no distinct markings on the drone. What was interesting about the wings was that they were joined to the drone with a ball joint, such as the arm is attached to the torso, and each one pivoted independently and with incredible acumen in order to navigate the incredible winds. Off the back of the drone, and why I call it the Miyazaki Robot, came two long tails mounted on either side of the rear of the drone. With the sort of weightless confidence seen in a Miyazaki when the wind takes a thing, the tails of the drone joyfully danced on the wind, their segmented, glial-cell like reticlations moving with an absolute organic spirit. 

This animated living spirit pervaded the movements of the drone. It’s wings shifted and swam in the wind, skipping on the currents like what it resembled most, a dragonfly. 

As I type this, I’ve realized I believe the impetus for this drone’s personification, and I believe it was the video I watched last night. The video detailed a group of researchers putting the copy of an earthworm brain into a neural network and using it with an AI inside a simulation. I am amazed that my subconscious, providence, clairvoyance, or whatever thing somehow used that bit of seemingly metaphysical information to construct the observable quality of this drone. 

Because as the drone skipped over the wind, it was clear that it was created in the likeness of a dragonfly. It’s wings functioned as a dragonfly’s would, it behaved like a dragonfly; commanding the air with such deftness and ease that challenges in flying are an afterthought. 

The dream ended with another peculiar. After I exclaimed in the dream, something along the lines of, “Oh look, there’s the governments drone”, I quickly realized that there was a river nearby the tavern, and that what separates the river from the tavern was a shallow field and nearly no elevation. I asked bartender, I believe, if the tavern had ever flooded. She responded hesitantly that it had in January, which was only a few months before. The tone of the dream really changed at that moment, I began to hustle, telling my friend James we had to leave, knowing that it would  be better to brave the gale than to stay inside the tavern and be flooded out. 

What intrigued me about this moment was when I began to ‘change’ direction in the dream; wanting to leave the tavern, all the talking stopped and many of the faces of the people in the tavern turned toward me and looked at me. The faces were expressionless, not happy, not worried, not sad or angry or annoyed, just sort of… blankly interested. It was as if they were looking at me unsure of what to do next.

It’s a random thought, but perhaps when I ‘decided’ in my dream to leave the tavern because it would flood, my conscious mind interacted with the dream in a lucid way because it was worried. This caused my ‘subconscious’ to be temporarily stumped and unsure how to respond, thus the confused people. Perhaps I’m looking at this a little too ignorantly, but it was like when you play against an AI in a video game, and you do something that the AI doesn’t really understand how to respond to. It just freezes or does something senseless. The very personified tavern patrons in my dream took on a very NPC-like characteristic when the direction of the dream shifted.

Let me preface this with some personal information: I am happily married for 3 years and expecting my first child later this year.

The dream:      I don’t remember much about the dream, except for one person. A woman, roughly my age. She has no name. Platinum dyed hair with a purple tint to it. Wavy angled bob cut. Large, brown eyes. Olive skin. Not thin, but not overweight. Fit but curvy. Dimples. I have a very vivid mental image of this person, but almost all of the other dream details are hazy. 

I do know that I spent a significant amount of time with the person in this dream, and I remember informing her of my marriage status. But I felt like I have known her for a very long time. 

When I woke up (kinda in that awake/ asleep stage), I kept trying to go back to sleep to catch her in my dreams. I felt a sense of mental and emotional completeness or fullness in the dream and immediately after I woke up. As soon as I was fully awake, I broke down in tears. This is not something I do... well... ever really. I spent all day yesterday with this woman on my mind. Partly trying to catalogue it. Partly in a semi-depressed state. Partly flabbergasted at how impacted I was by this mysterious individual in my dream.

Last night, I struggled to sleep. It’s as if my brain was trying to interject her back into the dream. Every time I would fall asleep and dream, I would immediately wake up half pissed/ half upset. I didn’t sleep much last night.

Today is more of the same as yesterday. I’m hoping that writing this down will maybe clear my mind. I’m hoping I can get some rest tonight. And, honestly, I’m hoping I get to meet this mysterious woman again and try to make sense of all of it.

Normally I never remember my dreams since I usually don’t dream so vividly. The dream was strange but what I really got confused about was this: I was walking with a bunch of strangers and happen to come across what looked like a booth. In it the lady claimed she does voodoo and I was all doubtful and thought it would be funny. Anyway , she did a weird dance and shouted some stuff and I was on my way. While walking a bird that reperesnts a vulture fell from the sky with his beak pointing right at me. For some reason in my mind if this type of bird follows you it meant death and sickness. The bird would be right next to my neck soaring with its beach almost touching my neck. It had a big smirk on its face.I got scared and decided I wasn’t going to let this bird follow me so I grabbed it(this part is gruesome,I love animals:( ) and cracked it neck.

“So I was part of this reporting group that had the job of broadcasting information and new developments about the plague. And my team of reporters was invited to this research group that were experimenting on insects to find the cause of the plague but also why the zombies were doing what they were doing (you know, like eating people and stuffs) 

When we got there, they had this new insect that they cross-bred that was half ant half bee. It looked like an ant, but it was huge and flew like a bee

And the head researcher was explaining that zombies ate other people not just because they have an insatiable hunger, but because they had this new quota to fill in this plague-infested society. So basically, the insects ate each other because they wanted to take out the weakest. And to the zombies, the weak ones were the humans still alive because zombies were immortal (unless they died the way other zombies died), they don’t feel pain, etc. So the zombies just wanted to take out the weaker ones—the humans”

0.0,7u3fsq,0.0,2.0,"I found a rather fascinating excerpt that describes what dreams actually are from the view of a very high level Qi Gong Master.

This excerpt is from the book ""Zhuan Falun"" which is a very interesting read in and of itself.

It talks about such things as other dimensions, the soul, the cosmos in the microcosm and the macrocosm, supernatural abilities, karma, healing, the true history of mankind, transcending the 5 elements and leaving the 3 realms and many many other interesting things.

The book can be download for free here:

http://en.falundafa.org/eng/pdf/ZFL2014.pdf

I will leave you with the excerpt in question about Dreams and Dreaming:

""Now about dreaming, there isn’t any qigong master who wants to explain it. When you were born, a ""you"" was born at the same time in many dimensions of the universe, and they’re part of the complete you, they’re interrelated, and their thoughts are interconnected.

And you also have your master soul, subordinate souls, and other beings, all kinds of them, and they have their images and exist in your body, and every cell and each of your organs assume the forms in which your image and messages exist in other dimensions.

So it’s just extremely complex. In your dreams things are one way one moment and then different the next. Where on earth do they come from, anyway? In the medical sciences they say that this is due to changes taking place in your cerebral cortex.

That’s how it is in this material form, but in reality, it’s the result of your being affected by messages from other dimensions. That’s why you feel all foggy-headed when you’re in a dream. But none of those things have anything to do with you, and you don’t need to pay attention to them.

There is one kind of dream that does directly have to do with you, though, and we can’t really refer to these dreams as dreams: it’s where your master consciousness, meaning, your master soul, sees your family approach you in your dream, or you have a real-to-life experience, or you see or do something.

If that’s the case, your master soul really did do something or see something in another dimension, it’s you who did it, and you were clearheaded and you had a real experience. Those things really do exist.

It’s just that they exist in other dimensions and they were done in other space-times. So can you say they’re dreams? You can’t. Your physical body on this side was definitely sleeping, so for you it’s just a dream. Only those dreams have a direct bearing on you.""",top,Fascinating View On Dreams,2.0
0.0,7u2lfy,1.0,2.0,"I’m going to describe this in the best way possible. I have always been one to have very vivid dreams, many times nightmares. There a few that actually stick with me and make me feel uneasy about things. There is a particular one that I have had twice within the span of the past 3 months. The first night it happened, I dreamed that I was with a group of friends going to some strange building. It looked more like a church, but I don’t remember the details of it, why, or how we got there. The inside was under construction. In my dream I am aware we are at this location, but my mind is questioning it. It’s kind of dark and I feel weird about it all. Some walking around and things happen here and there, but I get to a point where I am walking down a flight of stairs, and directly at the bottom across the steps, there are three statues from what it looks like at first glance. From the left, this one is standing behind the one in the middle. The outer left is the tallest. The middle statue is more upfront and but crouched. The outer right is standing straight up and average height. As I am walking down these stairs, I notice that they aren’t statues, that they are alive. As I get closer I examine them— they’re very lanky, and are wearing expressionless masks. The holes where the eyes are located are large and dark, and I cannot see their eyes, which starts to scare me. The outer left’s mask was red. The middle was white, the right was black. There were dark markings on the masks, like tribal patterns and the masks have long dark beards. Theyre outfits were like long robes. I notice all this walking down and I can’t take my eyes off them and my insides are screaming to quit looking. I know in my dream they are watching me closely. They move slightly and slowly, not stepping towards me or anything but I see their heads move as they watch me come down. I notice once I get to the bottom there is a HUGE door behind them. Big, wooden door and it’s closed. I feel very scared but curious. I stand there a little longer and me and these statues have a stare contest basically. They don’t come towards me but I know they’re examining me even though I can’t see their eyes. I finally get the courage to move and walk away, but they’re still watching me. I want to get out of the building. As I’m trying to exit, the walls are clearly moving and i see out of the corner of my eye the white mask looking at me but at this point I am too afraid to look back and I think it spooked me enough to wake me up. 

Second time, I only saw the black mask. Except this time it was different. It had a strange hat on, very wide and the ends were pointy. And it’s body was even more lanky and I could see through it’s robe in certain areas. In my dream, I was very conflicted. I’m not sure what it was, but I was doing normal things with this terrible fright something was going to happen. And I saw the black mask watching me. Almost everywhere I went in the dream, he was just standing in the background. Barely moving and not saying or doing anything. At the same time, I did not believe it was this thing that was causing my conflict, but watching to see what would happen with me. Nothing happened because I woke up abruptly. I have had trouble falling asleep since then. The second dream happened 3 days ago. 

SIDE NOTE: I told my friend about these things and he asked to show me a picture of Ancient Mesopotamian statues and creepily enough, they are similar but not quite. I have never seen anything like them before my dreams. He told me to not think about them so much or they will appear more.

Amongst other fragments, somewhere in the middle of the dream I had a very vivid scenario:

Walking along the beach (looked like my nearby town thats by the seafront) with two other people, I could see that the entire sea was covered with swans floating amongst some green plants, making the whole sea look like some kinda pond.

I then took a large pebble from the beach and threw it in the water, perhaps hitting one of the swans. This swan flew up to the beach very quickly, began making noises and trampeled me. I managed to get up and started running, whilst it was still chasing me, looking very agitated. The two people with me (I couldnt make out their faces) didnt help but told me to run behind some tent thing on the beach and hide behind it, after I did exactly that, the swan backed off.

I had a look at the dream dictionary to see that sucj dream could mean unfavourable changes. The only thing I can think of is starting a new job, as I've been unemployed for 5 months and will need to start work for the money, however I know that I'm really not looking forward to it.

Also I'm meditating and becoming more aware of signs that my consciousness sends me, so maybe its trying to tell me something through this dream? I never used to think that much of dream interpretations.

Any insight would be appreciated.

I didn't understand what I was looking at. Or why we hadn't left the city. A couple stone tablets lay by our feet, with a simple array of bumps and grooves on them.

Some rioters ran past the alley beneath us ... and *my brother came crawling up the roof*. He was wearing a turban, and was *asking us for change*. For some reason I said, ""This isn't a change shop."" But then, I pulled out a bunch of coins from my pocket and asked him if he knew how to count. *But they were modern day coins, and he was confused.* I told him, ""figure out the math problem [?] and you can keep the money."" He counted all the change ... and then *drew a line of paint/blood through the two biggest dots on the tablet* (division symbol) ... and *the mathematician was astounded*... And he declared, and I remember clearly:

> ""This is the end of antiquity, and the beginning of history.""

I looked at him, and looked at the words inscribed on top of the building: it was his name, but I don't remember what it was ... Something like ""Phosophocles"", something with two ""ph""s but they were written like this: ""P'osop'ocles"".

Then I told my brother, ""Let's take this change and get on the train."" ... And we crawled down the roof, and ran across a plaza, toward some big building. Before we entered, I noticed, far on the other side, *a kind of vortex had started to form*, like a tornado, only it was horizontal, and pointed toward us. ... We entered the building. And then we were in a subway station. But I felt like we were in yet another city.

The rest of the dream is a blur, involving my brother and I being accosted by *homeless beggars*, and then becoming separated again.

So, one of the first things I did when I woke up was google ""Euclid"", as he is the only Greek mathematician that came to mind. [This is second pic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid#/media/File:Scuola_di_atene_23.jpg) on his wikipedia page. I actually had no recollection that any mathematicians did work *on the floor*, as it was in my dream.

Here's a few main things that are probably causally related to me having this dream:

1.  I recently read a book of philosophy that frequently mentioned Euclidean geometry, and I had been thinking that I'd like to learn more math.

2. I'm currently playing Chrono Trigger, a video game about time travel.

3. One of my favorite characters in the game is the ""philosopher of reason"" called Belthasar, whose image ""P'osop'ocles"" seems to take after. Belthasar lives in an era that is frequently referred to simply as ""Antiquity"" ... He also has a servant, a little creature, who is immortal, and *can be found in all time periods*. I think in the dream I was P'osop'ocles' own ""immortal/time travelling servant"".)

Further, these details strike me:

- the cliche of a person being sent back in time, in order to contribute to the development of ancient people (notice we left as soon as it was done, since that's what gave us the money to go home).

- the mathematical revolution was done by the hands of a beggar, who was literally beneath us, and we the mathematicians were raised on a roof.

- the repeated archetype of the beggar, in the beginning, climax, and end of my dream.

- the apparent division of poor/wealthy in the Greek city.

- the fact that the mathematical revolution was done in blood/red paint.

- the fact that the math revolution was done in the middle/aftermath of disastrous riot (of unknown origin).

- the curious detail that I was only semi-aware that the Greek beggar was my own brother, until he had completed the math problem -- and that when I gave him a handful of *modern day coins*, somehow I felt this was a secret between us.

- archetypes of the ""winds of change"".

So that was my dream.

0.0,7rdm6i,0.0,2.0,"I've been having a recurring dream about my SO leaving me. There are certain aspects of the dream that are ALWAYS the same (he doesn't want to be together any longer, I am the one who leaves our home,  I'm upset and he's not, I want to get back together, and except for once, I move in with my mother after which we fight constantly.) The variables are crazy (he once had a girlfriend with Down Syndrome, once left for a very tall girl name ""Jody,"" I once moved to Colorado with my best friend from 8th grade, etc.) Well, last night really bothered me because we were together visiting my dad in the hospital, and I parked the car. When I walked in, he was hugging a girl with very long blonde hair. When I saw him I did a hand thing like ""WTF?!"" The girl comes over to me, and she looks kind of like me except I have shorter hair and she was younger. She starts telling me how she's a social worker (like me) a director in  her job (like me) and that even though my husband and her aren't having an affair any longer, he still comes to her house to do laundry ""in the  nude"" and that he's really just sweet and thoughtful. I am cussing her out, pushing her, trying to cut her hair off, etc. I end up lowering her into a pit in the floor that she can't get out of, and the whole time she's talking about how great my husband is. After this, I tell my SO I want a divorce, leave the hospital, and end up arguing with my mom at a thrift shop.

I'm pretty sure the recurring theme of him leaving me has to do with MY insecurities, but I'm wondering if the blonde woman is a version of me. We have a very long history together, but our relationship has been rocky. I've finally got to a place in my life where, as I approach 40, I'm finally figuring out who I am. So it also makes me wonder if my insecurities of losing him stem from the fact that I know I am changing from that girl of 15 years ago with long, bleach blonde hair who shaped herself into what HE wanted to the woman I am now, who is who I want to be, and I'm afraid he won't want me anymore?

IDK, I just wish I'd quit having the dream because I always wake up feeling upset. Not sad or scared or anything. It's just off-putting.",top,Recurring dream about my SO leaving me,2.0
0.0,7rd37x,0.0,2.0,"Seriously, it was just a regular dream up until the moment I started browsing Youtube or some news site on a computer (or iPad, idek). In the dream, I believe there was an article someone had written about some guy who had filmed himself torturing and killing a bunch of robins he'd seemingly kept in his basement or something.
There were a couple of screenshots from the video that didn't show anything graphic EXCEPT for, like-- a skull of a duck that the guy held in front of the robins, who pecked a little at it curiously. You could tell it was a duck's skull because of the beak; other than that, it was ""just"" a bit bloody.

Now, I immediately knew just from those screenshots and snippets that this was NOT something I wanted to watch, but I did browse the comment-section (like a moron), and saw the usual edgy stuff you see on YT. People were joking about it, and some asshole said (jokingly, obviously, but it wasn't funny) that he'd ""made a CD"" from the birds' screaming once the guy had started torturing them. Then there was a sane person commenting on how watching robins get hurt like that felt like a personal attack on his childhood almost, since he'd loved robins ever since he was a kid.

Anyway, after that point, I would say I was attempting to wake up from the dream because I felt such a sense of dread, sadness and disgust that I just couldn't bear being within the dream anymore. However, as I was waking up, my mind still conjured up some ""nice"" images and clips for me... of the poor birds getting their wings cut off with scissors by the sick fuck who made the video, and stuff like that.


This dream took me by so much surprise that I just lay there in bed all shaken up and upset while I started looking up info about whether this had anything to do with intrusive thoughts or not... I don't know. Still, I was so mentally upset that I went to my mom to ask if I could sleep in her bed for a few hours. 


I had this dream last night, and all throughout the day, I've seen robins on pictures and things a few times, and I still haven't really gotten over what I saw in the dream.
I hear that dreaming of robins is a good sign, but killing robins obviously isn't. But, I wasn't the one hurting and killing them in the dream (I was just an unfortunate onlooker), so basically I'm wondering what you guys believe this whole dream-turned-nightmare means?
